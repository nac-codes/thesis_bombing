nformed about the real effects of the attacks. Look- ing at the purely tactical and immediate aspects of the railroad campaign, many saw only that the Germans must be getting at least an essential minimum of supplies forward. Bad weather interfered with reconnaissance. The Allies had broken the German railroad administration code, but processing the enormous number of intercepted messages had a low priority. Nevertheless, remarks in other kinds of messages, which were processed, should have shown that transpor- tation attacks were having a tremendous impact. In a message sent on October 20, and deciphered four days later, the Wehrmacht high command quoted Speer as reporting that 30-35 percent of armaments plants were at a standstill because of the destruction of traffic and lack of electric power-the latter due to the grow- ing coal shortage. There was much grumbling about the emphasis on transportation, especially in the CSTC, which was dominated by oil advocates. It favored attacks on the canals, but not bombing railroads. Until 1945 it remained skeptical of the effects of attacks on transportation, and Tedder had to force it to form a transporta- tion subcommittee in October. He was the decisive force in keeping the cam- paign going. He concluded during October that it was too scattered and not adequately planned, and urged greater concentration against Ruhr and Rhine valley rail centers. Tedder secured an agreement on an exclusive second priority for German transportation, after oil. On November 1 Spaatz and Bottomley issued a new directive. It dropped tank and vehicle production and ordnance depots as major targets and made "German lines of communication," with "particular emphasis on the Ruhr," the second priority for the strategic forces.6 The term "German lines of communication" was designed to stress the concentration of effort in proximity to the front, and to placate the ground commanders for the loss of direct support that Tedder wished to arrange.
