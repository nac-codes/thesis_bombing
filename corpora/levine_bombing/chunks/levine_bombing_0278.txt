e Ruhr was stopped from October 14 to 18; after that, only a fifth of the usual hundred coal trains daily left the region. Coal, the biggest item, piled up at the Ruhr mines, and iron ore failed to reach the steel plants of the region. Despite an emphasis on coal, car loadings of coal fell 39 percent in October. By November coal deliveries to factories in Bavaria had fallen by nearly 50 percent, and coal probably held up better than other commer- cial traffic. The Saar had already collapsed, and Upper Silesia could not make up for the losses from the Ruhr. Confusion spread from the Ruhr, and Silesia was already suffering from air attack. The average daily allocation of freight cars to coal movement in Germany as a whole fell steadily, from 127,000 in August 1944 (as compared to 134,000 in August 1943) to 115,000 in September, 105,000 in October, 99,000 in November, and 83,000 in December. Total monthly car loadings fell from 3,940,944 in August to 3,442,133 in September, 3,241,506 in October, 2,976,302 in November, and 2,570,707 in December. War production reeled toward collapse; in November and December stocks of coal and raw materials outside the Ruhr, and of finished parts everywhere, were used up, and much of what was made could not be moved. The production effort, assisted by a last partial recovery in oil pro- duction, had lasted long enough to equip and fuel the German forces for one last throw, but they could not be sustained for much longer. Effective as the transportation campaign was, it might have achieved quicker results with more concentration and better use of the available resources. As Alfred Mierzejewski has noted, a concerted assault on just eight major marshalling yards controlling traffic from the Ruhr-Hamm, Hohenbudberg, Soest, Geisecke, Hagen, Vorhalle, Wedau, and MÃ¼nster-and on the marshalling yards in the two Reichsbahn directorates of Halle and Oppeln, in central and eastern Ger- many, would have quickly wrecked the whole system. Even quick
