largely due to repairs to major synthetic plants. The output of the small benzol plants actually fell; they were only now being singled out for attack, and many that had not been spotted suffered in area attacks on the Ruhr. As noted earlier, Allied reconnaissance was not keeping up with the offen- sive. There were too few reconnaissance planes, and their losses, small earlier, were rising as jets intercepted them. To supplement the specialized reconnaissance planes, cameras were installed in some ordinary fighters, but bad weather and smoke screens sometimes prevented any assessments. On October 18 the CSTC resolved to do something Speer had feared for months: return to oil targets at short intervals without regard to reconnaissance or the lack of it. Weather and other things delayed this decision from being carried out; had it been implemented earlier, it would have denied the Germans the intervals between completion of repairs and Allied detection of recovery, during which they had produced much fuel. 171 During October the Allies realized that German fuel production was recovering. The USSTAF pressured the British to attack oil more. Portal was in the midst of a rather too gentle debate over oil with Harris, who still saw it as just another "panacea target." During November Harris, though still insisting that he was right, found it prudent to cave in to some extent. That month Bomber Command launched eleven day and five night attacks on oil targets, for the first time attack- ing refineries at Harburg; 24.6 percent of the tonnage of bombs dropped in November was aimed at oil targets, compared with 6 percent in October. During December, between bad weather and the "distraction" of the German attack in the Ardennes, Bomber Command actually took over much of the burden of the oil offensive, with two daylight and three night operations. For a time Harris had resisted attacking the bigger and more distant plants at Merseburg-Leuna and Poelitz, claiming that it would
