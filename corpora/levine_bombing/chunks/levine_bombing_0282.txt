of the oil offensive, with two daylight and three night operations. For a time Harris had resisted attacking the bigger and more distant plants at Merseburg-Leuna and Poelitz, claiming that it would be too costly, but attacks on them in December showed that, as so often before, Harris had been wrong. Only 4 of the 497 bombers sent to Merseburg-Leuna, and 3 of the 207 attacking Poelitz, went down. Losses were no greater than those suffered in attacks on closer objectives. Apparently Harris was still unenthusiastic about the oil campaign, as suggested by Portal's complaint that he could have sent a force three times as big to Poelitz. British losses were now low, Of 5,194 planes sent against oil plants in October- December 1944, only 57 were lost. Unfortunately, the RAF's growing efforts still did not make up for the weather difficulties afflicting the Americans. Although 37,096 tons of bombs were dropped on oil targets in November, more than in any other month of the war, this was not reflected in the damage done. The Eighth Air Force attacked oil targets on thirteen days in November, but visual bombing was possible on only four days. GERMAN RESISTANCE IN THE AIR The Luftwaffe sometimes opposed American attacks in central and eastern Germany, especially on oil targets. It occasionally inflicted awful losses. On September 27, during a mission to the Tiger tank plant at Kassel by the 2nd Bombardment Division, the 445th Group made a wrong turn and became separated from the rest of the force. A Sturmgruppe swarmed all over it, shooting down 25 of 37 B-24s in a few minutes, before Mustangs came to the rescue, down- ing 18 German fighters. This was the heaviest loss of any Eighth Air Force group on a single mission of the whole war. But the 445th Group nevertheless returned to Kassel with the rest of the 2nd Division the next day. There were big battles with German conventional fighters on September 28 and October 6 and 7. Using high cloud as cover, Sturmgruppen jumped ex
