18 percent on military and naval targets. Decisive Offensives II: Transportation 173 Harris's ability to persist in the area offensive, despite inter-Allied directives, and the views of Portal and the Air Staff (not to mention reason and evidence) defies fully satisfactory explanation to this day. His close relationship with Churchill, whom he saw often, evidently deterred Portal from disciplining or replacing him. His dismissal, it was thought, would mean a scandal even if the Prime Minister did not intervene to stop it. Churchill may not have had a burning interest in the strategic air war by this time, but he had never evinced any disapproval of the area offensive, or interest in alternative strategies. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Churchill would have opposed a joint insistence by the British chiefs of staff that Bomber Com- mand follow the priorities agreed on with the Americans. Fundamentally, Portal was unwilling to argue with the Prime Minister, or expose the fact that he was not fully in control of the RAF. He tried to "persuade" Harris, without effect. On November 1 Harris rejected abandoning the area offensive as foolish; he insisted that it was near completion. It was only necessary to destroy Magdeburg, Halle, Leipzig, Dresden, Chemnitz, Breslau, Nuremburg, Munich, Koblenz, and Karlsruhe, and finish off Berlin and Hannover. (Later, on January 18, 1945, he declared that it would also be necessary to destroy Erfurt, Gotha, Weimar, Eisenach, and "Posen"-actually the Polish city of Poznan, off limits to area attack under the existing rules.) The "debate" lasted for months. Portal's arguments for the oil plan, and observation that Harris himself admitted that cities hit by area attacks were not totally destroyed, but recovered their industrial output in four or five months, simply bounced off. The area offensive continued to the end of the war; in fact, as we shall see, one infamous series of area attacks was backed by Portal himself. The area attacks
