nearer home. On the last day of 1944 the Eighth managed to mount a strategic mission; the 3rd Divi- sion sent 526 bombers to attack the oil refineries at Hamburg and Misburg. On January 1 perhaps as many as 1,100 German fighters carried out a low- level attack on Allied forward air bases in Belgium and the Netherlands. The Germans achieved surprise, and destroyed about 300 planes, mostly on the ground. But their flying and shooting were bad, and Allied fighters took a heavy toll. The Germans lost about 300 planes themselves; 151 pilots were killed or wounded and 63 captured. Allied operations were not much affected, and the losses were quickly replaced. The "success" was just another nail in the Luft- waffe's coffin. The results of the heavy bomber attacks on marshalling yards and bridges are hard to distinguish from those of attacks by the tactical air forces, but all  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 176 Decisive Offensives II: Transportation air operations together had a terrific impact. Air power did not, of itself, defeat the Ardennes offensive. The German plans had been too optimistic, and went awry in the first 48 hours, at a time when both German and Allied planes were mostly grounded because of delays imposed by small American ground units. But aircraft wrecked the German supply arrangements and helped insure that the Germans were halted and driven back relatively quickly. Peter Elstob later concluded, "It was the almost complete disruption of communication which did most to halt the Ardennes offensive." The localized transportation attack caused the collapse of the German railroads just behind the battle front. This soon spread to the rest of the system.11 A NEW DIRECTIVE As the Ardennes battle ended, there was intense gloom among the Western Allied leaders. It was seen not as a last-gasp effort but as evidence that the enemy was still strong. They feared that the enemy would succeed in putting large numbers of jets and new-type submarines into action. Un
