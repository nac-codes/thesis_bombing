Force had maintained the strategic air offensive with help from the RAF; it had kept up strong blows against the Sile- sian synthetic oil plants and the Austrian refineries. Then it was grounded by weather until January 20. The Eighth Air Force, despite its "release" by Eisenhower on January 8, did not return to the oil campaign until January 14. Then, as the 1st Division attacked some Rhine bridges, the 2nd and 3rd Divi- sions struck synthetic plants at Magdeburg, a refinery at Hemmingstedt, and oil storage depots. For the first time in many weeks, and for the last time, a big force of conventional fighters tried to stop them. American and British fighter pilots ran wild. The Americans claimed to have shot down 155 German fighters while losing 11 fighters themselves; 5 more American fighters had to be scrapped. The British claimed 11 FW-190s, while losing 2 Spitfires. Only 7 bombers went down that day, although 5 more never flew again. The Germans actually lost 150 planes and 107 pilots killed or missing. It was the climactic air battle of the strategic air war. Although the Luftwaffe still had some tricks up its sleeve, it never again intercepted an Allied bomber force in strength. Many of the sur- viving conventional fighters were sent to face the Soviets. But the fuel situation was so bad that the Germans were towing planes from dispersal to runways with horses and oxen, on the rare occasions that the planes flew at all. The Allies were taking on other targets in the last stages of the offensive. Tank plants, U-boat yards, jet plants, and airfields, and in the very last weeks, ex- plosives plants, came under attack, often quite effectively. The Allied forces were now so strong, and the cumulative damage to oil and transportation so great, that attacks on other targets were not the dangerous diversions they had been earlier. But the very success of the oil and transportation campaigns arguably rendered them unnecessary. The nature of the oil campaign changed som
