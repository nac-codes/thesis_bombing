ets were not the dangerous diversions they had been earlier. But the very success of the oil and transportation campaigns arguably rendered them unnecessary. The nature of the oil campaign changed somewhat. For the USSTAF it was very much a case of "doing business at the same old stand" over and over again, but the intensity and scope of the RAF operations were now greater. Bigger RAF forces were sent out, and they struck not only the Ruhr plants and those at Merseburg-Leuna and Poelitz, but the big Bergius plant at Brux; three of the central German synthetic plants, at Zeitz, Lutzkendorf, and BÃ¶hlen; and oil refineries at Hamburg, Harburg, and Misburg, as well as five large oil storage depots. Such depots, in which the fuel was in underground tanks, had not been considered vulnerable to bombs. But small attacks by Bomber Command, and  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 182 Decisive Offensives II: Transportation somewhat larger ones by the Americans, wrecked the above-ground installa- tions and denied the enemy fuel. Weather, not German opposition, was the problem in January and much of February. Serious blows were delivered against oil targets only with great dif- ficulty. On January 14-15, Bomber Command delivered a terrific blow against Merseburg-Leuna. A force of 561 bombers had to aim at sky markers; never- theless, 2,000 tons of bombs were dropped accurately. On January 16 the Eighth hit the oil plants at Magdeburg and Ruhland, as well as tank plants; on January 17 it returned to the Hamburg-area refineries and also struck a U-boat yard there. During the rest of January, terrible weather let the Eighth mount only very small and difficult missions-only one employed more than 100 planes- against a few oil plants and tank plants. The Fifteenth Air Force hit an oil depot at Regensburg and Vienna-area refineries, on a modest scale, before being grounded entirely for nine days. On January 31 it managed a big attack on a large benzol plant at Vienna, before being shut
