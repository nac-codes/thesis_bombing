t at Regensburg and Vienna-area refineries, on a modest scale, before being grounded entirely for nine days. On January 31 it managed a big attack on a large benzol plant at Vienna, before being shut out of Central Europe by weather for another four days. On January 19 Speer had noted, in a report to Hitler, an intensification of the oil attack. Merseburg-Leuna, Poelitz, Brux, Blechhammer, and Zeitz were now out of operation for a considerable period. All the hydrogenation plants further west had been knocked out. Underground plants would not be in opera- tion in the near future. He noted that the night attacks were much more effective than those during the day, "since heavier bombs are used and an extraordinary accuracy in attaining the target is reported." Complete and reliable figures for many aspects of German fuel production in 1945 are not available, but it seems that the total output of the hydrogenation plants fell from 56,000 tons in December to 37,000 tons in January. Benzol production appears to have declined. from 27,800 tons in December to 20,000 in January. Rubber production had already fallen to 15 percent of the level of early 1944, while nitrogen production fell to 25 percent of the level of October 1944. When the weather lifted, the strategic picture had changed considerably. Upper Silesia, which had been the Germans' last relatively intact heavy industry area, and the Hungarian oilfields and refineries had fallen or were falling into Soviet hands. On February 8 Eisenhower launched the final offensive in the West. Much of the British and American heavy bombers' effort went either to support the battle for the Rhineland or to make the special series of attacks designed to sup- port the Soviet advance in the east. During much of February the weather was poor. Most American attacks were delivered on radar, many against the mar- shalling yards, which made relatively good targets. With the bombers flying whenever the weather was not utterly impossible,
