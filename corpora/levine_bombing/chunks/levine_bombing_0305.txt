d that Tallboys penetrated the bunkers protecting the U-boats, while Mosquitos dropped 4,000-pound bombs on construction slips. The main constraint on building new U-boats, however, was probably the transportation problem. The Germans had prefabricated their new U-boats at inland sites; only the final assembly took  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 184 place in the traditional shipyards. This was a good counter to the sort of cam- paign against submarine yards that had been waged in 1943, but the attacks on the canals made it hard to get the various sections to the ports. In all, bomb- ing is estimated to have cost the Germans the production of 30 of the large Type 21 submarines and 14 of the shorter-range Type 23s, while Allied bombers sank 15 finished Type 21s and one Type 23, as well as 18 older U-boats.17 THE LAST STRUGGLE OF THE LUFTWAFFE Despite some successful attacks on plants, the Germans continued making jet fighters. Late in 1944 they even embarked on a wild project to produce a cheap, small "people's fighter," the Heinkel 162, to be flown by boys from the Hitler Youth. It was aerodynamically unsound and at best could only have been handl- ed by a very experienced pilot, and the hundred or so built were never used operationally. Possibly the Luftwaffe command had the sense to see that this particular scheme was useless. The fighter versions of the Me-262, operated by Jagdgeschwader 7 and Kamp- fgeschwader (J) 54 (the latter a fighter-bomber unit) were more dangerous. After rarely appearing for some weeks, they attacked bombers heading for Lutzken- dorf on February 9, shooting down one. JG 7 did not become fully operational until March, and it never reached full strength, but it had better trained pilots than Kommando Nowotny. Another, smaller jet fighter unit, Jagdverbande 44. was formed in February. Galland, ousted as inspector of fighters for insufficient pandering to the fantasies of the Nazi leaders, had been allowed to form this squadron-sized unit,
