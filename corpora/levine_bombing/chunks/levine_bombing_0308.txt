ere complete; but no more than 200 were ever operational. They had destroyed only about 150 Allied planes, while 100 of the German jets were lost in air combat.18 THE FINAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST GERMAN TRANSPORTATION The final collapse of the Germans' ability to sustain their war effort was caused by the concentrated Allied attack on transportation. In the last stages of the transportation campaign, the efforts of the strategic and tactical air forces con- verged. The latter's attacks on supply lines near the front merged with the heavy bombers' attacks on the transportation system as a whole. The Allies did not realize how effective their attacks had been, and that the German economy was already collapsing. By January German rail traffic had fallen to 40 percent of the level before the transportation campaign had begun. What was left of the marshalling yards and sidings were so jammed with cars that could no longer be formed into trains that on December 9 the Germans began derailing vast numbers of cars to free space. Coal traffic had sunk so low  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 186 Decisive Offensives II: Transportation that all factory workers were furloughed from December 24 to January 1 to con- serve fuel. Coal stocks outside the Ruhr dwindled to a few days' supply, and most of the stocks of parts that had allowed the continuation of arms production were used up during December. Weapons production fell steeply in January 1945, declining 30 percent from its peak in July 1944. Coal and coke piled up in the Ruhr; mining was cut back. Elsewhere, locomotives lacked coal, while weapons and ammunition that could not be moved jammed factory yards and warehouses. Within the Ruhr, steel production fell to a third of the normal level. The steady. although insufficiently systematic, attack on the marshalling yards had largely isolated the Ruhr by early 1945; Speer's ministry described the region as an "island" on January 18. On January 30 Speer reported to Hitler that the war
