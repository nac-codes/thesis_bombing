y was secured during February by a revision of the intelligence picture. After the Battle of the Bulge, Bottomley had ordered a review of the handling of "ultra" information related to the attack on transportation. It showed that vast numbers of messages on the German economy had been intercepted but ignored, and that, at least as early as October, German war production had been in steep decline. On February 10 Eisenhower's headquarters and the CSTC agreed to isolate the Ruhr, to paralyze both commercial traffic and troop movements. This was part of the preparation for Eisenhower's planned double envelopment of the area, after the main crossing of the Rhine was made in the north. The Ruhr isolation plan was actually formulated by the Ninth Air Force. Both heavy and medium bombers would hit marshalling yards, but there was a new 187 emphasis on interdiction-breaking down the eighteen bridges and viaducts that connected the Ruhr with the rest of Germany. Some of the targets were far from the Ruhr proper; they ranged from the Arnsbergen Bridge over the Weser, near Bremen, to Neuwied, on the Rhine well above the Ruhr. The plan really in- volved the isolation of all of northwest Germany. Six of the eighteen targets were allotted to the strategic air forces, the rest to the tactical air forces.20 Although not formally approved until March 1, the plan was put into opera- tion on February 21. The Ruhr and the neighboring interdiction targets took a fearful pounding. Allied heavy and medium bombers dropped 31,635 tons of bombs on transport targets within the Ruhr in the first three weeks of March, while from February 21 to March 21, 5,657 tons of bombs were dropped on the critical bridges and viaducts. The finishing touch to the six targets given to the strategic air forces was sup- plied by the huge British bombs. The Bielefeld Viaduct was smashed with Tallboys on February 22 but once again was repaired. The British now introduced the Grand Slam, the full-scale "earthquake
