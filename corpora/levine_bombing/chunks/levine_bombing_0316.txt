m of area bombing, indeed night bombing in general, is easily misunderstood. The difference between precision and area bombing was not a sharp distinction, but one between varying shades in a spectrum. Up to 1942, neither was possible. As capabilities improved during that year, successful area bombing became possible, but it was still not a regular or dependable result. At the same time, attacks on some specific factories-for example, the Renault plant-became possible, but only in unusual conditions of weather and moonlight, and against light defenses. After the introduction of Oboe and other aids in 1943, area bombing attacks were usually successful, at least within Oboe range, while precision attacks on very large factories also became possible, even in difficult and heavily defended areas like the Ruhr. Real precision bombing at night, against most important targets, became possible in the latter half of 1943, probably by the late summer, even though the capability for it was not exploited until well into 1944. Yet another misunderstood watershed for Bomber Command was its recovery of the ability to penetrate deep into Germany in the summer of 1944. It appears that this was due primarily to the belated development of countermeasures to the Germans' radar and homing devices, and not, as is usually said, to the crippling of the German defenses by the loss of territory and gasoline. 191 The Army Air Force's actions have also sometimes been misunderstood. Its leaders, or at least those on the spot in Europe, were disillusioned with the self- defending bomber formation long before the disastrous losses of the summer and fall of 1943. The deep-penetration attacks were a gamble, to keep the offen- sive against aircraft and ball bearings going until fighter escort became available. The failure of these attacks was not due just to the fact that unescorted attacks were too horribly costly even as an occasional venture. The selection of ball bearings as an objective proved
