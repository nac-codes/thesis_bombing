armies, completely bereft of ammunition and motive power, would almost certainly have had to cease fighting by June or July."8 It should be noted that even in these offensives the effect of strategic bombing cannot be isolated from other operations. By capturing Ploesti, and later the Hungarian oilfields and the easternmost German synthetic oil plants, the Soviets enabled the Fifteenth Air Force to concentrate its efforts on a smaller number of targets in the last part of the war, while the capture of Upper Silesia precipitated the final collapse of the German economy. There seems to be little reason, however, to assume that the Western air forces would not have finished off the oil industry and isolated Silesia, as they did the Ruhr, even had the Red Army never reached those areas. The Soviet advance affected the duration rather than the outcome of the oil and transportation campaigns. But the Allied air forces made bad mistakes and missed major opportunities to harm the Nazis, even during the successful final offensives. Had the RAF used its capability of attacking precise objectives, it might have begun dealing with the oil industry in late 1943. As the AAF's historians later admitted, and the Combined Chiefs suggested at the time, the USSTAF should have attacked the synthetic oil plants during Big Week, instead of pursuing the campaigns against aircraft and ball bearing production. Had the attack on oil started earlier, it would have taken ef- fect more quickly, since the Germans would not have had the chance to accumulate reserves of fuel. The battle for air superiority could have been won just as well over the oil plants as over the aircraft and ball bearings plants-indeed, more easily, since the oil plants in central Germany were less distant than Berlin was. 195 Above all, the oil offensive was hurt by the RAF's inadequate participation. Even before it regained the ability to fly deep into Germany in July 1944, it could have hit the northwestern oil refiner
