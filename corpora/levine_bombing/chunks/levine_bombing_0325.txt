e first and last assumptions were disproven by events, and it took years for the British to gain the ability to carry out accurate attacks at night. The whole unsatisfactory practice of area attack was a result of the change to night operations. Had the RAF banked on developing long-range fighters instead, it would have had to forego attacking Germany for a long time. But it is likely that, by early 1943 at the latest, it would have had a plane like the Mustang (if not the Mustang itself) and would have been able to bomb accurately anywhere in Germany in daylight. With American help, it could have started decisive offensives against oil and transportation in 1943. World War II would have taken a radically dif- ferent course. Given the switch to night bombing, which could not be accurate for a long time, it would have been wise to slow the buildup of Bomber Command in favor  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 196 of Coastal Command's antisubmarine activities, as was done to some extent. This would have led to earlier victory in the Battle of the Atlantic and would have been a more effective employment of bomber-type aircraft than were the attacks on Germany in the early years of the war. A smaller Bomber Command could have continued to bomb Germany, pinning down German resources in defense and gaining operational experience for the day when effective attacks could take place. Through much of 1943 there was little alternative to area bombing. But had the British leaders regarded general area attack as a last resort, instead of embracing it, they might have handled things differently even in 1942 and early 1943, better exploiting what limited capability for attacking specific targets they had. They could have placed more emphasis on developing new techniques for precision attack at night, and tailoring the target list to suit Bomber Command's limitations, they could have concentrated against industry more than they did. Even in 1942 precision attack was possible against
