s already won, ruled against long-range development programs and Germany failed to produce sound follow- ons to the planes it had in 1939. While the Allies produced many new types of planes, some of which, like the Mustang, were designed after the war began, Germany introduced only one new type of plane on a large scale, the Focke- Wulf 190. It also lagged behind in developing high-octane aviation gasoline. Much of its resources were wasted on the rocket fighter and the Army's V-2 program, but contrary to a widespread myth, Germany was not ahead in jet development, and while its jet fighter development was mismanaged, it is doubtful that even an all-out effort to get the Heinkel 280 into action would have had much effect. Given its lack of alloy materials, instead of developing jet fighters and rocket- powered ballistic missiles that could not be accurately aimed, the Germans might have been wiser to concentrate on getting the most advanced possible piston- engine successor to the Me-109 and FW-190, and antiaircraft missiles. Instead of the V-1 and V-2, the Germans could have tried to develop a turbojet-powered cruise missile with some type of command guidance system, capable of attacking  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 200 Conclusions precision targets like factories and ships. A weapon with a warhead comparable to that on the V-1, but steerable to a small target, would have been a dangerous threat to the Allies. Had even the pulse-jet-powered V-1 been a little faster, it would have been extremely hard for Allied fighters to catch. A faster, turbojet- powered missile might have been nearly immune to the Allied propeller-driven interceptors, while the short life and unreliability of the German jet engines would have mattered less in a missile than in a manned aircraft. Eventually the Allies would probably have jammed any radio-guidance systems the Germans could have developed for either antiaircraft or offensive missiles, but a combina- tion of fast fighters like
