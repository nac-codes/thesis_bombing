apanese supplies of rubber would have rendered synthetic rubber unimportant as a target, while the Baku oilfields alone pro- duced two and a half times as much oil as all of Axis Europe, so the oil plants might have become a much less important target. (The responsible German officials, however, had serious doubts about whether they could transport much oil from the Caucasus to Germany.)12  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 202 Notes Had the Germans had access to large oil supplies in the east, the Allies might have successfully switched their attention to the German electric power system. Prewar planners had singled this out as a good target system, but it was neglected during the war. Postwar examination, however, confirmed that it would have been vulnerable to bombing. Although the number of targets in the electric power system was larger, and the targets themselves smaller than those involved in oil production, there would have been no way for the Germans to get around their destruction; they later estimated that a loss of 60 percent of their electric power would have produced a collapse of production.13 Campaigns against elec- tric power and transportation would eventually have reduced Germany to helplessness, and it is hard to see how the Nazi regime could have survived. But it seems doubtful whether conventional bombing would have taken full effect before atomic weapons became available. CHAPTER 1 1. B. H.
