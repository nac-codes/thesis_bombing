ponsible for the planning and operational levels of air campaigns and had significant input on the question of terror bombing. Spaatz was the commander most associated with what would become known as precision bombing tactics. Another of the great pioneer airmen who was a contemporary of General Arnold was Ira Eaker. Eaker met Arnold and Spaatz at Rockwell Field in 1918 after which the three became friends and colleagues for life. Eaker was active during the inter-war period, serving as General Douglas MacArthur's pilot, and he participated in record- breaking flights as well as promoting air power in various public relations activities. During the war Eaker joined Spaatz in England as head of the 7th Bomber Command and eventually the 8th Air Force. In early 1944 Eaker moved to Italy to head the Mediterranean Allied Air Force and then commanded in the Far East. Eaker was instrumental in the build-up of American air forces in the European theater. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

Early in his career, Walker served as a bombardment instructor (1929 -19 34), an education that would later serve him well. Walker, along with Spaatz and Eaker, Hansell, and Kenney, was one of Arnold's friends from the early days of the Air Corps. During the war Walker served in the Pacific and put into practice his firm belief that the "well organized, well planned, and well-flown air force will constitute an offensive that cannot be stopped." W alker was one in a long line of airmen who firmly believed that air power would be a decisive factor in war. He was lost during a raid on Rabaul in January 1943. Haywood S. Hansell was another man who taught bombardment theory at the Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) and later served as planner and commander during the war. Hansell played a
