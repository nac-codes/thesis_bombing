ul in January 1943. Haywood S. Hansell was another man who taught bombardment theory at the Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) and later served as planner and commander during the war. Hansell played a m ajor role in formulating the strategic air plans used against Germany. In 1944, Hansell was sent to the Pacific to command the 20th  Air Force. He was in charge of the new formation of B-29 Bombers but his command proved hopeless. The new bombers were having severe teething problems, the weather was abysmal, and distances were enormous, causing numerous supply problems. After a short tenure which produced few results, Hansell was replaced by an impatient Arnold. Curtis LeMay, Hansell's replacement, is one of the icons of American military history. LeMay began as a group commander in the 8th  Air Force and was rapidly promoted to a Major General. He gained a reputation as a problem solver, which endeared him to Arnold, who was always looking for men who could produce results in the shortest time possible. Arnold chose LeMay to get the new B-29 into operation, which LeMay did by abandoning the-long held doctrine of high altitude bombing. It was under LeMay's command that most of the damage would be done Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

George Kenney was another one of Arnold's most trusted generals. Kenney was appointed commanding general in the South East Pacific in 1942 and served in that position until the end of the war. More than any other of his commanders, Kenney had access to Arnold's innermost thoughts about the war. Often Arnold and Kenney were at odds about strategy, and it is through their frank exchanges, which we will examine later in this paper, that we can gain a deeper insight into Arnold's views on the war in the Pacific.
