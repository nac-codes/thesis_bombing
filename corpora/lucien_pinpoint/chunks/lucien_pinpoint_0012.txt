orces. However, those airmen who had been directly involved with air operations during the war argued for a much more vigorous and independent role for the airplane. In America, the most prominent early proponent of air power was General Billy Mitchell. Mitchell enthusiastically set forth his views on the capability of the bomber. When Mitchell arrived in Europe, he quickly became one of the most popular and energetic air officers, gathering around him young airmen who were eager to find new ways to use the airplane in battle. Many of these young airmen would become commanders in WW II. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

"The bombardment people are sure that if they are given enough planes and explosives, there would be nothing left of Germany in a short while."1  In September 1918, in the Meuse-Argonne area, Mitchell organized one of the largest air operations of the war. As the war ended, he was planning an even greater use of air power, this tim e to include night and day bombing operations against Germany.2  However, the war ended too soon for Mitchell to be able to demonstrate the capabilities of the American air arm. Against sustained military and political opposition, he would spend the rest of his life trying to prove the worth of air power. Airmen and policymakers in other countries were often just as enthusiastic and forceful as Mitchell in advocating air power. For example, the South African Field Marshal Jan Christian Smuts wrote in his second report on air to the Prime Minister in August 1917: The time is, however, rapidly approaching when the subordination of the Air Service can no longer be justified . . .  As far as can at present be foreseen there is absolutely no limit to the scale of its future war use, and the day may not be far off when aerial
