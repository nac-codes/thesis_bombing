ng Mission was considered one of the most significant fact-finding missions for the future of American air doctrine. In the middle of 1917, Colonel Bolling and Major Gorrell, one of the two signal corps aeronautical engineers in the mission, sought technical information on the current fighting aircraft in the air forces of the allies. The members of the mission were deeply impressed with the scope and success of the Italian strategic bombardment effort. Gianni Caproni, Douhet's dose friend, was one of the most important single sources of influence on the Bolling mission. At this point in the war, Italy was the only allied country with a functioning long-range bombing program. In an article by Boone Atkinson, "Italian Influences on the Origins of the American Concept of Strategic Bombardment," he shows that Caproni gave Gorrell data on German targets while he was planning the American Strategic bombing campaign 1918. Although it would be a mistake to assume that Caproni was the only influence on Gorrell, it is clear that Italian influence played an J.

These Italian ideas led proponents of bombing to foresee a future in which high explosive, incendiary, and gas bombs would blast factories, burn cities, and poison civilians.
