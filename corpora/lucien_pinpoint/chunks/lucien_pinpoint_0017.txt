on after World W ar I. Douhet was one of the radical visionaries who argued th at the airplane could be a decisive weapon in future wars. Douhet confronted the issue of civilian deaths, changing in the process the definition of combatant and noncombatant. He envisioned armadas of warplanes attacking the vital centers of an enemy nation to paralyze and destroy the population with poison gas, incendiary bombs, and explosives. The terrorized civilians would then force their governments to surrender. In a future war, bombers would spare the lives of soldiers by moving the battlefield from the trenches to the cities.9 Because Douhet's theories were rooted in the nineteenth century doctrine of the Prussian military theorist, Karl von Clausewitz, his perspective was decidedly amoral. Douhet, like Clausewitz, considered war to be an act by which one nation forced another to do its will. In this view, war was conceived in its most extreme form as a conflict without limits. The experience of World W ar One taught Douhet that modern war was a conflict that employed the entire material and human resources of a nation, a struggle in which there was no moral distinction between civilian and combatant. From this perspective the primary object of m ilitary action was not an enemy's armed force but the enemy's source of m ilitary power, which could be attacked from the air.
