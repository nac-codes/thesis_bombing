out of the First World War convinced that air power would be decisive in the next war. In America, the air power debate was dominated by the issues of pursuit aircraft vs. the heavy long-range bomber. As in Britain and Germany, the American air establishment was enthralled with the potential power of the strategic bomber. As in Germany and Britain, the traditional Army and Navy leadership was more concerned with pursuit and tactical aircraft. The first example of an American strategic bombing campaign was one proposed by Lt. Col. Edgar Staley Gorrell and his staff on November 28, 1917. The plan called for an around-the-clock air offensive against German commercial centers and lines of communication. Gorrell had been a member of the Bolling group which had visited Britain, France, and Italy in an effort to determine the best method of using American air power. In August 1917, Bolling submitted a report in which he recommended that America build as many aircraft as possible. He found the prospects of a night air offensive appealing and noted that if bombing were Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

Unfortunately, the relevance of Bolling's findings was lost as his third-place mention of the strategic force was apparently taken to mean that it was third order of importance.1 5  At any rate, the force necessary to carry out such a plan was never built. By this time, Billy Mitchell had become fam iliar with the ideas of the commander of the Royal Flying Corps, General Hugh Trenchard. Mitchell was unwilling to give up the idea of a sustained bombing campaign against Germany.
