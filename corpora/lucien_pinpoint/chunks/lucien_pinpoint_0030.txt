The only attack that theorists could envision during this period was one borne by a fleet of carrier-based planes. The coastal defense mission provided 2 1 . Boyle,Trenchard: Man of Vision 383. ~.

The weapon of choice for this task was the four-engine bomber because of its range. The real advantage for the Air Service was that such a machine could also be used for offensive purposes in a future war. In short, although Army air leaders were arguing for costal defense, they were building the foundation for an offensive air arm that would be independent of ground commanders. The struggle to build such a force was long and hard. It began with Billy Mitchell's demonstration of bombing tactics against obsolete ships in 1921 and 1923. The conclusion drawn by Mitchell from these attacks was that the Air Service should be granted a prominent role in coastal defense.2 3  The Navy, of course, did not come to the same conclusion as it clearly saw the building of a mass air fleet as a threat to its own programs. The debate raged until 1941. Hitler's rise to power and the forming of the Axis alliance among Germany, Italy, and Japan had a clarifying effect upon American strategic thinking. The emphasis on coastal defense no longer seemed so relevant in an increasingly dangerous world. Although the general staff still fought vehemently against the procurement of heavy bombers, strategic thinkers were becoming more interested in a we
