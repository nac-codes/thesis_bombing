bomber could be. Suddenly, the theories of air power strategists and futurists seemed more real. Any nation caught without such weapons was exposing itself to attack. Although Spain showed how horrible bombing could be, American observers noted that air activity in Spain had been limited to support missions which though successful, did not include a sustained strategic campaign. In China, Arnold observed that Japan employed its air forces not merely as artillery platforms, but in a m anner which used modern teachings at the Air Corps tactical School by gaining first air superiority; then they selected enemy airdromes, :4.

The war in Ethiopia again provided American theorists with no new lessons but confirmed those already learned. Ethiopia provided Italy with few strategic targets of the kind one would find in a modern society. However, General Andrews lecturing at the Army War College in October 1936 was impressed by the fact that Italian air power had virtually transformed the Mediterranean into an Italian Lake.2 5  One lesson which was barely mentioned was the brutal nature of the use of air power on civilians. It is significant that although the State Department during this period condemned attacks on innocents in all three cases, military theorists had little comment on the moral aspects of these air wars. Despite these events, the struggle to secure the strategic four-engine bomber was intense. The struggle began in the early 1930's but began in earnest with the development of the B-17 in 1935. The chief obstacle to the B-17's development was its cost and the belief that a twin-engine bomber could accomplish the same task at a much lower cost. From 1935 to 1936, the
