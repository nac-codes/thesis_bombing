ment of the B-17 in 1935. The chief obstacle to the B-17's development was its cost and the belief that a twin-engine bomber could accomplish the same task at a much lower cost. From 1935 to 1936, the General Staff attempted to limit, if not eliminate, funding for the B-17 program. Originally, 65 of the B-17 bombers were ordered on October 1, 1935; however, after the crash of a prototype on October 30, procurement was slowed down. In November, the order was cut back to 13 B-17's and 80 Douglas B-18's two engine bombers. In June 1936, the General Staff concluded th at "until the international situation indicates the need fo ra  long range bomber, no more of that type should be procured except for experimental purposes." And further, the General Staff insisted "that a medium range bombardment type 25. Greer, 102-103. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The key to the success of the B-17 was the support of the administration in a White House conference in September 1938. Arguments for the B-17 were made in a memo by R. A. Lovett, who acted as a liaison between the Air Corps and White House.2 7 Arguments such as heavy bombers are more economical in men and materials, easier to maintain, had greater range, served as a better gun platform, and, more important, were the only weapons which could be used against Germany and Japan in the early stages of any war were all presented to assure the White House and Congress that the B-17 was the right choice.2 8  But success was not taken for granted. In September 1941, the Air Corps was still justifying the mass building of the B-17. While the struggle for th
