d Congress that the B-17 was the right choice.2 8  But success was not taken for granted. In September 1941, the Air Corps was still justifying the mass building of the B-17. While the struggle for the procurement of the long-range bomber was under way, at the Air Service Tactical School much thought was being given to how such a weapon would be used. In 1935, an instructor, Captain Laurence Kuter resurrected Gorrell's 1918 bombardment plan. Kuter saw Gorrell's Plan as "the earliest, clearest, and least known statement of the American conception of the employment of air power."2 9  With the development of the Norden bomb sight in 1931 and the B-17 in 2 6 Arnold Papers,  (June 1936), Reel 5 File 7 2 7 .

In contrast to Trenchard and Douhet, instructors at the tactical school stressed attacking a nation's industrial apparatus rather than its civilian work force. Gorrell's plan meshed well with the Air Corps Tactical School's view of strategic bombing. The Tactical School had developed what became known as the industrial web theory. This theory was developed by an array of brilliant young officer instructors and became a uniquely American philosophy of strategic bombing. American air leaders would ostensibly hold to this concept throughout the war even though the reality became something different. The main points of the strategy were: in modern warfare, the m
