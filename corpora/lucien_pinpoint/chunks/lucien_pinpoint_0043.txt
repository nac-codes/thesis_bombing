It had been a long and difficult struggle against the political and military structure to establish the principles contained in AWPD-1, and there were still many struggles ahead. In the end, it was the support of the White House which gave them  the tools to carry out a strategic bombing campaign. In Europe, Arnold and his staff had to concentrate enough bombers to constitute an effective strike force, while in the Pacific bases had to be found from which to attack Japan. Problems of supply, training, target selection, and personnel would keep Arnold busy for the rest of the war.
