nn's estimates were far too high and that a strategic campaign based on such an analysis would be a wasted effort. Tizard's problem was two fold: In the first place, he did not have a personal relationship with Churchill, and, second, he did not have an alternative plan. In the end Lindermann's strategic concept was accepted, and all opposition was simply swept aside. It seems that even at the highest levels of decision men gravitate toward a simple conception over the complexity of reality. Suffice it to say that the end result was that Bomber Command was ordered to bomb German Urban centers with the aim of disrupting the German economy by killing, wounding, dehousing, and terrorizing civilian workers.

AAF leaders believed that they could succeed where the RAF Bomber Command had failed: in daylight precision bombing. Although there were t
