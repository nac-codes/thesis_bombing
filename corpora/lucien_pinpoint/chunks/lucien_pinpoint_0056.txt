Eaker and Stratemeyer had to deal with a long list of problems, including maintenance, personnel, modifications, and training. Arnold tried to address all of these difficulties by securing more resources from Washington. He would not, however, allow his commanders to use these problems as excuses: " I am not so 5 6 .Arnold Papers,  "Arnold to Hopkins," (January 8, 1943), Reel 168 file 3. S 1 .
