of missions flown, tonnage dropped, airplanes shot down, and factories and city blocks demolished. Arnold's forces were ready to begin the long awaited strategic offensive against Germany by the end of June 1943. As early as October 1942 Arnold's staff had identified the aircraft industry as a main target. Arnold was convinced that "Germany can be defeated most rapidly if immediate steps are taken to prevent her from rebuilding her air force."5 9  With the defeat of the GAF, the Continent would be open to an invasion, and the Nazi regime would be unable to protect German cities.

Significantly, this was the AAF's first attempt to carry out the Industrial Web Theory developed in the mid 1930s and planned in the sum m er of 1941.
