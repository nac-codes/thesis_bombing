War had become much more than target folders and complicated economic studies. The AAF was not yet ready in the fall of 1943 to take the war to the heart of Germany. Out of the hardship came reflection. Although precision bombing was not abandoned, area bombing tactics could now be contemplated.

As a result of political pressure, the heavy losses soon put Arnold on the defensive as he faced a sustained outc
