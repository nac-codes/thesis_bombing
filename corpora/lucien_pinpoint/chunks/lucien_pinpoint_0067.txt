ot designed as an obliteration attack to kill the German population. When Arnold asked for comments, Spaatz proposed instead an alternative operation, SHATTER, which he described as a plan to attack transportation. However, the British had their own plan named Hurricane I& II which was not as careful about civilian casualties. Arnold was not satisfied with SHATTER and proposed a plan simply to terrorize civilians. By the fall of 1944, the Germans had begun to use their V -l and V-2 rockets.7 1  These weapons had been developed during the early 1930s and had reached the point of deployment, although their development was far from complete. The Germans had become enthralled with their Wunderwaffen  and had, in their own way, placed their hopes on a Douhetian outcome. The German plan was that randomly targeted bombs would so panic British civilians that the tide of the war would somehow be reversed.7 2 7 1 . The Americans were very interested to get their hands on both weapons, which eventually became the intercontinental missile and cruise missile. 7 -.

In Arnold's mind, like retaliation was called for. Arnold's plan was to use planes as a means of randomly raining terror down on Germany: My idea would be to turn them loose to land all over Germany so that the Germans would be just as much afraid of our w ar weary plans on account of not knowing just where they are going to hit, as are the people of England from the buzz bombs and rockets. I think that the physiological effect on the morale of the German people would be much greater, not knowing where they were going to fall, and they would have to be constantly on
