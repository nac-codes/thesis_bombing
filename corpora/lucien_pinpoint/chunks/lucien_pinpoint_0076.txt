nders found themselves competing with both Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek and General Joseph Stillwell for limited supplies which had to be flown over the Burma hump. Every tim e supplies over the Burma hump would increase, the generals would increase their demands, thus leaving the AAF short. With so many competing priorities, it was not long before Arnold 8 0 .

It would be a mistake to assume that the B-29 was a much larger version of the B-17, which had been under development since the early 1930's. The B-29 was a totally new plane with many innovations which the B-17 did not possess. Arnold himself put the need for the larger, more sophisticated aircraft directly to FDR: "I wish to advise you that the B-29 is the only bombardment type which can reach Japan . . . because our present B-24's and B-17's do not have sufficient range."82 The development of any new weapon system is a time consuming and costly process. This is especially true for aircraft. One of America's advantages over Japan and Germany was its ability to design and produce new aircraft in a relatively short period of tim e. Both Japan and Germany came up short in this respect. Japan failed to design any new aircraft during the war, and although the Germans did design new aircraft, they could not produce them in numbers to affect the outcome of the war. The B-29, even with its many shortcomings, was a testament to American productive and engineering capabilities. The genesis of the B-29 came in October 1938 when the Air Corps Board recommended a bomber with a minimum radius of 1,500
