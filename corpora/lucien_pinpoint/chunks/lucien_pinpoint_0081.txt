eport detailed, was concentrated in large cities made out of wood th a t were vulnerable to incendiary bombs. "In many cities, constructions are built so closely together that roof coverage average 50%  to 80%  as compared to 35%  to 60%  in Germany." Interspersed in the highly congested cities were numerous small sub-contractors and handicraft industries. Japan relied on these industries to a greater extent than did Germany or the allies. Often these establishments were so small they were run out of the small garages attached to the home. There were many traditional industrial targets in Japan such as coke ovens, oil installations, and transportation facilities, but to really get at Japanese war production, one had to bomb the residential sections where 40%  of Japan's production was located. In Europe, a distinction between residential and industrial areas could, in most cases, be made. In Japan, because of the method of attack and their industrial organization, no clear-cut distinction was possible.8 7 For Arnold and his staff then, urban areas presented an attractive target. The question was not, "should the U.S. target civilians;" rather it was "how much tonnage was needed to cause a conflagration." Arnold continued: s 7 .

File: --- lucien_pinpoint.pdf --- Page 80 --- 73 Tests have been conducted to determine the incendiary vulnerability of Japanese structures. It is estimated as a result of these tests that less than 2000 tons of incendiaries falling within selected areas of 20 cities would produce uncontrollable conflagrations in each of them . Less than 700 tons are estimated for Tokyo, a city of 7,000,000. This is an interesting contrast with Hamburg, a city of 2,000,000, when the RAF dropped 4,849 tons of incendiaries.8 8 The tone of the report suggests the relative ease
