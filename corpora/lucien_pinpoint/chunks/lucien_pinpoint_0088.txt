ng closed around Japan the services were drawn into closer cooperation.9 6 By 1943, Arnold and his staff could get down to planning the destruction of Japan. There were still many frustrations to be dealt with. The first was to wrestle the supplies needed to attack Japan from the Navy. Part of the problem was that the Navy was committed to the concept of island hopping which, in Arnold's view, wasted much time and effort in jungle fighting. The further we can get away from the oid island to island theory of how to beat Japan, the better I will like it. If more people come around to our point of view about using air power to go direct to the heart of Japan, we should be able to 96. Sherry, Michael, The Rise of American Air Power.

We can avoid this by directing our coordinated effort as to put the air weapon in the position calculated best to exploit its capabilities.9 7 Arnold's frustration with the diversion of forces away from his air campaign was reaching the boiling point. In 1943 he expended a great deal of energy on establishing air bases in India and China but had little to show for his efforts. The island-hopping campaign that cost the Navy and Marines so many lives was, in Arnold's estimation, another diversion from this effort. Eventually, Arnold would need these islands from which to attack Japan. On another level, Arnold was echoing the cause of Douhet and the other early air theorists who had viewed the wastage of lives on the battlefields of Europe during World War One. In essence, Arnold wanted to replace the soldier with a machine. Arnold fervently believed that in the long run such a substitution would save lives or, at least, substitute the lives of U.S. soldiers with those of Japanese civilians. By May of 1944, operations
