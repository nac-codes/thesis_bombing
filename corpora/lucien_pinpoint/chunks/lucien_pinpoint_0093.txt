Again, Arnold viewed the situation from a global perspective. He saw isolated Japanese armies causing potential problems for years to come and thought a maximum effort against Japan was still necessary. This effort would include redeployment. In view of my analysis of your letter, I cannot agree with your conclusion that air power already in the Pacific is sufficient to continue the job without help from any source except training centers. This may be due to a difference of opinion as to what the job is. I feel that the defeat of Japan and the elimination of any future threat from the remnant of that nation is our job.1 0 4 Arnold was not convinced by Kenney's analysis that the war was winding down and, consequently, neither should be the American air effort. America had embarked on this war with total victory in mind. Arnold concluded that decisive action was still needed to bring about that victory. He still wanted those B-29's to smash Japanese cities. The fact that Japanese cities were not burning as 1944 was coming to a close was a source of great frustration and concern for him. Arnold would push as hard as ever to get those bombers over Japan even as his health was failing. In his view, now was the time to hit Japan hard. Perhaps a series of devastating raids on Japanese cities could just be enough to push Japan over the edge. Arnold was not going to let his commanders relax and miss the opportunity to show the world what the B-29 could do. Thus, as in Europe, most of the devastation would come after the outcome of the conflict had been decided. Arnold Papers,  "Arnold to Kenney,"
