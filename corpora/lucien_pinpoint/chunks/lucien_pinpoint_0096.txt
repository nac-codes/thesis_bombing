many ways Arnold and LeMay were similar. LeMay drove his subordinates just as hard as Arnold, although not with the same ruthlessness. In Europe, LeMay had been a middle-level commander. Grand strategy was beyond his province. What concerned LeMay was fashioning his command into an effective fighting machine. He was far too busy to worry about strategy. His main concern was locating resources, maintaining his men's fighting spirit and dealing with personnel problems. In this LeMay, like Arnold, was no slave to doctrine.

"We have crews that have been thoroughly trained and should be able to make the trip. We have maintenance personnel which have been specially trained.

He could not justify the expense of this weapon system unless he could show concrete results to the public and top leadership. The only acceptable result was burning Japanese cities. This point was driven home to Arnold's Chief of Staff, General Barney Giles. If we have produced 2000 B-29’s then why aren't they over Japan? Only 60-80 out of 2000 planes are o
