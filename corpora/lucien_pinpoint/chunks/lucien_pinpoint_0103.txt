their part, the British, especially under Chamberlain, were not eager to escalate the w ar.lis After the fall of France and the London Blitz, any reluctance on both sides to attack civilians disappeared. In 1944 the launching of the V -l and V-2 rockets by the Germans was in retaliation for the area bombing that the British had been practicing since 1942. The German V - l and V -2 offensive represented an escalation in the war on civilians in that the relatively primitive guidance system of both missile systems introduced an almost completely random elem ent to the war.

In short, the longer the war lasted, the easier it became to justify open attacks on civilians. The situation in Japan was somewhat different in that the Japanese were never in a position to launch a sustained attack on American civilians, nor were the Americans in such a position until the latter stages of the war. The Japanese showed that they were capable of atrocities with their actions against Chinese and the Philippine civilians. An added element in the Pacific war was the extreme hatred on both sides, reinforced by racist attitudes present in both cultures. The brutal isiand-hopping campaigns only deepened these feelings of hatred which, in turn, made it much easier to dehumanize the enemy. Racism soon became one of the central themes in the Pacific conflict. The internment of Japanese Americans in the U.S contributed to the process of dehumanization in America.
