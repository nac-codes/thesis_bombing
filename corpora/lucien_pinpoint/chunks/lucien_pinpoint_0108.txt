The common soldier viewed the enemy as subhuman, as able to endure unthinkable privation and inflict the sam e.1 2 2 These views were not confined to the lower ranks. General George Kenney wrote to Arnold that "the Jap is undoubtedly a low order of humanity, but is clever and knows how to fight. At home he can't indulge in his Mongol liking for looting, arson, massacre, and rape. In the army he can look forward to all four". The tendency to assign such characteristics to Asians was common among the American leadership. Arnold, Kenney, MacArthur, and LeMay were fully capable of realistic appraisal of the Japanese fighting capabilities, but their racist attitudes tended to cause them to believe that a higher degree of violence would be needed to defeat the Japanese. As Kenney continued, "he can probably take a death toll of ten million the last of them in the streets of Tokyo, before he quits. If we kill five for one we still have a death roll to face."1 2 3  The belief that Japan could "take a death toll" would suggest to the American high command that extraordinary and brutal methods would have to be used to defeat the Japanese. American leaders easily extrapolated the experiences American soldiers were having in the brutal island campaigns to the average women and children in the streets of Tokyo. If the common Japanese soldier fought to the death, then their women and children would do the same. In July 1945, during another fact-finding trip to the Pacific, Arnold became caught up in similar racist attitudes. During this trip, Arnold reacted to the destruction caused by the Japanese occupation of the Philippines as he had in Britain during the darkest days of 1942. Arnold became filled with a inner rage against the enemy. See,
