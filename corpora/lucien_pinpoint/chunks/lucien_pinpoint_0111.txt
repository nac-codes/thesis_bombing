Spaatz asked Goering directly if "the Germans realize that the American Air Forces by intention did only precision bombing?"1 2 8  Spaatz and many of his contemporaries wanted to maintain the myth of strategic bombing as it was conceived of in the 1930â€™s. Spaatz had faith in his organization and its capabilities. To openly admit, especially to a former enemy, that the AAF had frequently engaged in area bombing against noncombatants would have broken this credo. As often occurs in these types of situations, when one puts too much faith in machines and organizations that control them, the consequences for humanity become blurred.

The first section of the AAF's report covered  the effect of air attacks on the German war economy. The report noted that the war economy had not been fully mobilized until the first half of 1944. By this time, however, the German military situation was so precarious that desperate meas
