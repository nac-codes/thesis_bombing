war economy. The report noted that the war economy had not been fully mobilized until the first half of 1944. By this time, however, the German military situation was so precarious that desperate measures, such as the closing of all entertainment establishments and institutions of higher education, had to be taken. Moreover, by this juncture in the war, the bombing campaign was having a serious impact on Germany's manpower situation. The most common effect was the disruption of production due to alerts and air raids and the diversion of labor from production to clearance and reconstruction activities. By the end of 1943, the destruction of plants and cities made it necessary for the Nazis to redirect production, causing considerable strain on manpower, efficiency, and quality.1 2 9  An interesting case in point was the production of the ME 262 je t fighter. Due to allied bombing production of the je t had to be moved to the Black Forest. Under such conditions production was erratic and quality control was suspect. With the dispersal of production, larger enterprises had to rely even more on small contractors with 1 M .

Although the aircraft caused allied air leaders some sleepless nights, it was too little too late. Further complicating Germany's problems was the fact that strategic bombing had made the fuel situation alm ost impossible, not to mention that there were simply not enough trained pilots to operate the touchy new jets. The GAF assembled a group of expert pilots for the ME 262, but again they could not affect the outcome of the air w ar.1 3 1  But the principal effect
