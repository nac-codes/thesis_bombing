Supporters of these theories fully embraced the modern nature of American society, with its concept of interlocking industries, transportation, and electrical grids. To American planners, it made sense that if these vital domains were disrupted, their enemy's war-making capacity would collapse. Their training, professional expertise, and faith in technology led them to believe that they could micro manage a strategic bombing campaign. All they needed were the proper inputs (targets) and technological and manpower resources to meticulously plan the destruction of their enemy's war economy. When the war began, Arnold and his team  were eager to prove that their equipment and conception of air power could succed where the British had failed. They set for themselves ambitious but straightforward goals for their strategic campaigns against Germany and Japan. In their most optimistic appraisals of the situation, they hoped to achieve the collapse of the enemy's w ar-m aking capacity, thus making a traditional invasion unnecessary. Before they could accomplish this aim, however, they had to destroy the German and Japanese air forces. Such an accomplishment would vault them over the more traditional services and make the AAF the most prominent service in the military.
