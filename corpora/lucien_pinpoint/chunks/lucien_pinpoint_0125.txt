be held out to the public and to the rest of the military establishment. And again the limitations of this promise were just as apparent in the 1940's as in the 1990's, as most recently observed in the Kosova conflict. The contradiction between promise and reality often came out when innocent civilians were killed and their images were beamed around the world. This study is limited in scope in that the researcher does not fully address the political aspect of the strategic bombing campaign. Although I discuss the importance of Roosevelt's backing of strategic bombing, an expanded study is needed to detail the relationship between the administration, particularly Roosevelt's view of war, and the military's conception of strategic bombing. Furthermore, the study would benefit from the inclusion of Carl Spaatz's and Curtis LeMay's papers. Also, a more through examination of the implications of how technology influenced the institutional behavior of the Army Air Force would be beneficial.
