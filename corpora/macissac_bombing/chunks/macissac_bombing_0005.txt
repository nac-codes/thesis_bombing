and supply depots, and his centers of government. The Smuts Memorandum of 17 August 1917, the paper that led directly to the creation of the Royal Air Force, discussed air warfare in these terms:  As far as can at present be foreseen there is absolutely nolimitto + the scale of its future independent war use. And the day may not  be far off when aerial operations with their devastation of enemy lands and destruction of industrial and populous centres on a vast scale may become the principal operations of war, to which the older forms of military and naval operations may become secondary and subordinate.  Allthe Winds of Doctrine 5  Thus, assuming little or no opposition from enemy aircraft, three roles that aircraft might play in warfare were identified: Observation (or reconnaissance), Attack (in the sense of tactical ground support) and Strategic (or independent). The reality of an enemy also armed with aircraft produced still another role, that of a Pursuit (or fighter) capability whereby the enemy’s aircraft might be destroyed in the air.  In the decade following the war the pace of technological develop- ment slowed while theoretical speculation continued apace. In Great Britain the RAF, fighting for its institutional life, experimented with the concept of “‘air control” in which means were sought to apply military aircraft to the policing functions of the Empire. In the United States the Army’s Air Service, led on by the exploits of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell and the hopes and dreams of a few aircraft manufacturers, began its long battle to achieve institutional parity with the Army and Navy.!3 The apparently logical path to such an achievement lay in the direction of identifying, seizing upon, and exploiting a unique “‘role”’ or ‘‘mission’’ that air forces alone could apply in warfare. If that could be achieved, if a powerful case could be made for the efficacy of the ‘third dimension to warfare,” then a third service might well follow.  As time passed
