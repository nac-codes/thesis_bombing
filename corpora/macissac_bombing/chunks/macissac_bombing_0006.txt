alone could apply in warfare. If that could be achieved, if a powerful case could be made for the efficacy of the ‘third dimension to warfare,” then a third service might well follow.  As time passed some of the airmen, not unlike other visionaries, gave their own meaning to certain words; two of these, “strategic”’ and “independent,” require explanation. The general tendency that developed was to use these words to mean virtually the same thing, bombing operations conducted independently of surface forces whether on land or sea. When used in a technical sense, to be sure,  strategic bombing” was identified as that directed against the Sustaining resources of an enemy’s war capability. But from the begirining—and, indeed, ever since—critics have pointed out that bombing missions designed to assist the advance of surface forces have as much right to be called ‘‘strategic’’ as any other type of bombing operations. No easy solution to this semantic difficulty has appeared. The innovators among the airmen, convinced that they had Faker new way of waging war, needed to call it something and they sc he term “strategic bombing.” They might have called it  mething else, but to what purpose? fenrmeninight, for example, have chosen to distinguish between mr military bombing Gn support of the ground battle) and gic economic bombing.” Doing so, however, could only have  oe Ss  ory S  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 5 --- ) | Strategic Bombing in World War Two  }  educed the force of the argument in favor of “independent” »perations. The choices (if, indeed, they were so considered) lay etween strategic bombing, independent bombing, and economic bombing. What Samuel Huntington calls “the military ethic’’ would militate against any highlighting of the word “independent,” connoting as it does any number of notions not likely to win favor with the ‘‘military mind,” however defined; to have highlighted the word “economic” would have been to bring out in the open the essenti
