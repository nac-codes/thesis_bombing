noting as it does any number of notions not likely to win favor with the ‘‘military mind,” however defined; to have highlighted the word “economic” would have been to bring out in the open the essential conflict between the views of the airmen and those of the Army general staff, the latter holding as their ‘First Commandment” that the route to military victory lay in the defeat of the enemy armed forces in battle. Finally, by calling it “strategic” bombing the airmen implied that the provision for such operations was entitled to a place of its own in the formulation of basic war strategy.  Hence, strategic bombing (or bombardment) became the term commonly applied by airmen to designate long-range bombing operations. Under this generous mantle they would later find it possible to include many types of missions, including those flown in direct support of ground armies. But for the period between the wars, the chosen term served the important purpose of suggesting the gains that might be achieved by long-range operations conducted inde- pendently of the ground battle. In this way, with perseverance and luck, a persuasive case might be made for placing the control and direction of such operations outside existing service parameters. There can be no gainsaying, as well, that those who believed a new element had been added to warfare were also convinced, and with good reason, that this element could be developed best in an atmos- phere untrammeled by devotion: to traditions and command arrangements dating back at least to the nineteenth century.  It would be wrong, however, to conclude that the drive toward institutional autonomy was the only, or necessarily the primary, driving force behind the vision of Mitchell and his followers. On the contrary, the principal emotional stimulus was a sincere, if largely intuitive, conviction that the “warfare of the past” was just that—that the warfare of the future would be dominated from the air. Accepting this as given, those in a
