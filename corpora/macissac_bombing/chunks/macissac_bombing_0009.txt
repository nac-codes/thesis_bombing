With the addition of a means, the B-17, to a goal, independent operations, there remained to be worked out a precise.‘‘theory of employment” by which the goal might be attained. As frequently happens in an era of rapid technological change, both the innovators and the apparent trend in technology emphasized the need to concentrate on offensive capabilities.  By 1939 a theory of employment had been derived.!7 In brief it may be described as follows: the most efficient way to defeat an enemy is to destroy,’ by means of bombardment from the air, his war-making capacity; the means to this end is to identify by scientific analysis those particular elements of his war potential the elimination of which will cripple either his war machine or his will to continue the conflict; these elements having been identified, they should be attacked by large masses of bombardment aircraft flying in formation, at high altitude, in daylight, and equipped with precision bombsights that will make possible the positive identification and destruction of “pin- point” targets; finally, such bombing missions having been carried out. the enemy, regardless of his strength in armies and navies, will ack the means to support continued military action.

Yet while the complexity of its evolution may befuddle the most earnest researcher, some of the highlights, at least, must be mentioned.  Building upon the experience of World War I, the Italian General Giulio Douhet published his Command of the Air in 1921.19 Unlike Mitchell, whose aim was to stimulate the development of all aspects of the milita
