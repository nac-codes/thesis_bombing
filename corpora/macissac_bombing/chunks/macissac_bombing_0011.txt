hether it might be possible, through careful, scientific study of a nation’s industry, to single out particular targets whose destruction would of itself bring to a halt an entire industry or series of industries. If a number of such targets could be identified and destroyed, it might just be possible, with a relatively small force, to bring an enemy’s war production to a ~ halt with almost surgical precision. Accordingly informal studies were set in motion, using the United States as a test case, to determine the  Allthe Winds of Doctrine 9  degree of industrial concentration, the component parts of various industries, the relative importance of each of the parts, and the vul- nerability_to air attack of what appeared to be the most critical elements.  Identifying targets was one thing; hitting them from the air was something else. Yet technology, at least for the optimists, seemed to be keeping pace. The B-17 had range, speed, altitude, and bomb-carrying capacity that was considered equal to the task.23 And when orders were placed for improved models of the Sperry bomb- sight and for the new Norden Mark XV bombsight (both in 1933), it appeared likely that the day might not be far off when a fleet of perhaps one hundred B-17s could take off from some friendly base (perhaps in England), fly at high altitudes (perhaps 25,000 feet, the purpose being to get above enemy antiaircraft guns and defensive fighters) for several hundred miles, and arrive over a carefully chosen enemy target. There, grouped together in a large formation (to multiply both the amount of force delivered on the target and the defensive firepower, if needed, of the bombers’ guns), they would carefully “sight in” the target (with the new bombsights), trigger their bomb loads, and then return several hundred miles to their base. Behind them they would leave a badly crippled, if not devastated industry (actually only one factory, perhaps, but so chosen that its destruction must inevitably cripple an e
