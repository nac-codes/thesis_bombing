This decision reflected the growing concern of the CCS over the outcome of the Battle of the Atlantic as well as a desire to offer additional protec- tion for the shipping requirements needed to support the November landings in North Africa (Operation TORCH). Soon thereafter the two most proficient Bomb Groups of the Eighth Air Force were despatched to North Africa to support the surface operations aimed at dislodging Rommel from that continent.
