During the first half of 1943, the Eighth Air Force concentrated on the anti-submarine campaign,”* its remaining efforts during the period appearing, in the words of the official history, ‘‘tentative, scattered, and light.’’ The logistical and personnel build-up contin- ued to be slower than hoped for, so much so that ‘“‘combat crews saw in the statistics of attrition and replacement the likely prospect of a short career.”35 A few tentative raids were made into Germany, but these became increasingly expensive as the opposition increased, German air strength in the west being augmented by units moved to France and northern Germany from the Mediterranean and Russian fronts. As the numbers of German defensive aircraft increased so also did the skill of their pilots, and the early hopes that the B-17s and B-24s could operate beyond the range of fighter escort began severely to be questioned.  Growing concern over the German Air Force was reflected in the Combined Bomber Offensive Plan (C.B.O.

Based on the most thorough analysis yet made of vul- nerable targets in Germany, it identified six systems comprising seventy-six precision targets. The six systems were: (1) submarine construction yards and bases,2 (2) the German aircraft industry, (3) ball bearing manufacture,29 (4) oil production, (5) synthetic rubber and tires, and 6) military transport vehicle production. However, while these six systems were listed as the “‘principal objectives,” one Overriding “intermediate objective” was stipulated; this was the German Air Force, particularly its fighter strength.  lf the growth of the German fighter streng
