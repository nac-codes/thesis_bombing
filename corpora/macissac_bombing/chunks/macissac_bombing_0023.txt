ned United States Strategic Air Forces (USSTAF), was made responsible for the overall direction of the American strate- gic air effort in Europe. While these changes were taking place the bomber force, in effect, stood down, waiting for the weather to break and for the arrival in mass of the long-awaited long range escort fighters. During this same period, RAF Bomber Command launched its ill-fated night bombing offensive against Berlin,43 an offensive in which the loss rates paralleled those of the Americans in the months  leading up to October 1943. As 1943 turned into 1944 it had become:  abundantly clear that success over the Luftwaffe in the battle of the air was the necessary prerequisite for the success of any bombing offensive, however conceived and executed. For the Allied bombing effort, the moment of crisis had arrived.  Despite the assumptions of the Air Corps Tactical School in the thirties that long range escort was probably not feasible, the authors of AWPD-1 had urged its development as at least an insurance factor. And although work was intensified on the problem at Wright Field (Dayton, Ohio) in 1942, it was late in 1943 before such aircraft began to arrive in England.44 The eventual answer to the problem was the P-S1 “Mustang,” but improvements on the P-47 “Thunderbolt” late in 1943—essentially the addition of jettisonable fuel tanks—gave promise of greatly increased range. When first employed, however the effectiveness of the new escort fighters was hampered by the tactical decision that they should do exactly what their name implied; that is, they were to escort, convoy one might say, the bombers to the target, operating offensively only to drive off attacking enemy air- “aca This pleased the harried bomber pilots no end—the sight of eeniily fighters flying alongside over enemy territory was an Meroe novelty—but it frustrated the fighter pilots.
