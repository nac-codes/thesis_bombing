While the Bibliography describes in detail the various manuscript collections and the Glossary below explains abbreviations used in the text, a few sample citations will help to illustrate the peculiarities of usage adopted herein.  The citation NA, 243, 1, 36, 300.6-F means, at length, National Archives, Record Group 243 (files of the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey), Entry 1 of the Record Group (Administrative Correspond- ence, Office of the Chairman), Box 36 within Entry 1, and the folder within that box numbered 300.6-F. Thus, when citing a letter from Franklin D’Olier to Paul Nitze, the format used is as follows: ‘‘Ltr, 24Dec44, D’Olier to Nitze, NA, 243, 1, 66, 322.”  Another principal source was the contemporary history compiled during the course of the Survey activities by Major James Beveridge. Volumes 2 and 4 of his unpublished typescript are ‘Volumes of Appendices” to the narrative volumes covering Europe (Vol. 1) and Japan (Vol. 3). Since the pages of Volumes 2 and 4 are not numbered, references are given to ‘frame numbers”’ and correspond to the microfilm copy of the history available from the Office of the Chief of Military History, U.S. Army.
