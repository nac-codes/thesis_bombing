r, was an obvious prerequisite to understanding and interpreting its published reports. Put briefly, the problem that came to hold my interest was simply this: if, as already seems to be the case, the reports of the Survey are to become the Domesday Book of the strategic bombing campaigns of World War II, then the time has come to examine, in the case of the Survey, the very questions that have plagued Domesday Book interpreters for almost nine hundred years.  My initial goal was appropriately humble: to compile, along historical lines, a ‘Guidebook to the Strategic Bombing Survey.” If successful, the result could prove a valuable tool for historians using the published reports. In progressing, however, it soon became apparent that the Survey could hardly be explained in a vacuum; not only how its members measured but whaz it was they were measuring had to be explained. It was in seeking to answer the second question that the narrative took on two additional, but subordinate, themes: the rise and decline of the theory of high altitude precision bombard- ment of carefully selected targets; and the degree to which the Survey’s deliberations were affected by inter-service wrangling over the question of which of the armed services deserved the lion’s share of the credit for winning the war. Hopefully, the interweaving of these three themes will provide some measure of enduring value to what might otherwise have remained a straightforward example of administrative history.  My obligations are many: to Theodore Ropp of Duke University, whose energetic self-restraint in the early stages of this undertaking leaves me awed even unto the present; to Colonel (USAF) Alfred F. Hurley, who never doubted; to archivists and librarians and former members of the Strategic Bombing Survey who were as patient as they were helpful; and to my colleagues at the Air Force Academy, both officers and cadets, who were willing to listen. I have a particular indebtedness to the following individ
