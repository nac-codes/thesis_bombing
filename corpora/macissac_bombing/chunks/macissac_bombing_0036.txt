ort of mobile artillery, applied directly in support of ground armies. By war's end, spurred on largely by the German example, a third vision arose—that of an air force operating independently of armies and navies. The task of such a force would be to attack the enemy at places far removed from the battle lines, the purpose being to destroy essential elements of the enemy’s war capability by bombing his factories, his transportation  and supply depots, and his centers of government. The Smuts Memorandum of 17 August 1917, the paper that led directly to the creation of the Royal Air Force, discussed air warfare in these terms:  As far as can at present be foreseen there is absolutely no limit to the scale of its future independent war use. And the day may not be far off when aerial operations with their devastation of enemy lands and destruction of industrial and populous centres on a vast scale may become the principal operations of war, to which the older forms of military and naval operations may become secondary and subordinate.  All the Winds of Doctrine 5  Thus, assuming little or no opposition from enemy aircraft, three roles that aircraft might play in wartare were identified: Observation (or reconnaissance), Attack (in the sense of tactical ground support), and Strategic (or independent). The reality of an enemy also armed with aircraft produced still another role, that of a Pursuit (or fighter) cone lity whereby the enemy’s aircraft might be destroyed in the air.  In the decade following the war the pace of technological develop- ment slowed while theoretical speculation continued apace. In Great Britain the RAF, fighting for its institutional life, experimented with the concept of “air control” in which means were sought to apply military aircraft to the policing functions of the Empire. In the United States the Army’s Air Service, led on by the exploits of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell and the hopes and dreams of a few aircraft manufacturers, began its
