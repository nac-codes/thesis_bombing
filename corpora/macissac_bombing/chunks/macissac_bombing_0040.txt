simply that the strategic role offered the best possibilities for an independent mission; also relevant, and perhaps equally so, was the trend of technological advance in air- craft. With the appearance of the B-9 and B-10 in the early thirties and with the first flight of the experimental B-17 in July 1935, the means to apply what had hitherto been only a theory seemed at hand. And reinforcing the dreams of the strategic air theorists was the then apparent impossibility of building a pursuit aircraft!© that could match in speed, range, or altitude the multi-engined bomber. With the addition of a means, the B-17, to a goal, independent operations there remained to be worked out a precise ‘theory of employment” by which the goal might be attained. As frequently happens in an era of rapid technological change, both the innovators and the apparent trend in technology emphasized the need to concentrate on offensive capabilities. :  By 1939 a theory of employment had been derived. ! 7 In brief it may be described as follows: the most efficient way to defeat an enemy is to destroy, by means of bombardment from the air, his war-making capacity; the means to this end is to identify by scientific analysis those particular elements of his war potential the elimination of which will cripple either his war machine or his will to continue the conflict; these elements having been identified, they should be attacked by large masses of bombardment aircraft flying in formation, at high altitude, in daylight, and equipped with precision bombsights that will make possible the positive identification and destruction of ‘‘pin- point” targets; finally, such bombing missions having been carried out, the enemy, regardless of his strength in armies and navies, will lack the means to support continued military action.
