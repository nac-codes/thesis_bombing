Yet while the complexity of its evolution may befuddle the most earnest researcher, some of the highlights, at least, must be mentioned.!  Building upon the experience of World War I, the Italian General Giulio Douhet published his Command of the Air in 1921.19 Unlike Mitchell, whose aim was to stimulate the development of all aspects of the military air potential, Douhet set his sights squarely on the strategic role of bombardment aircraft. In briefest compass, his view of future strategy was that a nation should resist on the ground while it massed for an offensive in the air. While recognizing the importance of target selection, Douhet nonetheless devoted few lines to this crucial question, owing probably to his inherent assumption that both incendiary bombs and others containing poison gas would comple- ment the effects of high explosive weapons. For Douhet, all aircraft types other than bombers were ancillary, nice to have in certain circumstances, perhaps, but of a distinctly lower order of importance. Victory would be brought about by masses of heavy bombers destroy- ing the enemy air force on the ground and continuing on to devastate his cities and industries.  The degree to which Douhetâ€™s theories influenced the instructors at the Air Corps Tactical School is, and seems destined to remain, a matter of conjecture. But it is known that an English translation of his book was available there as early as 1923.20 When one compares the fully-developed American theory of the late thirties with that of Douhet, however, it appears certain that whatever influence he had was inspirational more than anything else.21 What clearly distin- guishes the theory evolved at the Tactical School was
