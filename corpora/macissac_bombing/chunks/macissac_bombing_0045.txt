The fledgling Army Air Corps, still looked upon by the War Department General Staff (WDGS) as a vexing, presumptuous stepchild overly fond of going outside the family for sympathy and assistance, soon found that it had important friends in  i laces. ni thetbes they intended it or not, the two men who did most to assure a significant role for air forces in the approaching war were President Franklin D. Roosevelt and General George C. Marshall, the Army chief of staff.25 Working closely with both of them was  AP AERP ETE AE, TS  Allthe Winds of Doctrine 11  Lieutenant General H.

In a special message to Congress in January 1939 he decried the state of our “utterly inadequate” air forces and begged further expenditures from a reluctant Congress. Until well into the war the President continued to set “impossible” goals for aircraft production, raising his sights from 10,000 planes a year to 50,000 and finally to 100,000. To be sure, “FDR and Marshall did not just pull these numbers out of the air. Arnold played a major role in setting these goals and probably had an indirect inspirational role with FDR as well as coming up with figures when appropriate.” 26  The forced expansion of the aircraft industry served many purposes. In the first place, Great Britain was already engaged in an air war with Germany and the most immediate assistance the U.S. could render was in the form of equipment (aircraft, ships, etc.) rather than mén.27 In the second place, a fleet of bombers stationed in England might provide a capability, should war, in fact, come, of striking quickly at Germany.
