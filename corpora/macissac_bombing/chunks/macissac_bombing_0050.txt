Soon thereafter the two most proficient Bomb Groups of the Eighth Air Force were despatched to North Africa to support the surface operations aimed at dislodging Rommel from that continent. And back in Washington General Arnold was soon engaged in a battle of his own, this one with the Navy which sought to divert a larger share of heavy bomber production to the war in the Pacific (where, to the utter dismay of the airmen, the aircraft would be used primarily for long-range patrol and reconnaissance).  In January 1943 the Combined Chiefs of Staff met at Casablanca to determine an overall strategy for the defeat of Germany. Among the decisions confirmed at that conference was that an invasion of the western European continent could not be launched in force until at least the spring of 1944. At the same time it was determined that in order to prepare the way for such an invasion, the Eighth Air Force and the RAF should launch a sustained bomber offensive from bases in the United Kingdom. The ultimate objective of that offensive was stated to be “the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial, and economic system, and the under- mining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened. This is construed as  *“Diversions,”’ like “strategic” as applied to bombing, is a potentially loaded word. In these pages it is used in the same sense that the bomber commanders used it during the war, i.e., to denote any sort of bombing mission directed by higher authority that had the effect of diverting part of the strategic bomber force from the primary target systems that the bomber commanders considered most profitable. Confounding the problem was a lack of agreement among the bomber commanders; what was a “primary objective” to General Spaatz was more often than n
