efore such aircraft began to arrive in England.44 The eventual answer to the problem was the P-S1 “Mustang,” but improvements on the P-47 “Thunderbolt” late in 1943—essentially the addition of jettisonable fuel tanks—gave promise of greatly increased range. When first employed, however the effectiveness of the new escort fighters was hampered by the tactical decision that they should do exactly what their name implied; that is, they were to escort, convoy one might say, the bombers to the target, operating offensively only to drive off attacking enemy air- craft. This pleased the harried bomber pilots no end—the sight of friendly fighters flying alongside over enemy territory was an agreeable novelty—but it frustrated the fighter pilots. They argued that they could be far more effective if most of them were allowed to break loose from the bomber formations and go over to the attack the instant that enemy fighters were sighted in any quadrant—indeed, if a fair proportion of them were allowed to precede the bomber forma- tions in a coordinated series of fighter sweeps. As events were to show,  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 28 --- 18 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  the fighter pilots were correct, and before the next large-scale bombing efforts were launched_into Germany they were given the freedom they had long sought.45 General Spaatz had determined to force the battle in the air; that decision spelt the death knell of the uftwajfe. 7 vat Sing last,” says the official history, on 19 February 1944 the weather opened up over Germany and a concerted attack against the German aircraft industry was launched. Running daily through 25 February, the series of attacks involved over 3,300 bombers of the Eighth and more than S00 of the Fifteenth. Almost 10,000 tons of bombs were dropped, a scale of attack roughly equal to that of the Eighth Air Force during its entire first year of operations.” Enor- mously encouraged by the success of “Big Week, the air com- mand
