bombs were dropped, a scale of attack roughly equal to that of the Eighth Air Force during its entire first year of operations.” Enor- mously encouraged by the success of “Big Week, the air com- manders could finally begin to hope that after all their trials and setbacks they had at last attained both the means and the technique to destroy from the air Germany's ability to carry on the war. But the weather over the target areas closed in again for a month, and when it cleared the control of the strategic air forces had passed to General Eisenhower, Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Forces. The planning for the assault on Normandy (Operation OVER- LORD) dated back to the Casablanca Conference in January 1943. A part of this planning had always been the assumption that air forces would be employed in direct support of the landings. But in the early months of 1944 serious disagreements arose as to how best to provide air support to OVERLORD. Everyone (soldiers, sailors, airmen) agreed that the overriding goal of air operations was Allied air supremacy over the beachhead on D-Day and as long thereafter as necessary. Eisenhower's deputy (Air Chief Marshal Tedder), all the senior ground commanders, the commander-in-chief, Allied Expedi- tionary Air Forces (Air Chief Marshal Leigh-Mallory), and most—but not all—of the RAF staff insisted that the best way to bring this about would be for the air forces, beginning as early as 1 March 1944, progressively to destroy the railway network of northern France and the Low Countries. The idea was to create a “railway desert’’ that would prevent the enemy from moving his reserves into the assault area and generally from shifting troops and supplies behind his own lines. The targets would be marshalling yards, locomotive repair facilities, bridges, etc. Two important airmen, less well instructed in the strategical reason for the inability of the Allied Powers to pene- trate the German lines between 1915 and 1917, did not agree.
