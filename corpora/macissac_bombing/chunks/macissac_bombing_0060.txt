d, had evolved within the Army Air Forces. In its original form the idea was not at all unlike the normal military practice of conducting in-house ap- praisals of military operations, be they mock maneuvers in peacetime or combat operations in wartime. What was to distinguish the Strategic Bombing Survey from such customary “‘after action reports” was its evolution into a Presidential Commission possessed of extraordinary powers and directed by civilians rather than soldiers.!  The original problem pointing up the need for some sort of inspection or evaluation of the bombing offensive was the awareness on the part of AAF planners that the enterprise in which they were about to engage was wholly new and without precedent, if not in a conceptual sense then certainly with respect to the scope and intensity of the planned campaign. Coupled with this awareness was another, rather more specific: the information available to guide the planners in the selection of target systems was utterly inadequate. Accordingly, from the very beginning of operations some means would have to be found to measure both the results achieved and the assumptions upon which plans had been drawn up. Unlike the ground soldiers, the air strategists would not be able to measure their effectiveness in terms of ground gained or lost; some other means would have to be found and it would have to be applied early if the fully developed campaign were to be based on more than theory existing in a bigamous relationship with untested assump- tions and questionable analogies between discrete economic systems.  Once the expansion of the AAF had been set in motion and tentative approval given to the basic concept of waging a strategic bombing offensive, the major difficulty to be surmounted was that of determining upon some valid method for selecting targets. At the heart of the whole theory devised at the Air Corps Tactical School lay the assumption that within any national economic system there were certain c
