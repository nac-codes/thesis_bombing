back as the spring of 1940 its organizational predecessor—the Intelligence Section of the Air Corps Information Division—had begun to compile “‘air intelligence” relating to the industrial structures of Germany, Italy, and Japan. From the very beginning ingenuity was the order of the-day and among the “many devious channels through which this search led” were the vaults of certain New York banks where detail drawings of many German factories were found.

Chief among these was the virtual absence from the staff of the Target Section of officers trained to interpret the information being accumulated. The man who not only recognized this difficulty but also set about resolving it was Major General Muir S. Fairchild, and it is for this reason among others that will appear later that he can
