Intelligence, with its Target Information Section, needed information about results as a check on the data it was continuing to collect; Plans, with its responsibility for future operations, wanted to be assured that its recommendations for the future took into account the actual results of past operations. Complicating this minor squabble was the personal interest of the AC/AS, Plans, Major General Laurence S. Kuter, a former colleague of General Fairchild on the faculty at ACTS, a major contributor to the theory of strategic bombing, and one of the authors of AWPD-1.!7 Upon the insistence of (now) Brigadier General Sorenson that the matter of evaluation was properly a responsibility of Intelligence, General Kuter let the matter drop temporarily, although he continued occasionally to call on Colonel Perera and other members of the COA for reports.!

The problem had become less that of what targets to strike and more that of whether the means would be found to strike any in the context of acceptable air-to-air losses. But no sooner had optimism returned after “Big Week” than the question of evaluation was revived, exacerbated now in the minds of many by the question of how the bombers would be employed to support the coming assault on Festung Europa.
