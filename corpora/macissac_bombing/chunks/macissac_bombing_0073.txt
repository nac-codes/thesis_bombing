included the British Air Ministry, the Economic Objectives Unit of the Economic Warfare Division in the U.S. Embassy (EOU/EWD),3 the London field office of OSRD,4 and the joint British-American bomb damage analysis project located at Princes Risborough and known as “R. E. 8.”5 As a result of these conferences two things became evident: first, that an immense research task would be required before any survey teams could be sent into the field; second, that the other agencies, both British and American, had interests of their own that such a survey might serve.  There was much to be done to prepare for any such survey. For example, if the committee were to evaluate the bombing missions, then it would certainly need to know in advance what missions had been flown, when, against what targets, against what kinds of German opposition, in what weather conditions, with what types of bombs and fuzings, and with what apparent effect. The answers to all such questions could be found, to be sure, but not in one place and not in the format that the committee might want. Then lists would have to be drawn up of targets to be inspected by ground teams, German government agencies whose records the committee would need, and persons in Germany to be interrogated.  Since it was initially assumed, ‘‘for planning purposes,” that the survey would cover all aspects of the bombing offensive, almost anything that anyone could think of, in any way relating to the offensive, would be surveyed—physical destruction caused by bombs, criteria applied to select targets, effects of bombing on decisions taken by the German high command, effects of bombing on the morale of enemy troops and enemy workers, production setbacks attributable to bombing, ad infinitum. For this reason, and especially because it began to appear that the proposed committee would want to sequester virtually all German official documents that became available, the various agencies contacted for suggestions began to consider whet
