Colonel Ames began his series of impromptu conferences, the general idea advanced by the British being, “Why shouldn't a ‘combined’ bomber offensive be the subject of a combined survey?” In talking with Ames and later General Cabell, RAF officers pointed out that the British had been working on the problem of bomb damage assessment ever since the first German raids against England in 1940, that within their Ministry of Home Security and their special project (R. E. 8) out at Princes Risborough were a considerable number of people with several years experience at the task. But crucial to the question of cooperation on this matter were the differences in targeting theory that had come to mark the British and American approaches.  Starting out in 1940 with a theory of precision bombing remarkably similar to that evolved at ACTS, the RAF had found by cruel experience that unescorted day bombardment resulted in losses well above the level that could be absorbed. While switching over to night bombardment reduced losses, it also reduced accuracy, and so by 1942 the RAF Bomber Command had reached the point where it was flying night missions directed against target “areas”  An Idea in Search of Definition 35  with the avowed aim of destroying not so much particular factories as the supporting elements around important factories—in short, the homes of the factory workers.!1 When the Americans joined the bomber offensive in 1942, their British counterparts tried strenuous- ly, if vainly, to convince them that the theory they brought with them would not work. But it took Schweinfurt to convince the Americans, and by the time they resumed the offensive in force in February of 1944 the problem of long-range escort had been solved. So the question had, in a way, become moot, but it had left some hard feelings behind, feelings that could only exacerbate the natural spirit of competition that could be presumed to exist between the RAF and USSTAF. And making matters worse for the id
