ailed, and the British Bombing Survey Unit (the eventual British equivalent of USSBS) still an uncertainty, Sir Charles contemplated the unhappy prospect of the USSBS findings becoming the sole record for the future.  I should regard this as most unsatisfactory. American bombing methods have differed from our own. It is therefore only to be expected that the American report would concentrate upon those results for which the Americans have been mainly responsible and in which they would quite naturally be most interested. On the other hand, it would almost certainly ignore or obscure some of the results of Bomber Command’s opera- tions of which I consider it essential to ascertain the importance. Moreover, there would be a danger that a rather incomplete picture would be given to the world of results of an offensive in which a large proportion of British resources had been employed in this war.!6  And finally, though not mentioned to the British but stressed time and again by Spaatz and others writing back to Washington, there was the American feeling that a combined survey would involve unconscionable delay.!7 In the American jargon the fear was that the British would “‘committee the thing to death,’’ and hence that the findings of the survey would not be available in time to be  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 38 --- 38 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  applied against Japan.

When General Spaatz’s original letter of S April arrived in General Arnold’s office in Washington, the commanding general had turned the matter over to General Kuter, AC/AS, Plans. Kuter began by returning the Major Colbert/General White proposal of 30 March, advising them si
