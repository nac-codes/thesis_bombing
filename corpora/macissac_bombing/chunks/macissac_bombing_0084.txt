For several months thereafter, his attention taken up by other matters, General Arnold assumed that all was going well. Yet it is to London rather than to AAF Headquarters that one must look to find the initiatives that finally got the project off the ground.  Activities in London during June have already been alluded to. Essentially they consisted of General Cabell’s continued sparring with the RAF on the question of cooperation and Colonel Ames’s initial attempts to devise a “skeleton” organization for the survey. Attached to one of General Spaatz’s early letters to General Arnold had been two charts, one suggesting precise manning requirements for the immediate planning stages,°¥ the other showing the tentative arrangement of the fully organized survey. These charts were similar in structure; the latter, called ‘‘Chart A,” is reproduced in Figure 1 on the following page.
