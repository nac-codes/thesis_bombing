EWD, and OSRD. Most of July and August were taken up with these problems.  While Colonel Koenig was doing his best to recruit survey members in London, the matter of finding a civilian chairman was not going well in Washington. The Air Staff's first choice had been Dr. Conant3/ of Harvard University and the NDRC, but Vannevar Bush, OSRD director, had refused to consider letting Conant go. In Conant’s place he recommended Dr. John E.

The matter of a bombing survey first came to the attention of Mr. Lovett in August when Vannevar Bush, having recommended John Burchard, advised General Arnold that he would have to withdraw the nomination. Arnold then called on Lovett, explained the background of the survey idea,
