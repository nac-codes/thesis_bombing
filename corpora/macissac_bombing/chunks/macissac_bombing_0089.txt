when Vannevar Bush, having recommended John Burchard, advised General Arnold that he would have to withdraw the nomination. Arnold then called on Lovett, explained the background of the survey idea, and asked if the assistant secretary, a skilled negotiator well-connected in the banking and_ business worlds, would undertake the business of finding a chairman and obtaining Presidential approval for the project.  Lovett, formerly a partner of Brown Brothers, Harriman and Company of New York, had been recruited by Secretary of War Stimson in December of 1940, first as a special assistant and after April 1941 as Assistant Secretary of War for Air.
