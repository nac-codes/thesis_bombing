Morale, Economic, and Military Effects)** supported by an Administrative and Services section, Koenig’s report described the functions each would perform. He proposed that these divisions should operate from several sites: (1) a Research Headquarters in London to which findings would flow from four regional Head- quarters on the Continent (one in France and one each in the U.S., British, and French occupation zones in Germany); (2) a Field Team Headquarters outside London where the investigating teams would be billeted and from which they could be flown directly to their objectives; and (3) an office in Washington where the final reports would be written.  The main thrust of the survey’s effort, as Koenig envisaged it, should be to concentrate on the physical damage effects and the immediate economic effects of bombing, since these seemed to be  An Idea in Search of Definition 47  the two aspects of most potential use in the war against Japan. Accordingly, basing his requirements on a list of eighty-three plants, four “‘city areas,” and thirteen government ministries and military headquarters to be inspected, his report asked for sixty-three Economic Field Teams and twenty-five Physical Damage Teams. After adding spaces to cover administrative support, his proposed manning table added up to 1,579 spaces: 568 officers, 129 civilian specialists, and 882 enlisted men.  Knowing full well that these manpower requirements would be seriously questioned in Washington, Koenig was careful to explain the rationale behind the figures:  ‘Throughout the whole planning for the Survey, emphasis has been laid on a three months post-hostilities period for the collection of data. ... This emphasis has been [based on] the necessity of obtaining and analyzing material for the Japanese conflict . .. and on some field experience [showing] that it is far better to concentrate a large number of teams and collect the data while the damage factors are still unreconstructed, rather than use a
