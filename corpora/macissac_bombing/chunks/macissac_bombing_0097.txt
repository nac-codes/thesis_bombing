Pentagon on the morning of Saturday, 21 October, the two: of them were met by both the commanding general and Assistant Secretary Robert A. Lovett. Sensing at once that Mr. D’Olier seemed pleased at being called in to such high councils, General Arnold—as always—assumed the initiative.  “Colonel D’Olier, | have a job for you, a tough one, as tough as any I’ve ever pinned on anybody. Bob and I have talked it over and we agree that you are the man for that job. Put simply, what we want is for you and a group of your own choosing to go over to Europe and conduct a full-scale evaluation of the effects of our strategic bomb- ing against Germany.”  When Mr. D’Olier suggested that his background hardly seemed to fit him for the proposed task, Arnold assured him that that was  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 45 --- 52 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  just the point—that what they wanted was a nationally prominent man of affairs with no axes to grind, pro or con.  “Well, I'd surely need a lot of help,” D’Olier interjected. “Who would be my associates in such an undertaking?”  “We'll get you anyone you want,” Arnold replied.  His interest piqued, D’Olier asked for more details on the back- ground of the project. In the ensuing discussion Arnold and Lovett explained that their long-range goal was to obtain an impartial report, untainted by preconception or bias, that could be used as a basis for planning the postwar composition and strategical prin- ciples of the Army Air Forces. Such a report, they pointed out, should not only be written so that it would be meaningful to the man in the street, but should also be of such calibre as to withstand the scrutiny of Congress and other interested parties. At shorter range, Arnold explained, it would be helpful to have such a report at hand to guide those planning the air campaign against Japan. For this latter rea- son, the activities of the Survey group would have to remain ‘‘Top Secret”’ until final victory was assured.
