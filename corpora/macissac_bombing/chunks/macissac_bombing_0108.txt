of devising the approach to the economic investigation. While several tentative approaches had been tried, the results to date had been disappointing, owing in part to personality problems between Koenig and Colbert on the one hand and Mr. Irwin Nat Pincus of EWD on the other.23 The root of these difficulties lay in the desire of Koenigâ€™s staff to recruit members of the EWD staff for permanent assignment to the Survey, whereas the position of Mr. Pincus was that EWD, as time permitted, would assist the Survey while maintaining unscathed its own institutional existence.  The biggest problem, however, was simply that there were no general grounds for agreement on how to weigh the effects of bomb- ing on the German economy. Accordingly, most of the effort expended thus far had been in the direction of compiling Target Folders for a selected list of targets that it could be fairly certain would be investigated, e.g., the ball-bearing plants at Schweinfurt. These Target Folders, for use by the Field Teams, would contain every available scrap of information about the particular target: when attacked, by what organization, with how many aircraft, with what weight, type, and fuzings of bombs; to what apparent effect at the time (as judged by post-strike photography and other sources of intelligence); in what weather conditions, against what degree and type (aircraft, flak, smoke screens) of enemy opposition; and so forth. In addition, the folders would contain standardized question- naires and checklists designed with the hope of assuring that Field Team members collected comparable data at all targets they visited.  On the larger question, that of measuring overall economic effects, a few hardy souls both in EWD and within the Survey had proposed theoretical models outlining a number of ways to approach the problem. Progress toward agreement was dreadfully slow, how- ever, the efforts of the academicians being too theoretical for the tastes of the officers and those of th
