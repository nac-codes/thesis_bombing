a number of ways to approach the problem. Progress toward agreement was dreadfully slow, how- ever, the efforts of the academicians being too theoretical for the tastes of the officers and those of the officers reflecting intuitive shortcuts anathema to the academicians. No matter which way one  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 49 --- 60 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  turned there seemed no easy answer. If one devised a model of what German production would have been without bombing and then compared actual production with the total provided by the abstract model, how could one be sure that bombing alone caused the differ- ence? If a particular plant had been suffering from a shortage of labor, power, and raw materials, and then came under a bombing attack, who could be certain which factor was responsible for an ensuing production loss? These and similar questions were to plague the Survey members throughout their investigation. For the mo- ment, however, the directors remained optimistic.  As Mr. D’Olier’s main concern on this trip was more getting to know the people involved than the technical problems of the task, he at once set about making arrangements for a series of meetings. On Wednesday, 8 November, he, Alexander, Perera, and Koenig attended a conference at WIDEWING (Hq, USSTAF, REAR) with General F. L. Anderson and his staff.24 Two days later the same group plus Ball and Nitze met with Mr. Pincus at EWD.25 Over the weekend, Mr. D’Olier met with Major General Jacob E. Fickel, president of the AAF Evaluation Board for the ETO, and the two worked up a joint memorandum spelling out the jurisdiction of each group. Agreeing that it was impractical to divide responsibility according to the nature of the target—that is, whether tactical or strategic, since the heavy bombers had flown both types of mis- sions—D’Olier and Fickel made their essential division along geo- graphical lines: (1) the Survey would operate alone in Germany proper; (2) in France
