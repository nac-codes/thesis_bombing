strength in military personnel rose in steadily increasing increments from 621 on 1 February to 1,411 by 1 August.90 As the space available at 20 Grosvenor Square was utterly incapable of absorbing such numbers, Lieutenant Colonel William Strickland>! took the lead in a successful search for adequate working and billeting facilities. These were located in the RAF cantonment at Bushy Park near Kingston-upon-Thames, about eighteen miles southwest of London. During the first week of February the great majority of the military personnel were relocated there, much to the chagrin of those who had come to enjoy the inducements of London’s wartime night life.  At Bushy Park was established the Services Division under the command of General Sorenson. This Division, to which the majority of sane: personnel were assigned, was organized in four main branches>3 and became the work horse behind the scenes for the Survey’s other Divisions. Whatever the problem, from airlift requirements to typewriter repair, some section or branch of the Services Division was responsible. No history of the Survey would be complete without acknowledgment of the yeoman service of its officers and NCOs.94  y The organizational structure of the Survey as a whole underwent  * continuous revision. The basic change from that envisaged by the early planners was the move away from a horizontal structure of  / three or four co-equal parts to a vertical structure of numerous  | Divisions, each operating independently under the general supervi- | sion of the executive committee of directors. This transition was \ administered by Alexander and Nitze during January and February.  They began by breaking up the Economic Section (Figure 1) into a number of skeleton Divisions, eventually totalling seven (Figure 2); these Divisions they placed under the general category of ‘‘Economic Studies.’’ The real problem, however, was finding the people to man  |, these Divisions and to plan their eventual work in the field.
