gton, however, the gradually increasing importance of the economic investigation became apparent. This was due in part to the decision to arrange the investigation along the lines of particular industries(oil, aircraft, munitions, etc.), The next decision—to select a director for each major industrial target system—had the effect, whether they intended it to or not, of greatly escalating the importance of what had once been various subdivisions of the proposed economic investigation. In a very real sense, organization determines policy.  As related earlier, upon arrival in London the directors found the organization of the physical damage investigation well advanced and that of the economic investigation hardly off the ground. They responded with two avenues of approach. The first, principally the work of Colonel Perera and then of Mr. Nitze, was a determined effort to devise some model whereby to measure the over-all or cumulative economic effects. The second avenue was to charge each of the “industrial directors’’ with analyzing the production loss attributable to bombing in his own area of responsibility. Using the results of both approaches, a top-flight economist (to be designated as director of an Overall Economic Effects Division) would then prepare a general report covering all industries. Faced with translating this policy into effect, it was all but inevitable that Alexander and Nitze would seize upon the well organized and well  The Survey Is Organized 71  staffed Physical Damage Section to provide the necessary man- power. Planning the operations of the other Divisions could not be allowed to wait upon the completion of the slow moving recruitment program in Washington.  One additional factor contributed to the decision to reduce the emphasis originally accorded to physical damage studies. This was the growing conviction of Nitze in particular that those engaged in such studies were overly concerned with drawing up an infinite number of highly technical
