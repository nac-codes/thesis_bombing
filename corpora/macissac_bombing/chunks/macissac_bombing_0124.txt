rded to physical damage studies. This was the growing conviction of Nitze in particular that those engaged in such studies were overly concerned with drawing up an infinite number of highly technical reports, overly larded with ‘‘fancy’’ drawings, isometric models, and other elements of the language of structural engineering, on the whole incomprehensible to laymen. However valuable such reports might be to scientists was less Nitze’s concern than was getting on with the larger task of coming up with broad conclusions and recommendations on the conduct of the offensive as a whole. Announced in late January, the rape of the Physical Damage Division (as it_was finally designated) was completed by the middle of March.°5  As shown in Figure 2, the final organization of the Survey included another five Divisions beyond the Services Division and the seven Divisions under Economic Studies. These were, under “Military Studies,” a Military Analysis Division®® and the reduced Physical Damage Division; and under ‘Civilian Studies,” the Civilian Defense Division (Colonel McNamee), the Morale Division (Rensis Likert), and, one of the last to be formed, an Area Studies Division, a group under George Ball’s general direction that would seek to weigh the effects of the RAF ‘‘area attacks.”” Thus Ball (Transportation and Area Studies), like Nitze (Equipment and Utilities), was officially responsible for the activities of two Divisions. There were thirteen Divisions in all, every one of them to be dwarfed in size by the Secretariat (see below) when the time finally came to translate findings into reports.  Imparting a Sense of Direction to the Effort  Structural organization was one thing; devising a coherent and comprehensive intellectual approach to the undertaking as a whole was a problem of a higher order. Where Nitze had taken the lead in forcing through the reorganization into multiple Divisions, Alex- ander took it upon himself to supervise the attempt to define, in  File: ---
