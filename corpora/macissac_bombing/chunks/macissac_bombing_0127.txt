ecision was made to adopt an IBM punch card system for compiling the record of USSTAF and RAF attack data, the Secretariat expanded to include a Tabulating Services Section.3 Still later, when the final reports were being prepared, the entire publishing effort (typing, editing, proofing, printing) was centered in a Publications Section that came to employ some 487 persons, many of them on loan from USSTAF.  Time passed, but one ugly problem would not go away. Just exactly how would the Survey go about measuring precisely the production loss attributable to bombing?  To determine what production would have been in the absence of bombing, we will start out by examining the German plans of production; subtracting actual from planned output, however  will by no means yield the loss due to bombing. .. . In the U. S., for example, actual production frequently fell below planned production by as much as 30-40% even though we have never been bombed. In the second place, bombing may result not only in actual output falling below planned; it may also lead to the plans themselves being revised downward....In the third place, we cannot accept the production plans of the Germans at their face value without a preliminary analysis to determine whether they are realizable goals or merely wishful thinking.  Added to the conceptual problem were others. A// targets could not be visited owing to limitations of time, people, and proposed occupation zones. So some sort of sampling method would be necessary. And always there was the persistent problem of time; not only was Washington demanding answers, but in addition the civilian experts had been told they could go home after sixty to ninety days on the job. Some sort of compromise, it became clear,  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 56 --- 74 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  would be necessary.  Although never precisely set down in written form, the basic trend of the approach became this: Field Teams would investigate as many
