6 --- 74 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  would be necessary.  Although never precisely set down in written form, the basic trend of the approach became this: Field Teams would investigate as many important targets as possible; in doing so they would compile comparable data on as many levels as possible—by visual inspection and measurement, interviewing workers and plant officials, inspect- ing production records, compiling data on receipts from sales, even measuring the flow into plants of electric power thereby to interpolate varying rates of plant activity; at the same time, other Field Teams would search the various German ministries and military headquarters for statistical and analytical reports of value; still other Teams would have as their ‘‘targets’”’ particular persons (Speer, Goering, Willy Messerschmidt, Kurt Tank) presumed to have special knowledge of bombing effects and resultant decisions; all the information, whether compiled by inspection, from captured records, or from interrogation, would then flow back to Survey headquarters; the directors, capable but only human, would then put their heads together and draw the most reasonable conclusions of which they were capable from the data available.  If not exactly an acceptable technique for the laboratory, this general approach was nevertheless the best available in the circumstances. It included capabilities for cross-checking data (power input vs. production output, attendance records compared to production levels and contrasted with reports of witnesses, etc.); it put qualified experts on the scene to make the all-important initial findings; it established a central control point to which all data would flow; and it provided, in the persons of the directors, capable men, well schooled in the business of making important decisions, often in the absence of as much information as might be useful. In short, the Survey was like any other committee except in one important respect; unlike many, it had i
