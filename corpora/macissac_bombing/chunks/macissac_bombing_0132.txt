What it does say, however, is that exclusive concentration on the transportation attacks would not have allowed successtul achievement of the air forces mission— assured air superiority over the intended point of assault.  In Eisenhower's eyes General Spaatz’s stature, always high, rose even higher. Two days after D-Day the supreme commander agreed that oil was now the number one priority. For the next three months Spaatz’s bombers flew missions against oil targets whenever the weather permitted. Yet even as before the majority of sorties during the third quarter of 1944 were flown against targets less palatable to the air planners.  From June through August there were almost daily requests for bombing missions in direct support of the ground forces trying to break out from the lodgement at Normandy. Then V-1Is started hitting London beginning on 12 June, followed by V-2s beginning in September, leading to urgently repeated requests to attack the launching sites. (The British, understandably, wanted the launching sites destroyed; but Air Marshal Harris of RAF Bomber Command, citing the greater accuracy of the American forces, insisted that the Eighth Air Force should take on such missions.

As was his way, however, he was careful to keep his most phlegmatic comments to himself in an informal diary maintained in his office. At one point in June, after a conference at SHAEF, he wrote despairingly of Eisenhower's suggestion about using B-17s to drop supplies to partisans in southern France, and of “Leigh- Mallory and Monty, who visualize the best use of our tremendous air potential as plowing up several square
