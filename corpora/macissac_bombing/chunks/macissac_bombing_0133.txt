uggestion about using B-17s to drop supplies to partisans in southern France, and of “Leigh- Mallory and Monty, who visualize the best use of our tremendous air potential as plowing up several square miles of terrain in front of the ground forces to obtain a few miles of advance!” Despite the rapidly increasing numbers of available aircraft—more than 2,000 in RAF Bomber Command, more than 2,000 in the Eighth Air Force, more than 1,000 in the Fifteenth Air Force—there seemed always to be one obstacle or another to the hope of throwing the whole force over Germany for any considerable length of time; the promise of “Big Week”’ back in February seemed forever one step beyond reach.  From July through November, the Eighth Air Force, using ‘‘its rare days of freedom from commitments to help the land forces,” pressed home the attack against the German oil industry.2 During this period the ground armies broke loose from Normandy and swept across France, only to be halted short of the Rhine by logis- tical shortcomings. It is to the apparent stalemate that loomed on the horizon in October 1944 that one must look to understand how, in the last six months of the war, the strategic air forces moved further and further away from what had been their original goals; and how a club was fashioned from what had been intended as a sword.
