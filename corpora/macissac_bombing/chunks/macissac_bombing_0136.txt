sive results than we are  VA getting now.  So despite the earnest intentions of Spaatz, Eaker, and Assistant Secretary Lovett, the Army Air Forces drifted toward a concerted attack against Germany that came more and more to be character- ized by techniques reflecting ‘‘area” rather than ‘‘precision” attack. The attacks of 1945 against Dresden, Berlin, and the Ruhr indus- trial area cannot, afterthoughts to the contrary, be called precision attacks.!0 Near the end of his account, one commentator on these events offered one explanation of what had happened during the closing months of the air war.  A force designed as a precision instrument had become one expressing the concept of total war. This change had not been intentional and the fact of the change taking place would certainly be denied by most senior American officers who held high command in these concluding months. But the record is against them. It is a record of industrial destruction, wrought during the course of an area offensive; it is not a record of industrial destruction as seen in the determination to bomb | Schweinfurt or Regensburg or aircraft factories or oil installa- | tions or transport centres. As with most other aspects of the i strategic air offensive, it is probably the case that this change was inevitable, certainly once strategic objectives became super- | seded by those derived from the doctrine of unconditional | surrender. Perhaps all one can say is that nothing more aptly |} illustrates the near-impossibility of returning to strategic first principles once the pressure of events and changes {in] political |, circumstances have blunted or distorted them.  Hard words, these, and reflecting deep-seated fears. Their author, Anthony Verrier, is journalist first and historian second, and the pre- cise application of some of his words—e.g., ‘area offensive,” ‘‘As with most other aspects of the strategic air offensive,” etc.—may be adjudged too strong in the particular circumstances of which
