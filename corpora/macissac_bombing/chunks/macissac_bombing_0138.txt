he assumption that blind bombing was better than no bombing,’ General Cabell wrote:  The ‘only’ justification!? What about the imperative to develop the equipment and techniques to use, in battle, radar bombing so as to make ours an all-weather force? This would be needed in Japan, in future wars, and even currently in the European Theater in the event that the German jet fighter should have materialized as feared.  When Franklin D’Olier and his colleagues convened at Cologne on Easter Sunday, 1945, the strategic air offensive was drawing quickly to a close.15 The Rhine had been crossed the week before and General Eisenhower, in a press conference on 28 March, had described Germany as a “whipped enemy.” Now on the verge of their most important work, the members of the Survey would not worry themselves with the sorts of questions raised in the preceding paragraphs. From a vantage point thirty years later, it may seem surprising that they concerned themselves so little with tracing, step  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 60 --- 82 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  by step, the trend of air operations. Yet if one considers the way they prepared themselves, the extent of their knowledge, and the politi- cally explosive nature of some of the questions they might have raised, then surprise gives way to understanding.  As shown in the preceding chapter, the Survey members from the beginning structured their approach so as to concentrate on the economic effects of bombing on industries, whether discrete or inter- locking. This resulted not only from the background briefings they were given on the origins of the theory of precision bombing, but also from the decision to make the top ranking civilian industrial advi- sors the core of the executive committee of directors. A second rea- son why basic questions about the control of bomber forces would tend to be overlooked lay in the relative innocence of the civilian members on questions of operational techniques, matt
