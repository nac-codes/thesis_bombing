A second rea- son why basic questions about the control of bomber forces would tend to be overlooked lay in the relative innocence of the civilian members on questions of operational techniques, matters of technical and tactical feasibility, and the day-to-day decisions that had to be made in the improvised 16 air war. Whereas the Survey was in possession of copies of all the target directives, its members were, for the most part, unaware of how often these had had to be ignored. Some members, however, particularly among the military, could also see that the intricacies of the whole question of bombing policy pre- sented questions and problems that might better be put aside for the present.  The reader will recall that as early as December 1944 Mr. D’Olier had sought to downgrade the emphasis given to criticism of any sort; establishing the factual effects of the bombing that had taken place was to be the sole concern of the Survey’s lower echelons. Evaluating the effects and criticizing, if appropriate, were to be the province of the directors, vice-chairman, and chairman. By March of 1945, how- ever, the trend of thinking at the topmost level of the Survey reflected an increasing unwillingness to broach the difficult, perhaps imponderable, questions of bombing policy. This thinking is clearly revealed in a letter of 22 March 1945 from Colonel Perera to General Kuter. ,  Alt is the opinion of the undersigned that the directives under _which the Survey is operating confine its scope to the appraisal lof the effects of strategic bombardment and do not include the ‘evaluation of the effort, or the conduct of operations. While it |may be difficult to draw a line between these three factors, the ‘report of the Survey should consist solely of findings of fact  bearing upon the first.
