’s assistant, a Professor Boethe who had been Enloe’s professor at Heidelburg in the early thirties. After two days of interrogating both men in their laboratories, Enloe became suspicious that Boethe was concealing from him the nature of his most important research; Boethe was primarily a physicist and the visible equipment in the labs appeared to extend beyond that needed for medical research. Playing on some mutual jealousies and rival- ries between departments, Enloe got Kuhn to admit that Boethe had been at work at Mordau in the Black Forest on short wave radio research. While this lead was tracked down by others, Enloe then got Kuhn, who was also president of the German Chemical Society, to reveal the hiding place of the Society’s library, considered the most complete of its kind in the world. The uncovering of the library, located in a cave near Rupertsfeld, some seventeen miles southeast of Berlin, involved entrance through the back of an inn, secret passageways, and mysterious passwords.  While exploits of the sort mentioned here were atypical of the essential drudgery that characterized much of the work of the Field Teams, they were not as atypical as one might assume. Another example was the discovery by Colonel Peter Beasley (from AAF Headquarters, working with the Aircraft Division) in the Hartz mountains of the organizational records of the Speer ministry, the personal files of Speer (including a house-by-house, factory-by- factory record of bomb damage in Berlin through February 1945), the records of the German Institute for Economic Research, and forty-one lead-lined boxes containing design data on jet engines, V-1 and V-2 weapons, and poison gases. Hopefully Beasley was wrong in his statement that “The whole of the next war was there.”’ Still an- other example was the discovery by IBM experts of the Tabulating  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 65 --- 92 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  Services Section of 150 tabulating machines in the cel
