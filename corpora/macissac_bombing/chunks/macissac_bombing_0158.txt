He would, I think, do a very good job.” 7 Taking his lead from Ball, Nitze met with Galbraith, convinced him to take the job, and arranged for him to join the Survey in London.  No sooner did he arrive in April than Galbraith made his presence known. At his first staff conference he put his finger on one aspect of the Survey’s approach—its fascination with statistical data—that he felt was unrealistic. The Survey, he insisted, should not allow itself to fall into the error of overemphasizing statistical data to the neglect of the sound judgment that in many cases would have to be exercised on the basis of evidence falling far short of detailed facts and fig- ures. In this respect, Galbraith’s views fell in line with those of Nitze  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 67 --- 96 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  and Alexander to the effect that if the job were ever to be completed, some sacrifices of exactness would have to be accepted. Although the search for German records of all sorts continued, from April on the emphasis was on finding analytical reports like those of Wagenfuehr and Passauer and on interrogating as many high-ranking govern- ment officials as possible.  Another reason for seeking out the testimony of German officials was the growing realization at AAF Headquarters that the most impressive evidence they could present to the public was in the form of authoritative testimonials from Germany’s former leaders. A blunt statement by Speer or Goering to the effect that “strategic bombing had done thus and so” was found to be far more persuasive than even photographs of gutted factories. So far as the Survey itself was concerned, such statements could be checked against other evi- dence and, in any event, could not be ignored.
