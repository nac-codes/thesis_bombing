Surely effective results should have come at a faster pace.”’ Statements like these, whether meant teasingly or not, met a frosty reception from those who had flown over Germany themselves and who had lost innumerable friends, often before their very eyes. Coming as they did now, when career officers could see that the next ‘“‘war’’ would be fought over who won the last one, they had to be answered at the source.
