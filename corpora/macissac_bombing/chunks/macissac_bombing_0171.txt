It was to be almost two months, nonetheless, before the new tactics were initiated in full. General LeMay’s first missions followed the general pattern begun by Hansell, deviating only to conduct experiments with various types and loadings of incendiary bombs.8 Not until the night of 9/10 March 1945 did LeMay send out the first massive night incendiary raid.  On that mission 334 B-29s took off carrying a total bomb load of some 2,000 tons. The average load per plane was closer to six tons than the three it had normally been; this was made possible by Le- May’s decision to- strip the planes of their defensive weapons and ammunition and to bring the planes in over the target at altitudes varying from 4,900 to 9,200 feet. Both of these changes were severe tactical gambles, but the savings in fuel consumption and the ele- ment of surprise—coming in at low level and under cover of dark-  ness—were thought worth
