d prevailed over those who sought to find some surgically precise method for the application of force. Arter the war there would be much hand-wringing and remorse over the results; indeed, even within the Survey itself were many who devoutly wished that victory might have been achieved in some other way.12 Those of us thirty years later should rejoice that men felt and continue to feel that way. But we should at the same time be wary of criticizing those who were charged with the direction of events. Those men had not our perspective; instead, they had a war to win and the sooner the better. Their political leadership had determined upon uncondi- tional surrender and it was their task to bring that goal to fruition with the least number of Allied casualties. The present writer, whose memory of those days is fairly dim in many respects, remembers one thing vividly: had any Allied commander been found guilty of bring- ing less than the total possible force to bear on the enemy, thereby to shorten the war and ‘‘bring the boys back home,” he would have 3 Nik advised not to appear unprotected on Main Street,  Upon its redeployment to the Pacitic theater, the Survey found it- self with a task that resembled only on the surface its work in Europe. In the first place, the scale of attack (measured in terms either of tonnage dropped, missions flown, or places attacked) was considerably smaller. Compared to the almost 2,700,000 tons dropped over Europe (of which 1,360,000 were dropped within Ger- many’s borders), the total tonnage of bombs expended in the Pacific was only 656,400, of which some 161,377 tons (24 percent) fell on the Japanese home islands. And of the total bomb tonnage dropped on Japan, less than 22 percent was directed at specific industrial (pre- cision) targets.*% Also different was the greatly increased rate of attack, the majority of the effort being concentrated in the five months of March to July 1945. Another major difference was that President Truman’s
