*% Also different was the greatly increased rate of attack, the majority of the effort being concentrated in the five months of March to July 1945. Another major difference was that President Truman’s letter to Mr. D’Olier of 15 August 1945 formally inviting the Survey to evaluate bombing in the Pacific thea- ter, specified that the study should include “‘the effects of all types of air attack.’ By this it was meant that the Survey would investigate the Navy’s participation as well as that of the Army, and tactical as  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 73 --- 108 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  well as strategic operations.!5 A final major difference, of course, was the requirement to evaluate the effects of the atomic bombs.  To these differences—in scope, rate, and weight of attack; in wea- pon types used; and in the scope of the Survey’s charter—were added others having to do primarily with organization and person- nel. The Survey’s basic approach and techniques having been covered in the preceding two chapters, it is to these differences that primary attention will be directed in the present chapter.  On the whole, the Survey’s affairs ‘ran much more smoothly than they did in Europe.” !6 Three factors account more than any others for this. First, of course, was the experience gained from the Euro- pean effort. What new problems arose were essentially administra- tive or logistical rather than conceptual. Second, the prevailing conditions in Japan were much more amenable to research than those encountered in Europe. Completely organized before landing in Japan, the men of the Survey found a reasonably intact system of local and national government in a land completely subdued and subject to the fancies of a single occupying authority. This situation contrasted markedly with the chaotic advance behind the ground forces in Europe into a land artificially divided into jealously guarded zones of occupation. A third factor making for smoother operations was
