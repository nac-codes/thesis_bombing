ted markedly with the chaotic advance behind the ground forces in Europe into a land artificially divided into jealously guarded zones of occupation. A third factor making for smoother operations was the virtual elimination of the occasional civil-military conflicts among Survey members that had occurred in Europe. This factor, in turn, was adducable to three others.  First, the ‘bad apples,” whether civilian or military, were weeded out upon return to the United States and prior to redeployment. Second, the relative number of civilian experts was reduced, the chairman seeing fit to rely more heavily on military officers (many of whom, to be sure, were by background equally capable and in uni- form only for “the duration’’—as it was known in those days).17 A third reason accounting for reduced friction between civilian and military members was that the latter, primarily the AAF and Navy members, found themselves too busy fighting amongst one another to bother much about the civilians.  Agreeing to Do It and Getting Organized  It was early in July, while in Washington conferring with the Joint Target Group, that Mr. D’Olier was asked by General Arnold to  A Change of Scene 109  conduct a similar evaluation of air warfare in the Pacific theater. Arnold’s reasons for doing so are not revealed in the record, but may be presumed to have been derived from some combination of the following considerations. By the end of June the dominant feeling at AAF Headquarters was that the Japanese, because of the wide- spread destruction wrought by the air attacks, might well be induced to surrender before the invasion planned for November.!8 Should that happen, better that the D’Olier group than the AAF itself be the ones to state that the bombing attacks, unaided by invasion forces, brought on the surrender. Early dreams of a victory through air power in Europe had been dashed, but the Japanese situation promised another opportunity. And only by capitalizing on that opportunity, it
