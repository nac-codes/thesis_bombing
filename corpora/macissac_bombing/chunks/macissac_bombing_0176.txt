ught on the surrender. Early dreams of a victory through air power in Europe had been dashed, but the Japanese situation promised another opportunity. And only by capitalizing on that opportunity, it was felt, could an incontestable case be made for maintaining, after the war, a strategic bombing capability second to none. And what better case could be made for an independent Air Force than the conclusion, endorsed by a “prominent group of objective civilian experts,’ that the AAF had ‘twon the war’’? (To “induce surrender”’ is hardly the same as to ‘twin the war,”’ but the difference was not likely to be spelled out all that clearly in news- paper reports.)  Also relevant was Arnold’s knowledge of developments relating to the atomic bomb. This awareness undoubtedly fueled the feeling cited above and at the same time made it clear at the most impartial level of thinking that a special study of bomb damage effects would be carried out by some agency or other. Better the D’Olier group, specially augmented, than some unknown quantity. Also pertinent, perhaps, was a feeling that the Survey’s disinclination to go along with the policy of incendiary attacks on cities might be alleviated if they were to see for themselves the effects of those attacks. And finally, of course, there was the question of balance. Since the AAF had instigated the Survey in the first place, it might seem strange to some interested parties (Congress, newspapermen, members of the other armed services) if the D’Olier group were not invited to com- plete the task already begun.  Whatever his reasons may have been, General Arnold had to use his most persuasive powers to convince D’Olier to continue. It was only after meeting three times with D’Olier—and after some insis- tent name-dropping to the effect that General MacArthur and Admiral Nimitz agreed with Arnold that the D’Olier mission was a vital service to the nation—that Arnold succeeded in convincing  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 74
