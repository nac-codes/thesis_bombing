For a general to support navies and an admiral to argue for a long-range, land-based strategic bombing force would have been contrary to all the rules of human nature; more important, for either to have done so would have been to put himself in the position of offering an amateur, unprofessional argument. Any Congressional committee would have been quick to remind the general, for example, that they would prefer to hear about naval forces from someone competent to treat the matter. Hence a decision to commit oneself to the struggle for maintaining armed forces second to none placed a man inevitab- ly in the position of arguing the case for his own service.

Not only was this potential adversary specific, he was secretive, suspicious, mysterious. The apparent Russian determination to conquer all of eastern Europe was soon interpreted by many to represent only the first step on the way to “communizing” all of Europe. Indeed, even among some of the airmen who had hoped for victory in Europe without the need for an invasion, a feeling arose that it was perhaps just as well that we did position troops on the continent; had we not done so, some felt, it might well have been the Russians who drove the Germans from Normandy.45  Undoubtedly, the senior commanders who worried themselves over these matters—especially about the probability of wholesale disarmament on the part of the United States—went overboard to a degree. The American public, after all, was not blind to the implica- tions of the atomic bomb. But by the same token, military leaders were instantly faced with enormous pressures to get the boys back home. Every day, every commander received letters from wives, mothers, maiden aunts, and former employers: ‘‘Wh
