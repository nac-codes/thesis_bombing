of the Naval Analysis Division Report, The Campaigns of the Pacific War, USSBS Pacif- ic Report #73.  When the Military and Naval Analysis Divisions had originally set to work in Tokyo, they, like each of the other Divisions, planned to prepare a series of reports the results of which would be summarized in one volume representing, for the Division, a summary of its findings. Accordingly, Admiral Ofstie’s staff set to work compiling a report tentatively entitled ‘‘The Carrier Air Effort Against Japan,” while at the same time General Anderson’s officers worked on their report to be called ‘*The Over-all Air Effort Against Japan.’’ Trouble began as soon as the first drafts of these reports were exchanged between Divisions upon their return to Washington.  Ofstie’s report, in the eyes of the Military Analysis staff, was mistitled; instead of treating the part played by carrier air against the Japanese homeland, it was, in fact, a laudatory history of the entire carrier task force effort throughout the Pacific. Anderson’s report was similarly repugnant to the Naval Analysis staff in that it tended to belittle the efforts of the fast carriers, and to lapse all too frequently into such statements as “air power dominates naval warfare.”’ For Ofstie the intent was obvious: by failing to distinguish between land-based Army aircraft and carrier-borne naval aviation (by using terms like air power), Anderson was trying to make a case for the centralized control of all air elements, was trying to record the war in such a way that a new independent Air Force might make a case for taking away the Navy’s primary offensive weapons.  The respective drafts were returned to their originators and a few meetings took place, all to no avail. Ofstie, positively repelled by Anderson's attitude, escalated the battle by retitling succeeding drafts of his report “The Air Effort Against Japan.”’ By continuing to use the word “‘Japan”’ in its widest possible sense, by dropping the qualifying wor
