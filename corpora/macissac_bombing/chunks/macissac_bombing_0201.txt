Anyone reading such a report, Anderson concluded,  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 83 --- 128 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  would come away with the impression that the Army Air Forces had not been involved in “the air effort against Japan.’’ Nonetheless, Ofstie forced the issue at a meeting attended by both D’Olier and Nitze. Siding with Anderson, Nitze objected to the report and wrote a letter to the Navy Department stating not only that the Survey would not publish it but that the Survey objected to its outside publication (e., by the Navy) because of its indicated relationship with the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey.49  Here the matter might have ended, Nitze having indicated at the same meeting that the Military Analysis Division report was similarly unacceptable.90 Anderson then returned to his new post as commandant of the Air War College at Maxwell Field while Ofstie left Washington to participate in Operation CROSSROADS at Bikini Atoll. Before departing, Ofstie instructed his staff to press on with renewed vigor on yet another report, already in the mill, in this case one designed to portray in explicit terms the full range of naval operations in the war against Japan.
