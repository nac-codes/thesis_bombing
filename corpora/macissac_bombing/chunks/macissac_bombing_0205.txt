appeared to represent special pleading at best, deliberate dissimulation at worst. For Ofstie, its conclusions, which included a carefully worded, yet very plain, justification for a theory of “preventive war,” were wholly one-sided and utterly misleading. Anderson’s final paragraphs summed up the report’s repeated themes.  Before World War II the growth and development of airpower was restricted by concepts of surface warfare which visualized the air weapon as an ancillary force. Airpower entered the war under this handicap and by slow evolutionary steps, each based  ee  A Change of Scene 131  on hindsight, emerged as the primary force. Airpower was the dominant combat force of the war against Japan and was decisive in that— Airpower dominated its own element. Airpower dominated naval warfare. Airpower dominated ground warfare. Airpower possessed powerful and independent logistical capabilities. Airpower established effective area interdiction by occupa- tion of the air space over an objective area. Airpower was capable of forcing the capitulation of an enemy without surface invasion.  If our nation is to survive in this atomic age, logic demands that our national defense agencies be oriented toward airpower, and, further, that the future development of airpower not be restricted, as in pre-World War II yensy, by the inertia of established organizations or personalities.  Admiral Ofstie’s passionate reaction to Anderson’s report can be seen in the following excerpts from his reply to Vice-Chairman Nitze:  It was suggested that this manuscript . . . would complement or serve a parallel purpose to ‘The Campaigns of the Pacific War,” which was prepared by the Naval Analysis Division. With the latter suggestion [ am in complete disaccord. Rather than being in any sense an objective study of the war, I find “Air Campaigns” to be in major part a vicious and deliberate attempt to discredit the entire Naval service. That is my summary of the manuscript, but I am appending
