That this goal proved impossible of attainment has been shown in the preceding chapter. But factors other than inter-service feuding were responsible.

General Fairchild had been appointed to head the new Air University at Maxwell Field and wanted General Anderson to set up its senior school, the Air War College. The Navy Department was equally anxious to reassign Admiral Ofstie to liaison duty with the Atomic Energy Commission. More junior officers, with an eye out to their own careers, contemplated with foreboding the idea of remaining too long with an outfit that was going out of business.

In such circumstances, the pattern of continuing work was established as follows: individuals were assigned responsibility and timetables for completing various reports; these in turn would be scrutinized by the editors in the Secretariat, now under Mr. (former- ly Lieutenant Commander) Walter Wilds: upon approval at that level the
