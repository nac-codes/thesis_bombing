It brought home to the German people the full impact of modern war with all its horror and suffering. Its imprint on the German nation will be lasting.  The italicized portions above represent the single most-quoted paragraph from the Survey’s findings in Europe. It is important to note that it represents, at best, a muted endorsement of strategic bombing as conducted in the European Theater: it does not say “American,” it says ‘‘Allied;”’ it does not say ‘“‘strategic bombing,” it says ‘air power’’ (which must be taken
