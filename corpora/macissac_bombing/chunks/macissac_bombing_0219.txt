endorsement of strategic bombing as conducted in the European Theater: it does not say “American,” it says ‘‘Allied;”’ it does not say ‘“‘strategic bombing,” it says ‘air power’’ (which must be taken to include all types of air activity, both Army and Navy); and it does not say ‘‘Europe,” it says “Western” Europe. It then goes on to point out that significant results were obtained only a/ter the invasion in mid-1944, and not quickly enough to cause collapse of the German army prior to its being overrun by the ground armies of the Allies. This general conclusion was a source of great concern to Orvil Anderson, forever fearful that Alexander’s carefully chosen words could be picked apart by future critics (as, indeed, they have been).  General Anderson argued repeatedly that the final report should go into detail on the difficulties that had been encountered in attaining air superiority over the Luftwaffe; unless this was done, he feared, the relatively tepid wording of the conclusions would lead people to think that (1) the strategic bombing forces had apparently wasted their first two years of effort in a hit-or-miss series of attacks, many of them non-productive, and (2) even after deciding to zero in on oil and transportation targets, decisive results were forthcoming ‘too late.” Interestingly enough, he feared this because he knew himself that such deductions were valid for the European expert- ence. Attuned as he was toward the future, however, Anderson was struggling somehow to make it clear that the rate of advance in technical proficiency was such that conclusions based on results over Europe, 1942-1945, would prove faulty guides for any similar operations conducted anywhere in the period beginning with the year 1946.  Anderson’s argument was that by stressing the facts in the record of past accomplishments, the Survey was looking in the wrong direction. Instead, he argued, they should seek to identify develop- ing trends and developing capabilities, and thei
