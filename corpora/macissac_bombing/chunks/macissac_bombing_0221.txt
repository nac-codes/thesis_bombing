President Roosevelt’s idea, that it had been composed primarily of civilians, and that ‘therefore’ its findings could be taken as “objective and impartial.”’ (It was apparently widely believed—the AAF press release stated it explicitly—that because the dominant influence on the Survey was wielded by civilians, the findings of the group were therefore objective and impartial, an attitude of mind surely reflecting a less complicated era than our own.)  Headline writers the next day generally took their cue from Alexander’s sentence, ‘‘Allied air power was decisive in the war in Western Europe;’’ many, however, felt free to translate: ‘‘Air Power Beat Reich, D’Olier Survey Finds” (Philadelphia Enquirer); “Bombers Beat Germany Civilian Survey Finds’ (Washington Times-Herald); “Strategic Bombing of Germany is Termed Decisive in Victory ’’ (New York Herald Tribune); ‘They Missed the Pickle Barrel But They Smashed Hilter’’ (editorial in the Philadelphia  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 91 --- 144 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  Record). Many papers printed the Summary Report either in whole or part. In virtually every case, achievement was stressed and criticism played down, although during the next week, editorial writers occasionally had second thoughts, the Chicago Daily News warning, for example, that ‘‘we’ll still need armies and navies.”’  While all this was going on, D’Olier was in Japan, having given Alexander and Colonel McNamee full authority to oversee public release of the first two European reports.

In the months that followed, beginning with the report of the Medical Branch of the Morale Division in December, numerous other reports were made public, the order of release depending upon (1) when they were ready, (2) how well they avoided intra-Survey disagreement, a
