Damage Division were bound to contain classified information they decided to issue a brief and very general account of the effects of the two attacks. Finally, there was the endlessly fascinating question of why the Japanese took so long to surrender. Responsibility for preparing a special report on that question was given to Walter Wilds. As a result, three reports bore the stamp of the chairman’s office: Summary Report (Pacific War), the chairman’s report; The Effects of Atomic Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, extremely general, treating not the bombs themselves or the means of delivery  but simply effects;!9 and Japan's Struggle to End the War.11  The chairman’s report, as compiled by Paul Nitze, turned out to /  {  be rather more than a report on the effects of strategic bombing; as/ |  its title implied, it was a “summary report of the war in the Pacific,” fifteen of its thirty-two pages treating the period prior to the beginning of the air attack against the home islands.
