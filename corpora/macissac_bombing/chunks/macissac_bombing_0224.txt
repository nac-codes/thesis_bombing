Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.  The experience of the Pacific war supports the findings of the Survey in Europe that heavy, sustained and accurate attack against carefully selected targets is required to produce decisive results when attacking an enemy’s sustaining resources. It further supports the findings in Germany that no nation can long survive the free exploitation of air weapons over its homeland. For the future it is important fully to grasp the fact that enemy planes enjoying control of the sky over one’s head can be as disastrous to one’s country as its occupation b physical invasion. ,  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 92 --- 146 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  We underestimated the ability of our air attack on Japan’s home islands, coupled as it was with blockade and previous military defeats, to achieve unconditional surrender without invasion. By July 1945, the weight of our air attack had as yet reached only a fraction of its planned proportion. Japan’s industrial potential had been fatally reduced, her civilian population had lost its confidence in victory and was approach- ing the limit of its endurance, and her leaders, convinced of the inevitability of defeat, were preparing to accept surrender. The only remaining problem was the timing and terms of that surrender.  Having entered the war inadequately prepared, we continued all-out mobilization of all resources to bring ever increasing pressure on Japan, beyond the time when this was still reasonably required.  Partly as a result of seeing at first hand the effects of the atomic bombs, the chairman’s report for the Pacific was much more future- directed than its counterpart for Europe. Also contributing to this tendency to give warning of future needs were (1) the growing confi- dence of the Survey’s top echelon in their ability to comment on th
