the layman reading these lines to interpret ‘air power’ as Army Air Forces (40 percent) and to assume that the following sentence about the mining campaign is meant to imply an additional 9.3 percent, for a total of 49.3 percent sunk by “air power.” Although they dutifully cited the chairman’s report as  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 94 --- 150 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  their source, Craven and Cate obfuscated the issue. The complete figures in the chairman’s report are as follows:  Agent Percent of merchant tonnage sunk Submarines 54.7 Carrier air 16.3 Army land-based air 10.2 Navy & Marine land-based air 4.3 Mining campaign (primarily B-29s) 9.3 Surface gunfire less than | percent Marine accidents 4.0  Thus most of the 40 percent cited by Craven and Cate as attri- butable to “air power’? was sunk by Navy and Marine aircraft, and the 9.3 percent is not in addition to, but a part of, the 40 percent.  Problems of interpretation continued to color the deliberations of the Survey throughout the concluding phase of its activities in Washington. The most significant controversy, that surrounding Pacific reports numbers 73 and 7la, was treated in detail in the preceding chapter. Another offshoot of that controversy, actually one of the opening shots in the battle, was the appearance late in 1946 of report number 72, /nterrogations of Japanese Officials, in two volumes. Published by the Navy, but carrying on their covers the USSBS identification, these volumes contained 118 interrogations of Japanese Naval officials; none of the 118 pertained to strategic bombing. The AAF countered these volumes with one of its own, but made no pretense that it was a USSBS document; even though compiled in part from USSBS interrogations, the publication made no reference whatsoever to the Survey.  The reports compiled by the predominantly civilian Divisions of the Survey had much smoother sailing. In virtually every case they represent calm, dispassionate attempts to c
