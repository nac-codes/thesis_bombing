adumbrated in the Preface, have already been answered in the narrative. Nonetheless, it might be well to summarize some of the conclusions that may be drawn at this point.  The roots of the idea that created the Survey go back well before November 1944 when President Roosevelt signed the letter that became the implementing directive. It was as a result of the delibera- tions during 1943 of the Committee of Operations Analysts that the question first arose— How can we verify the validity of our targeting assumptions and the demonstrated value of the advice (recommenda- tions) of the Committee? Another root, coming into play in late 1943 and early 1944, was the interest of the Target Sections in the office of the Assistant Chief of Air Staff, Intelligence, Army Air Forces. The COA was an advisory group; the Target Sections were the primary staff agents responsible for preparing any formal recommendations forwarded from Headquarters to commanders in the theater of operations.

A third root, much more difficult to pinpoint than the others, was a growing feeling at the highest levels of the Air Staff—tostered primarily by Generals Arnold, Fairchild, and Kuter—that a full- scale evaluation of the strategic bombing campaigns should be undertaken.
