Thereafter, only three matters impeded further progress: (1) the press of other business at AAF Headquarters; (2) the normal staff process of working out the details and securing general agreement on principles; and (3) finding an eminent, objective, yet presumably not unfriendly chairman whose prestige would assure the public that the project was meant to be both serious and impartial.  Since the whole idea of an impartial evaluation was attended by a degree of risk on the part of the AAF, some assurance was necessary that the chairman-to-be was not congenitally hostile either to the military in general or the air forces in particular.

At worst the Survey would provide presumably precise data of immediate utility in the war against Japan; at best it would provide a glowing report on the part played by strategic air forces in the winning of the war. And the risks attendant upon the public disclosure of its findings were attenuated by a general agreement that its activities would remain classified, at least until such time as the secretary of war might decide otherwise.  The organization and composition of the Survey (Chapters Four, Five) bring us to one of the questions suggested at the beginning of the present chapter: Was its composition such as to assure its ability to perform the intended task? The best answer, it would seem, is a qualified yes, qualified in the sense that, looking back, it might well have been improved in a few respects.  Looking Back: An Epilogue 157  The people who made up the highest levels of the Survey were essentially business executives, corporation lawyers, and
