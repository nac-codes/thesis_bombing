ction experts, lawyers of the executive type, and economists?  The answer would seem to lie in the initial briefings given to D’Olier, Alexander, and Lovett by the airmen—primarily Generals Fairchild and Kuter, assisted by Colonel Perera—charged with explaining strategic bombing to the novices. Although it was evident by late 1944 that strategic bombing included, in practice, much more than “precision bombardment of carefully selected targets in the enemy war economy,” the explanations of Fairchild and Perera were limited essentially to (1) the theory evolved at the Air Corps Tactical School in the thirties, and (2) the prior work of the COA on target selection. Thus, the emphasis accorded to what strategic bombing had been envisaged to become played a dominant part in determining how and by what sorts of people it should be  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 98 --- 158 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  evaluated. By VE-Day, however, the effort of the heavy bombers, impelled by circumstances, chance, and personalities, had come to include much more than selective destruction of carefully pinpointed targets. The figures speak for themselves:  Bomb Tonnage Dropped at Principal Target Systems  Percent of Total  Target System (AAF and RAF) Tonnage Aircraft factories 1.8 Miscellaneous manufacturing 2.6 Naval & water transportation F 4.2 V-Weapon launching sites 2.0 Airfields and airdromes 6.9 Oil, chemical, and rubber 9.3 Military (supporting Ground Forces) 11.1 Industrial areas 23.7 Land transportation 32.1 All other 6.3  100.0  Adding together the percentages for aircraft factories, miscella- neous manufacturing, and oil, chemical, and rubber targets yields a total of less than 14 percent of the effort expended, as measured by aimed tonnages. And yet these three categories include most of the carefully selected industrial targets designated for precision attack. The conclusion to be drawn is obvious: the Survey, owing to its initial composition, which resulted
