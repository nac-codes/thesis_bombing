tegories include most of the carefully selected industrial targets designated for precision attack. The conclusion to be drawn is obvious: the Survey, owing to its initial composition, which resulted in turn from what some people had thought constituted strategic bombing, was not really prepared to measure, in the widest sense, the effects of what actually happened. Measured against the effort finally expended, for example, it had too many people involved in measuring the effects of bombing aircraft factories and two few engaged in the fields of land transportation or industrial area attacks.  The foregoing comments, however, should not be taken as carping criticism; they represent only one way of looking at the problem. It is equally important to remember what it was that the AAF wanted to measure and evaluate; and that, quite specifically, was the effects primarily of the attacks they had consciously planned and chosen. That they had had to attack V-Weapon launching sites, that they had had to devote more than 10 percent of their effort to supporting  Looking Back: An Epilogue 159  the ground forces, that they had had to resort in bad weather to attacks on industrial areas rather than specific factories—these along with other necessary ‘‘diversions’’ were facts of life, the benefits accruing thereby to be catalogued, to be sure, but the facts themselves to be regretted rather than highlighted. Looked at in this light, not a man was wasted in the Aircraft, Oil, or Equipment Divisions. In fact, the emphasis accorded the evaluation of precision attacks led to what was probably the most significant of the Survey’s conclusions—that only repeated and sustained attack could assure the permanent dislocation of manufacturing effort.4  Discounting hindsight, is it possible to identify any obvious short- comings in the composition of the Survey? I would suggest three areas or specialties that seem curiously lacking at the director’s level. First, where was the “‘labor repres
