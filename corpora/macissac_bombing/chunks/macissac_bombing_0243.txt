t the rationalization, or the breaking down into discrete parts, of a problem. The sensible historian is never very sure that he can discern the complicated relationships between cause and effect, whereas those more attuned to the scientific method generally assume that uncovering such relationships is precisely what they are supposed to do. Sometimes the scientist—again, in the broad sense defined above—leaves his laboratory (classroom, office, textbooks, ivory tower) to bring his special knowledge to bear on complex human problems such as, in this instance, weighing the effects of certain actions taken in a war situation. More familiar with his discipline than with the complex nature of contributing and countervailing influences on the flow of a never static process like that of battle (campaign, war), the scientist tends to try to limit the available information to what he can work with, if not to what relates primarily to his specific area of presumed competence. He is almost  Looking Back: An Epilogue 161  forced to develop tunnel vision of a sort; he cannot simply throw up his hands, he must reduce the matter at hand to something workable. His analytical and quantitatively-inclined mind sets out to reduce the problem; and each step he takes “forward” represénts, in fact, a step away from the total reality of the situation he is trying to describe or explain.  How do these observations apply to the Survey? They do in that most of the experts employed by the Survey were anything but properly humble historians; they were objective, specialist practi- tioners, chosen for their task because they were that. Aided by the independent nature of the relationships between Divisions of the Survey, they soon found themselves arguing—to take one example— not about the effects of bombing on aircraft factories, but about whether the attacks on aircraft factories were more significant than those on aviation gasoline production. And more often then not, an individual’s attitude
