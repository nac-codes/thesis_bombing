f bombing on aircraft factories, but about whether the attacks on aircraft factories were more significant than those on aviation gasoline production. And more often then not, an individual’s attitude was determined by the Division to which he was assigned. True, such debates, when significant, were resolved at the level of the directors; but it was equally true that even there the adversary process ruled supreme, with an insurance man (D’Olier) and two investment bankers (Alexander and Nitze) holding the reins of authority. While these men did a good job, I would nonetheless hold that they could have benetited—as could others who might someday undertake similar tasks—from the presence in_ their councils of a William L. Langer or a Carl Becker.  So much for special pleading. | have said that ‘these men did a good job,” which brings us to another question raised at the beginning of this chapter—How > well did the Survey perform its appointed task? The answer would seem to be that they did fairly well what was, on the whole, an impossible job. What the directors and those who sponsored the Survey really hoped to find was some precise measurement of the effectiveness of strategic bombing as an instrument of final victory. What they found they had to settle for, however, was the measure of effects rather than effectiveness. The problem is that the measuring of effectiveness changes relative to the level at which it is applied in the process of decision making. One example should suffice to make the point.  Suppose a decision is made to take out a plant producing ball bearings; suppose one hundred bombers are despatched and succeed in utterly demolishing the plant. So far as the commanders and crews are concerned, the effectiveness of the mission is taken for  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 100 --- 162 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  granted to be 100 percent—the given target was attacked and destroyed. But suppose, also, that the ball bearing output of the
