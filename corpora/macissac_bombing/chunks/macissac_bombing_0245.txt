But suppose, also, that the ball bearing output of the destroyed plant is never missed by the enemy throughout the remainder of the war—either because of huge stockpiles or alternative sources of supply. In such a case, the effectiveness of the mission in speeding up victory drops to zero; indeed, the question then arises, when one asks how the one hundred sorties might other- wise have been applied, whether or not the mission’s effectiveness should be described as a negative (or minus) value. Thus, to measure effectiveness, as opposed to effects, becomes a problem of such magnitude as to be impractical, requiring as it does the evaluation of an almost limitless number of decisions leading up to the attack order.  Contributing to the difficulty in measuring effectiveness was the inability to separate the effects of air action from those of the other arms. When General Patton’s Third Army swept past abandoned enemy tanks, in perfect running condition but with empty fuel tanks, it was reasonable to assume that this circumstance was somehow owing to the air attacks on German fuel production. But as the men of the Survey worried, who could be certain? A break- through had been made, the enemy was on the run; perhaps the whole logistical system behind the defending enemy tanks had been thrown out of gear through fear, panic, or ineptitude or—further to complicate the measurement—by air attacks against enemy trans- portation (railways and trucks carrying the fuel to the front). In other words, the concurrent activities of all arms during the last six months of the war in Europe could never be scientifically separated into discrete elements; in the Pacific, the long naval war that preceded air attack on Japan only increased this difficulty.  One other factor limiting the Survey’s ability to evaluate the effectiveness of strategic
