ements; in the Pacific, the long naval war that preceded air attack on Japan only increased this difficulty.  One other factor limiting the Survey’s ability to evaluate the effectiveness of strategic bombing was the decision, made by D’Olier himself, not to seek a precise definition of strategic bombing. Strategic bombing, for the Survey, was bombing conducted by air forces designated as strategic, regardless of the targets attacked. Some airmen and some among the Survey's lower echelons argued that strategic bombing be subdivided into, for instance, strategic economic bombing and strategic military bombing (or tactical support rendered by heavy bombers). D’Olier, encouraged by the senior air commanders who wanted assurance that no part of their effort would be ignored in the final reckoning and himself concerned  Looking Back: An Epilogue 163  to assure that his problem would not become more complicated than it already was, resisted all such suggestions.® Yet if a degree of precision was thereby forfeited, surely D’Olier cannot be blamed; the airmen themselves, then as now, always avoided any attempt so precisely to detine their effort as to run the risk of limiting their ace in the hole—the flexibility of air power, centrally Controlled, in a war situation.  Finally, one must always bear in mind that the Survey was, in essence, a huge committee, subject to all the advantages and disad- vantages that accrue to committee processes. Moreover, it was one of that special type of advisory or fact-finding committee that the U.S. government from time to time appoints for the purpose of rendering a report on a difficult problem. Generally known as the “ Commission” (after the name of the man in charge; e.g., Warren, Kerner, Rockefeller, etc.), such commissions have been a part of the American governmental style since at least 1794 when President Washington appointed one to investigate rebellious groups in Pennsylvania that were threatening the nation with civil disorder.
