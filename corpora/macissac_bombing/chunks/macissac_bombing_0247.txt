All such commissions operate in a political milieu that tends to place restrictions on their ability to report, with utter candor, their findings or recommendations. The members are always aware that a report unacceptable to the appointing authority, usually the President, will serve no useful purpose whatever; it will either be suppressed, played down, or ignored. The degree to which any such considerations apply to the Strategic Bombing Survey I leave to the reader to decide on the basis of the foregoing account; but for those interested in such abstractions, | recommend most highly, as a starting point, the published reflections of Mrs. Elizabeth B. Drew on the general topic of ‘‘government by commission.”  Given the preceding qualifications, it must be admitted that the D’Olier Commission performed a most difficult task as well as could reasonably be expected. If they were unable to define with precision (and for Americans that means a mathematical representation, usually in the form of a percentage) the degree to which final victory was owing to strategic bombing, they nonetheless did manage to compile (1) a definitive record of the bombing effort, (2) a series of careful and very capable reports on bombing effects—including those of various types of bombs on various targets, and (3) specific findings on where, how, and to what extent prewar assumptions and expectations about bombing had been found ambitious at best,  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 101 --- 164 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  wrong at worst.
