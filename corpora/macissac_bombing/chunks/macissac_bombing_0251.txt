nges warfare!’ "’ Speaking then to his own feelings in the immediate postwar years, General Spaatz made it clear that virtually all senior airmen shared MacArthur's initial reaction and, as a consequence, lost interest almost immediately in the detailed findings of the Strategic Bombing Survey.  In one sense both the columnist and the generals were correct; the atomic bombs did change at least the parameters within which air warfare has since been conducted. Their assumption that great fleets ot bombers dropping conventional weapons on industrial and population centers had become a thing of the past was an assump- tion that held valid for more than a quarter century. (It is still too early to speculate seriously on the significance of Operation LINEBACKER II, over Hanoi in December of 1972, as it may relate to the future of air warfare.) Where the error came, however, was in the emphasis given to atomic weapons to the exclusion of all others, and in the inability—so widespread as to be pervasive—to conceive of any form of future warfare in which aircraft armed with conventional weapons would attack targets and structures not unlike those attacked during World War II. The result of this error—a hard word and owing its force altogether to hindsight—was that a number of lessons were forgotten and had to be relearned in Korea and Vietnam. But then this is one of the central themes (ironies?) of the history of military affairs—what is remembered from the previous war usually turns out to be irrelevant in the next, what is forgotten or ignored costs lives and treasure.  For all this, the Survey reports were not entirely ignored, at least among academics and those interested in special topics on which the reports provided useful data. In the years following the war, a number of books appeared that relied heavily on information gathered by the Survey. Among them were a number of studies of a highly specialized nature, of which some of the better known are: Irving L. Janis,
