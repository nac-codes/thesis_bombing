The definitive account of the German bombing raids against England is Major (USAF) Raymond H. Fredetteâ€™s The Sky on Fire (New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1966). The basic history of British military aviation during the war is W. Raleigh and H. A. Jones, The War in the Air, 6 vols. (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1922-37); for the operations of the Independent Force, see 6, pp. 118-74, and Alan Morris, First of the Many: The Story of the Independent Force, RAF (London: Jarrolds, 1968). The best book on American aviation in World War I is I. B. Holley, Jr., Ideas and Weapons: Exploitation of the Aerial Weapon by the United States in World War I (Yale University Press, 1953); supplement Holley with James J. Hudson, Hostile Skies: A Combat History of the American Air Service in World War 1 (Syracuse University Press, 1968).

Quester, Deterrence Before Hiroshima (New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1966), an otherwise unremarkable book.  Notes to Pages 4-8 171]  11. For a short account of the background and significance of the Smuts Memorandum, see Noble Frankland, The Bombing Offensive Against Germany (London: Faber and Faber, 1965), pp. 21-46. The text of the memorandum is in H. A. Jones, The War in the Air, Volume of Appendices, pp. 8-14. For evidence that Smuts was not the first to suggest an independent and separate air service, see Fredette, The Sky on Fire, pp. 83, 112-113.  12.
