English translations by Dino Ferrari (New York: Coward-McCann, 1942) and Sheila Fischer (Rome: Revista Aeronautica, 1958). The 1921 version modified some of Douhet’s earlier views. The best short introduction to Douhet is Bernard Brodie, Strategy in the Missile Age (Princeton University Press, 1965; c. 1959 by the RAND Corporation), Chapter 3, “The Heritage of Douhet.”  20.
