Haywood S. Hansell, Jr., ‘American Air Power in World War Il,” (an unpublished, book-length (467 pp.) manuscript. in the Hansell Collection, USAF Academy Library), Chapter 2, pp. 10-18, 24-26. General Hansell was at the Tactical School, first as student and then as instructor, from 1933 to 1938.  23. For aircraft development during this period see Robert W. Krauskopf, “The Army and the Strategic Bomber, 1930-1939,” Military Affairs, 22 (Summer 1958), pp. 83-94 and Colonel George V. Fagan et al., “The Strategic Bomber,” Air University Quarterly Review, 8, 1 (Summer 1955), pp. 89-137. The latter article is illustrated and gives brief histories of the Boeing B-17 “Flying Fortress,” the Consolidated-Vultee B-24 “Liberator,” and the Boeing B-29 ‘‘Superfortress’’"—the three United States strategic bombers in World War II. A chart on pages 134-135 gives for each aircraft: its power plant type, number, and horsepower; maximum speed; service ceiling; maximum range; dimensions; gross weight; armament; and standard crew com- position.  24. “Notes for a Lecture on the Development of the U.S. Concept of Bombardment Operations,” Feb 51, in the Hansell Collection.  2S.

In an interview at the USAF Academy on 7 June 1965, Major General (USAF, Ret.) Haywood S. Hansell, Jr., a principal architect of AWPD-|1 (below), stated categorically that ‘General Marshall was the real founder of American air power. He could have stopped AWPD-1 cold, but he
