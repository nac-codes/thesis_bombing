as the assumption that blind bombing was better than no bombing and it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the ‘numbers racket’—pressure from Washington to get more planes over Europe—was responsible for some wasted effort.’’ (xi) “...radar-bombing methods continued to prove disappointing. The Eighth Air Force had an average circular probable error of about two miles on its blind missions, which meant that many of its attacks depended for effectiveness upon drenching an area with bombs.” (723) ‘Approximately 80 percent of all Eighth Air Force and 70 percent of Fifteenth Air Force missions during the last quarter of 1944 were characterized by some employment of blind-bombing devices. . . . In mid-November, operations analysts of the Eighth estimated that slightly more than half the blind missions of that organization were near failures or worse. . . .’’ (667)  7.

And the weather was final arbiter in any case.”” Craven and Cate, 3, 721. Controlling the effort of RAF Bomber Command proved even more difficult; see Webster and Frankland, 3, 46, 48-49, 57, 304-305, 310.  9.

Craven and Cate never really face up to this issue, although they doadmit (3, 727) that “opposition in the AAF to area bombardment had actually weakened’’ by February 1945. Their treatment of Dresden, however, is disingenuous at best; and for reasons best known to the authors, they make no mention at all of the Eighth Air Force attack on Dresden, 17Apr45, comprising 572 effective sorties.
