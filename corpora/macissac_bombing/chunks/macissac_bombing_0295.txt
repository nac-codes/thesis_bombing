Such repeated revisions made it almost impossible to identify production goals covering any period longer than three months. Destruction of records, either by bombing or by the Germans themselves, left numerous gaps in the records of actual production.  29. One example: when compiling man-hour figures for skilled v. unskilled labor, the Germans counted under “‘skilled labor’’ any work performed by their skilled craftsmen and machine operators; hence, skilled laborers pulled off the job to clean up debris had their time recorded under “‘skilled labor’ while unskilled laborers performing the same task had their time recorded as “unskilled labor.” A thorough discussion of semantic and translating difficulties brought on by the “emergent aspect” of German word construction is contained in an unsigned memo to George Ball, 6Jan4S, ‘‘Progress From 26 December to 6 January,’’ NA, 243, 1, 54, 314.7, “Trans Div Hist.”  30. Noted in most of the final reports of each Division of the Survey, this problem was described also in the Coffin Report (to be described below in this chapter): ‘In many fields the production statistics are full of traps. .. . It must be appreciated that they were usually compiled under some pressure from above calling for increased production. ‘You must demand the impossible in order to get the maximum,’  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 118 --- 198 Notes to Pages 88-90  appeared to be the Fuhrer’s slogan. Under these circumstances Speer must have tended to make his statistics serve his Ministry by sometimes showing Hitler’s demands to have been more nearly met than they actually were. It was the same kind of pressur
