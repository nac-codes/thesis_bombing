For the background to B-29 design, development, and employment, see Craven and Cate, 5, Chapter 1, “The VLR Project.” In time, the VLR designation came to be attached to fighter escorts, the B-29s being designated VHB (Very Heavy Bombardment) aircraft. A good brief narrative of B-29 operations is in A. Russell Buchanan, The United States and World War II (New York: Harper and Row, 1964), Vol. 2, pp. 568-94.  2.
