Maier – Targeting the city: Debates and silences about the aerial bombing of World War II 430wanton terror designed primarily to terrorize populations, whereas the subse- quent more destructive Allied attacks on Italian, German, and then Japanese urban centres (including the massive 1945 assault on Tokyo that may have taken 100,000-125,000 lives), waged with hundreds of planes that could carry far heavier bomb loads, were legitimate military actions (with Dresden perhaps an exception). The heavy attacks on northern French cities and towns in 1944, far more destructive than the German air raids in 1940, have also been largely accepted as a legitimate part of the war effort. To be sure, the German attacks were condemned, because even if the German war eff  ort might be deemed legitimate (though usually considered such only by Germans!), the Luft  waff  e’s bombings oft  en seemed gratuitous and exces- sive, designed just to terrorize and demoralize civilian populations. Th  e attack on the Basque city served little military purpose, and victory was already at hand when Warsaw and Rotterdam were bombed. But what about the Allied air raids? Even if they were possibly as violent as the German attacks, they were oft  en defended as a necessary means to a worthy end. In short, for a long time most post-war debate about the means used was subordinated to consideration of the ends to be attained: Allied victory was a worthy end that justifi  ed the very means condemned when used in the service of an Axis victory — an unworthy end. What has happened, of course, is that the said debate, which has seemed to be quiescent for so long, has now resurfaced. This article is concerned with both the context of the debate and the issues involved. By the very nature of the subject, it must include an analysis of moral questions as well as an historical account. Actually the discussion about means is a two-fold debate though often a rather muddled one. War is
