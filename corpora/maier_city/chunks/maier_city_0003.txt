31aggrieved State should not go to war lightly and, once engaged in war, it should not employ a level of violence disproportionate to the provocation. Conversely many military men, such as General Sherman, have cogently argued that harsh measures used in waging war make war more unlikely. However, many measures in war also ran foul of the other underlying moral priority laid down for the conduct of war: the distinction to be made between combatants and civilians and by extension the distinction between combatants not yet disarmed, and those rendered harmless by capture or injury. In brief: do not kill civilians and do not murder prisoners of war or the wounded. The question of killing soldiers clearly bent on mass retreat is more of a grey zone. (The American air attacks on the disabled and fleeing columns of the Iraqi army in the 1991 Gulf War caused some qualms here, but not such as to become a major theme of discussion in the United States. Americans do not really believe themselves capable of war crimes. When they do occur, they remain the exception that proves the rule.) Intentional destruction of civilian property has also been condemned, but far less intensely. Although the distinction between civilian and combatant has oft  en been erased, it has been recognized since Antiquity. Th  ucydides narrates how the morality of the Greek armies degenerated in the Peloponnesian War. Th  e Melian Dialogue and the repression of Mitylene suggest that male civilians were deemed to be at least potential soldiers; but remember, too, how shocking the Th  racian attack on Mycalessus appeared, where soldiers “sacked the houses and temples and butchered the inhabitants, sparing neither youth nor age, but killing all they fell in with, one aft  er the other, children and women, and even beasts of burden. (…) in particular they attacked a boys’ school, the largest that there was in the place, into which the children had just gone, and massacred them all. ” 1 Tacitus’ Annals are
