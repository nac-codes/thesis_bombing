Still, it was generally recognized as wrong in some fundamental way, and that recognition lay at the basis of what was claimed to be “natural law” or developed as “international law. ” Eighteenth-century theory and practice in Europe attempted to re-impose the fi rewall between civilians and combatants, though not without some military men complaining that this just increased the likelihood of war. Th e issue has become more diffi   cult in modern times, however, in that modern weapons technology has once again tended to erase the distinction between civilians and soldiers. But the blurring has occurred, so to speak, on both sides. On the one hand, the new weaponry has made it harder to limit casualties and destruction. Th  e use of submarines and torpedoes in World War I presented this argument in particularly cogent form. For a submarine to give notice of attack would render it highly vulnerable and far less eff  ective.
