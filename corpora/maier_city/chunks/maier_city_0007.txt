In the Peninsular War of the early nineteenth century and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, the issue of non-uniformed guerrillas had arisen. The Prussian mili-tary insisted that such guerrillas or “franc-tireurs” lost any protection to which captured combatants were entitled as prisoners of war, and could be executed out of hand. Subsequent conferences in Geneva and The Hague attempted not to shield the irregular soldier as such, but to establish guidelines for differenti-ating legitimate militia forces from the “franc-tireur, ” essentially by insisting on some visible insignia and the open, not concealed, carrying of weapons. 4 The “franc-tireurs” were not civilians; they were more akin to spies, who also did not announce their presence and thus could rightfully be executed on discov-ery. Not surprisingly, hard-bitten commanders in such wars often took action without undue precision. And in 1914 the fear of “franc-tireurs” led to massive German atrocities in Belgium. In World War II, however, a guerrilla fighter became a partisan, deserving of recognition as a combatant in the eyes of his British or American allies, but meriting execution in the eyes of the occupying force. Since some German commanders resorted to civilian reprisals as well as executions of captured partisans (Field Marshall Kesselring in Italy was a nota-ble example of such action on a western front), this issue soon eclipsed even the fate of partisans. After World War II, new guidelines drafted in 1949 extended similar protection to resistance fighters, and in recent decades even paramili-tary fighters have asked for similar recognition. Nonetheless, reprisal policy remains at the heart of guerrilla war because it seems to emerge from that “necessit
