and in recent decades even paramili-tary fighters have asked for similar recognition. Nonetheless, reprisal policy remains at the heart of guerrilla war because it seems to emerge from that “necessity” which, despite all the conventions, continues to be the underlying justification of violence. Guerrilla warfare, as practised by World War II partisans and perfected in post-war colonial struggles, deliberately involved the civilian base and drew on its resources. It was a war either to recruit (by conviction or coercion) civilian support for the partisan cause or to make such support too costly. The theory of guerrilla warfare, which French authorities zealously studied from Chinese and Viet Minh writings, basically urged that the distinction between the people and the army be erased. 5 It is the co-involvement of civilians that unites the issue of guerrilla or partisan warfare with that of aerial bombardment. Still, there were diff  erences. Aft er all, partisans acted with putative intent to kill or wound. Th  ey took to the fi  eld or to the forest. But what were the rights and wrongs of bombing civilians — and their families — who merely took to the factories? Bombing did not introduce this issue: bombardment had originated with shelling, and the British had made famous the idea in 1806 of “Copenhagening, ” i.e. the naval bombardment of a neutral city.
