It linked jus ad bellum  and  jus in bello . But what guidance did it actually provide, especially when the results were not so clearly decisive as proponents such as Harris or Lord Cherwell promised. There is no scope here for a survey of the statements and the strategies of the air wars. It is general knowledge that by 1945 Churchill himself had some doubts, and that until a few years ago Arthur Harris was deprived of the honours bestowed on the air warriors themselves. Long before, however, two judgments became commonly accepted: first, that the Americans somehow had clung to precision bombing as a strategy and were less morally obtuse than the British, at least in Europe; second, that the bombing was not really effective in achieving its goals.
