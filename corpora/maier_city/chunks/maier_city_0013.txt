er – Targeting the city: Debates and silences about the aerial bombing of World War II 436insisted. Intuitively, it does seem incredible to think that the massive and con- tinuous attacks on a densely populated country did not cut into transport and production as well as wearing down industrial workers whose nights were spent taking whatever shelter was provided. It was a costly strategy: airmen were not easily replaced and 140,000 British and Americans died in the attacks, while 21,000 planes were lost. It had costs in the Pacific theatre, too, though less in terms of bombers succumbing to defending fighters, for Japan was largely denuded of defence, than in terms of the lives and efforts needed to capture the outlying island bases from which the planes could reach the home islands. Even so, with less tonnage bombing took its terrible toll, even before the Americans used their two nuclear weapons. Perhaps it is useful to separate the arguments for bombing used before D-Day from those afterward. Between 1940 and 1942, Britain was unable to bring any counterforce to bear outside North Africa except by air. Military “necessity” usually remains a highly sub jective factor. But Churchill believed, in my opinion correctly, that it was important for the UK to inflict damage on the foe at a time when his country had been forced out of the continent, its troops in Africa remained hard pressed and it stood, until June 1941, without a major ally. Once Russia entered the war, bombing enabled the British to claim that they, too, were making a positive contribution to the defeat of Hitler. As Overy points out, however, Churchill’s turn to bombing in 1942 was provoked by Stalin’s taunts about Allied inaction with respect to a second front, and it came at a point when it seemed a wasteful diversion of airpower from a better use. 9 Dresden, too, was probably attacked largely because the Soviets complained that Britain and the US were not contributing their fair share in the winter
