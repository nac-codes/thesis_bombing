For a while it was rounded off   to 100,000, then totals of 135,000, gradually rising to a quarter million, were given credence by David Irving in Th e Destruction of Dresden  (1963), who fi  nally seemed to settle for a hundred thousand. It suited the Communist regime to accept such an approximate tally, but more careful estimates revised the number downward. At the entrance to the restored Zwinger, one of Dresden’s architectural treasures, the East German plaque still stands with its take on the history of the Second World War: “destruction of the inner city of Dresden, ” by Anglo-American air forces in February 1945, “liberation” of Dresden from the fascists by the armies of the Soviet Union in May 1945, and reconstruction of the Baroque masterpiece by the German workers’ and peasant State. For the fi  rst scholarly re-evaluation of the death toll see Götz Bergander, Der Luft  krieg in Dresden  (1977), who estimated it at 40,000, and for the most recent evaluation (between 25 and 40,000) see Frederick Taylor, Dresden: Tuesday, February 13, 1945  (Harper Collins, New Y ork, 2004) with its discussion of how casualty fi  gures became infl  ated, pp. 443-48.
