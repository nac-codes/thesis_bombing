tre for mili-tary history. 15 But such works rarely dwell on the experience of being bombed. Commentators have also raised the question why non-neo-Nazi Germans could not write this history so graphically before or let themselves discuss it more openly. The answer put forward by Hans Ulrich Wehler and others is that they If a particular vocabulary becomes associated with what is agreed to be the most abominable atrocity (such as the antiseptic language used by the Nazis in carrying out the “fi  nal solution”) is it illegitimate to use that language for other situations? Is “tasteless” a category that makes sense for historical writing? Saul Friedlaender sought to take up this issue from the other side when he questioned Nazi kitsch – the deliberate eff  ort to evoke the aesthetic dimensions of fascism and Nazism. See Refl ections of Nazism: An Essay on Kitsch and Death , Harper & Row, New Y ork, 1984. We know the phenomenon from fi  lms (Hans-Jürgen Syberberg’s Hitler: Ein Film aus Deutschland , 1977, and Liliana Cavani’s Th e Night Porter , 1974), novels (Michel Tournier, Le Roi des aulnes , 1970; US title, Th e Ogre ), Friedrich’s book suggests that the historian cannot rest content with a history of lived experience, no matter how important it may be to convey that experience. Television, cinema and the preoccupation of society with the testimony of victims have suggested to us that history is sterile without the evocation of experience, but history cannot be merely the excavation of experience — old pictures, sad songs, diary extracts, and the like. To rely on these is our version of a pathetic fallacy. It is appropriate and indeed, I think, oft  en a duty to convey testimony. But doing justice to the witness is not the same as writing history. It may be the beginning or the end of historical refl  ection, but it is a diff  erent sort of exercise. Th  ere can be no history perhaps without memory, but neither can there be history that does not discipline memory.
