uage or lack of balance. Friedrich does understand that after the 1940 defeat in the West, there seemed no choice for the British but to strike at the enemy with whatever weapons were available if they were not to come to terms. Did not morale, as Churchill sensed, require inflicting some damage on an enemy that threatened to invade and was lay-ing waste to London? Could any democratic statesman set on resistance not have followed this strategy? Y et was there not a point at which it changed — as Arthur Harris said it should — from a purposeful pursuit of targets, whether railroads or industry, to moral bombing? Nor is this change surprising. As Friedrich understands, the air war became one of Vergeltung  or retribution in which the British went far beyond the level of destruction they themselves had suffered (just as the American Vergeltung  against Japan vastly exceeded the toll taken at Pearl Harbour that was so often cited as justification). Retribution fuelled the air war as much as did strategy. Peter Wapnewski’s recollection not-withstanding, many Germans impatiently awaited the retaliatory “V” weapons that Goebbels promised. 16 In Lothar Kettenacker (ed.), Ein Volk von Opfern: Die neue Debatte um den Bombenkrieg 1940-45 , Rowolt, Berlin, 2003, p. 122 (author’s translation). 17  Friedrich, op. cit .

As mentioned above, the American Strategic Bombing Survey’s critique of the efficacy of bombing, no longer seems tenable. By the summer and autumn of l944, the war machine was largely incapacitated. Air defences were faltering, produc- tion began to fall sharply. Surely, argue their historian defenders, the tons of explosives that rained down from the air brought about that collapse. To which critics can respond, first, that other factors including military setback on the ground played a
