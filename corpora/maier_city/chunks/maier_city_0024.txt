defenders, the tons of explosives that rained down from the air brought about that collapse. To which critics can respond, first, that other factors including military setback on the ground played a large role and, second, while so-called precision bombing was not precise, the Allies did not have to embrace city bombing so indiscrimi-nately. I personally think that the bombing can be credited with another suc-cess: the demonstrated hopelessness of the Nazi defence had something to do with the fact that after World War II there was no real revanchist movement, no defiant nationalism. But then again, defeat without immolation might also have achieved an equal post-war success. No, the issue remains the price of success; that is always debated, and must be debated by historians as well as by those who were directly involved. The non-existent Anglo-American debate and the issue of reprisal What is striking about these debates is, I believe, first of all the fact that they did not resonate more strongly in Germany. For all the cries about the German pro-clivity to victimization, the bombing issue has hardly become a major or hotly discussed political subject. It has not stirred up public sympathy or awareness like the Hiroshima attack has done in Japan. German civic culture abandoned the tu quoque  attitude it still largely maintained throughout the 1950s. Y es, for a long while there were many stories of victimization — especially among refu-gees from East Prussia, the territories taken over by post-1945 Poland, and the Sudetenland. Friedrich’s book can be seen as a continuation of this strand of self-pitying and often right-wing apologetics, but non-Germans are in fact will-ing to listen to this narrative with a sympathy that was excluded in Germany until very recently, except on the far right. Vaclav Havel’s expression of regret at the expulsions of Germans from the Sudetenland was a conspicuous case in point. Nonetheless, Friedrich’s book and the related series of m
