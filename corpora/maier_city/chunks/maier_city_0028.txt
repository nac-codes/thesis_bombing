risal with the statistical certainty that a given percentage of civilians must be killed thereby. In the final analysis, those of us who would accept the air war say that under certain conditions it may be necessary to burn babies. Even if we are not explicitly targeting babies, we are all familiar enough with statistics to know that our historically mediated choice will kill those whom no theory of a society at war can plausibly claim to have opted for war. Vengeance is mine, supposedly sayeth the Lord. Vengeance, though, is also ours — including civil-ian deaths as long as the victims are not personally selected. This remains curi-ous. Why is it more acceptable that, say, five per cent of a city of half a million will be killed (25,000) so long as we do not specify which five per cent, whereas shooting 50 hostages out of hand is unacceptable? Nonetheless, it is. The issue is not quite that of randomness, for the terrorist does not know which teen–agers will for instance be discoing in the Jerusalem café, or who will already be at work in the World Trade Centre. He or she inflicts death as in a lottery. Is distance the issue? Is whoever kills close up deemed more responsible than he who slays from far away? No matter what the source of these scruples, and whether due to bombing, blockade, radiation or the like, the unspecified death is more acceptable than the specified death. But is it more ethically acceptable to treat life and death as a lottery than to inflict death on specified groups of people. And why is it more acceptable to condone, as a means of warfare, the heavy bombing of cities and towns with the statistical certainty of innocent victims, but to condemn the terrorism that purposely kills innocent civilians as a pawn in a political response. There are two possible answers, and neither is very satisfactory. Terrorism is specifically intended to kill innocents; in city bombing their death is merely accepted. The historian, of course, is not an ethicist.
