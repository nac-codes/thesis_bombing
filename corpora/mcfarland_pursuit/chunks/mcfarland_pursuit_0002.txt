ly 7 percent of all American bombs fell within 1,000 feet of their aiming point. But, given the crude technology of the time, this was considered acceptable. (In fact, when the Royal Air Force learned that 90 percent of the bombs dropped against Pilsen in 1943 had fallen within 31/2 miles of the aiming point, mission planners were overjoyed at the "accu- racy" of the results.) Significantly, even these kinds of results often had a ix  Foreword Ã— Foreword powerful and, at times, paralyzing effect upon a foe: consider, for exan the air-launched Blitzkrieg of 1939-40, or the Allied air campaign ag German ground forces in France in 1944, or the success of the oil c paign against Hitler and the B-29 campaign against Japan. After the wa even the skeptical members of the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey never- theless were forced to conclude that air power had been "decisive in the war in Western Europe," while, in the Pacific, it had demonstrated that "no nation can long survive the free exploitation of air weapons over its homeland." Overall, the USSBS survey noted that, prior to the Second World War, the United States had "underestimated the predominant role that air power was to play" in the coming war. To put a contemporary focus on the precision question, consider the following: During the Second World War, the Eighth Air Force found that it took two full combat wings-a force of 108 Boeing B-17 Flying For- tresses, crewed by 1,080 airmen and escorted by hundreds of fighters with hundreds of other pilots, supported by thousands of ground personnel- dropping a total of 648 bombs to guarantee a 96 percent chance of getting just two hits on a single Nazi power-generating plant measuring 400 by 500 feet. In the Gulf War of 1991, a single coalition strike airplane carrying two "smart" bombs functioned as effectively as this gaggle on similar strikes against Iraqi power-generation stations. Indeed, the average miss distance of a laser-guided bomb was less than 10 feet, the ave
