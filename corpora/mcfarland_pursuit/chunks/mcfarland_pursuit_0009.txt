In July 1926 it became the Army Air Corps (with an additional General Headquarters Air Force in 1935) and in June 1941 the Army Air Forces. Of greater potential confusion, in 1917 the Signal Corps established the Equipment Division, later the Airplane Engineering Department, at North Field, later McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio. In 1918 the new Air Ser- vice changed the unit's name to the Airplane Engineering Division and xvii  xvili A Note on Terms America's Pursuit of Precision Bombing, 1910-1945 then the Engineering Division. In 1926 the leadership of the new Air Corps renamed it the Materiel Division, which moved to Wright Field close to Dayton in the spring of 1927.

The Army preferred to call the Norden the M-series bombsight, with versions of it numbered sequentially (e.g., M-9). To keep it interesting, or at least confusing, the Navy chose to call its autopilots Stabilized Bombing Approach Equipment (SBAE), while the Army Air Corps/Army Air Forces preferred Automatic Flight Control Equipment (AFCE).
