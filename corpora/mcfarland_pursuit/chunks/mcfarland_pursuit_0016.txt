machines and the people of war. The ugliness, confusion, doubt, and discomfort of the Cold War and its nuclear bombs replaced the confidence, principles, and convictions of World War II and its precision bombing of the machines of war based on Norden bombsights. The dead would not appreciate the tragic irony of what had happened at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. One nation, committed to the precision strategic bombing of the machines that produced the weapons of war when the war began and carried out at such great cost in Europe, had by the end of the war against Japan adopted the greatest weapons of mass destruction in the history of the world. Equally ironic, Ferebee and Beahan used the most accurate optical bombsight ever developed to drop weapons that needed the least precise aiming of any in the world until that time. Folk wisdom was that "close only counted with horseshoes and hand grenades." After Hiroshima and Nagasaki, pundits would add atomic bombs to that list. Some public relations whiz once said that a Norden bombsight could drop a "bomb into a pickle barrel"-a phrase that stuck and still haunts the device.11 It never could. One observer watched Norden bombsights in use at Monte Cassino. "I could see bombs bursting 10 miles behind Ameri- can lines. They were dropping them all over the fucking landscape. Maybe it was true that they could hit a pickle barrel with that Norden bombsight, but there were no pickle barrels in the Liri Valley that day."12 No matter. The phrase raised visions of frontier marksmen always hitting their mark-the guilty and never the innocent. It raised images of a special American way of war. It satisfied a deep-seated American need for the moral high ground in war while satisfying an American hunger for techno-  6 Introducbow 7 Introduction logical achievement. Until the arrival of laser- and television-guided con- ventional munitions during the conflict in Vietnam, there would be no more talk of hitting pickle barrels. In the Persian G
