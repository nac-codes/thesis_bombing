logical achievement. Until the arrival of laser- and television-guided con- ventional munitions during the conflict in Vietnam, there would be no more talk of hitting pickle barrels. In the Persian Gulf War, Americans seemed to gain special satisfaction from bombing marksmanship, again satisfying that especially American desire to kill only bad guys, not "inno- cent" civilians (in appearances, if not in fact), with "high tech" gadgetry. Although nearly forgotten in the age of electronics and nuclear weap- ons, the Norden bombsight served an earlier generation as the ultimate technological wonder, the highest achievement of mechanical engineering. It was probably America's first top secret military project, a product of a company that represented the first hesitant step in the direction of what later became America's military-industrial complex, formed to develop a technology for which there was no commercial use. Shrouded in secrecy and myth until late in World War II, it was for Americans an example of good ol' Yankee ingenuity (actually a Dutch citizen living in Brooklyn invented it) and a weapon of democracy that would defeat the forces of totalitarian fascism. Maj. Gen. Benjamin D. Foulois, chief of the Army Air Corps from December 1931 to December 1935, called it "the most important military secret project under development by the Air Corps."13 In Europe American airmen called it the "football," in the Pacific the "Blue Ox," after Paul Bunyan's constant companion. Men and women went to jail or were court-martialed for revealing or trying to reveal its secrets. The U.S. Army and Navy almost went to war with each other over possession of it. Behind these headlines were the difficulties of protecting the security of the Norden bombsight, training some 50,000 young men to operate it, manufacturing 90,000 versions, and devising expensive pro- grams to improve it and studies on how to use it. Army planners created a whole doctrine of warfare, one that continues to i
