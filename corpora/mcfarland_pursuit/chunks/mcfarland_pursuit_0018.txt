n to operate it, manufacturing 90,000 versions, and devising expensive pro- grams to improve it and studies on how to use it. Army planners created a whole doctrine of warfare, one that continues to influence strategic plan- ning today, based on its capabilities.14 The United States spent approxi- mately $1.5 billion (nearly $10 billion in 1992 dollars), 65 percent of the cost of the atomic bomb project,15 to produce 90,000 Norden bomb- sights.16 It was responsible for most of the destruction dropped on Ger- many and Japan from American aircraft during the war, and for killing over 400,000 human beings in pursuit of Allied victory.17 Exposed to the light of history, the Norden bombsight was just a me- chanical device for dropping bombs. Although it did this better than any other similar device of its time, its achievements remain the stuff of mythology. Even today, nearly 60 years since its development, few know little more about the Norden bombsight than an earlier generation when the device was a military secret. One author described the B-17 Flying Fortress in World War II as old technology and the Norden bombsight as new technology-the Norden bombsight first flew in 1931, four years be- fore the B-17. Another wrote that Carl L. Norden, Inc., produced 25,000 bombsights for the United States in World War II at a unit cost of $10,000-it produced over 34,000 and the price never reached $10,000. Another raised an old controversy about a Sperry bombsight being supe- rior to the Norden bombsight, ignoring hundreds of thousands of test bombings that proved otherwise. Still another author of a detailed ac- counting of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki misidentified the Norden bombsight used on the mission as a Mark 15-one can only wonder how many Army airmen from the war might have become incensed at the use of the Navy designation for the Victor Adding Machine-produced M-9B Norden bombsight installed in Bock's Car. And there is the compelling story of Mary Babnick Brown, w
