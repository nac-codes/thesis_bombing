ope at a 45-degree angle in front of the aircraft and waited for an object on the ground to intersect the scope's cross wire. Starting a stopwatch, he pivoted the telescope to the vertical position, stopping the watch when the same ground object again intersected the cross wires, thus measuring his speed relative to the ground. After consulting the barometer for the altitude and a ballistics ta- ble for the bomb time of fall, the bombardier set the telescope at the proper forward angle. When the target appeared beneath the cross wires, the bombardier released his bomb. The first timing bombsight, Scott's device measured the movement of a fixed point relative to the aircraft.3 It depended on the ability of the pilot to maintain a constant speed and altitude during the timing process, but ignored the effects of wind and aircraft oscillation. According to Henry Arnold, commander of American air forces in World War II, Scott achieved "considerably more accuracy than was achieved by just tossing it [the bomb] overboard."4 The War Department expressed little interest in Scott's invention, cost- ing the United States the world's lead in bombsight technology for 21 years. Lt. Paul Beck had to build his own bombsight when he dropped dummy bombs at a Los Angeles flying meet in early 1910. One year later Lt. Myron Crissy dropped America's first live bomb without an aiming  10 Chapter 1 11 Dropping Projectiles from Aerial Crafts TIME OF FALL TIME OF FALL PLANE'S COURSE RELEASE POINT 1 RANGE ANGLE A TRAIL ANGLE VACUUM TRAJECTORY * A LINE OF SIGHT T C ACTUAL TRAJECTORY * B AC=VAB2+BC2 Figure 1.1 device. Crissy's achievement forced the Army to begin tests of Scott's bombsight in October 1911. When airmen accompanied Pershing's Puni- tive Expedition to Mexico in 1916, however, they dropped their small bombs by hand, over the side, with no aiming devices. Scott took his inven- tion to France, where from 650 feet he dropped twelve out of fifteen bombs within 33 feet of the target at
