ack of the aircraft across the ground. This difference between the actual trajectory under the influence of wind and the projected or normal trajectory was crosstrail. Bombing tests revealed the importance of bomb ballistics and wind. Although gravity accelerated bombs toward the ground at a constant rate in a vacuum, in the atmosphere wind resistance and the size and aero- dynamic design of the bomb contributed to varying bomb speeds and dis- tances traveled during the time of fall. Wind affected bombing accuracy, changing the course of bombs after release, but also changing the speed of the bombing aircraft. Linearly, winds increased or decreased the bomber's speed, increasing the range error unless the crew had time to measure ground speed using Scott's timing technique. With all factors calculated, the problem of accurate bombsighting grew  12 Chapter 1 CERSKIEJESTA WIND DIRECTION 13 Dropping Projectiles from Aerial Crafts RELEASE POINT HEADING OF PLANE COURSE OF PLANE COLLISION COURSE PLANE IS HERE WHEN ' BOMB LANDS - SJ-HOW PROJ. \TRAJECTORY BOMB'S ACTUAL TRAJECTORY RANGE LINE ALTITUDE PROJECTED HEAD- -- "PLANE'S TRACK _ _ PROJECTED RANGE LINE PROJ.

World War I-era altimeters were notoriously inaccurate and had no means of adjusting for temperature. His device measured ground speed with a greater degree of accuracy, but did not incorporate the influence of wind and only estimated the effects of gravity on the falling bomb. Scott did not consider aircraft oscillation about the vertical, longitudinal, and lateral axes of flight, which would distort the ABC triangle, altering the basic calculation. His primary consideration was range, calculated as the sum of the speed of the bomb at the point of release and its acceleration toward the ground due to gravity. In World War
