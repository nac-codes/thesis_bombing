the basic calculation. His primary consideration was range, calculated as the sum of the speed of the bomb at the point of release and its acceleration toward the ground due to gravity. In World War I bombsighting calculations were primarily products of bombing tests and experience rather than mathematics. Training in the use of wartime bombsights for Americans consisted of direction from combat- experienced crews and practice near the front. Few cared for the technical aspects of bomb-aiming. Poet Gill Wilson wrote that Pilots get the credit but the gunner rings the bell When we go to bomb the columns on the road to Aix-la-Pelle! . . . Duck to set your bomb sight as the targets may unfold, Figure out your ground speed and compute your angles right For you pack a ton of shrapnel and you make report tonight! . . . Don't lie down you buzzard till you're God damn sure you're dead! . . . Gunners have no license just to crumple down and die While there's still a bit of team work to contribute in the sky!7 Training manuals were largely nonexistent. After instruction bombardiers gained skill from flying missions and observing where certain adjustments of the bombsights caused bombs to fall. The Army established a bombard- ment training center at Clermont-Ferrand, France, in December 1917, but it prepared only 212 pilots and 262 observers before the armistice. Late in the war air forces offered ground bombing trainers. Originally, bombsights that were mounted on movable towers aimed at a board, trainees calling out when they believed they had aimed their sights correctly at a dot on the board. An advanced system by 1918 called for trainees to drop 40-gram dummy bombs from a fixed tower onto a simple conveyor belt moving painted targets past the view of a bombsight.8 With this preparation, airmen learned that a bomb took so many sec- onds to fall from a given altitude and traveled so many feet at a given speed. Flying by the "seat of their pants" solved any other aspects of
