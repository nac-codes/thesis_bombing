preparation, airmen learned that a bomb took so many sec- onds to fall from a given altitude and traveled so many feet at a given speed. Flying by the "seat of their pants" solved any other aspects of the bomb- sighting problem. Simple observation revealed the relative impact of pilot  14 Chapter 1 opping Projectiles from Aerial Crafts errors, changes in altitude and speed, wind, and aircraft oscillations in re- ducing accuracy. An American aviator, Kenneth MacLeish, described his experience: "I sure am crazy about day bombing, because after having been up at Dunkirk during so many raids, I took a keen and personal interest in where my bombs went, and when I cut them loose I leaned over the side with a two-foot grin to watch them, and then I said to those below, Now, you run for a change!"9 The war brought quick lessons, the first of which was dropping bombs over the side of an airplane by hand was an inefficient and ineffective means of bomb delivery, despite MacLeish's grin.10 But if bombing lacked accuracy, the danger of bombing missions was always there. Bruce Hopper of the 96th Bombardment Squadron "sat on a helmet filled with sand as protection" and "we had to look out for trees and German fighters, and we didn't have parachutes."11 There was safety in altitude during bombing runs, though at the sacrifice of accuracy. German Gothas over England typically flew at 12,500 to 16,000 feet.12 The U.S. Army's chief signal offi- cer, in charge of the Air Service, told the Senate Committee on Military Affairs that the Germans had "small chance to hit what they are aiming at. They simply drop the bombs when and where they can." An American General Staff study of 1915 concluded that "at the height at which aero- planes are required to fly it is extremely difficult to hit an object with any certainty" unless attacked with formations of thirty to sixty bombers.13 The first bombsight developed during the war to overcome these limi- tations was the British "pre-set vector" s
