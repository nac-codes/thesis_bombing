and bombs.14 The Wimperis became the U.S. Army's choice to equip the DH-4 bombers American industry built during the war. The only Army modifi- cation was to install a windshield around the sight, which hung from out- side the fuselage, requiring the observer to stand up to use it. In the U.S. Army the Wimperis was known as the Mark I, I-A, and I-B, or the Mark III, IIIA, or IIIB in Navy use, depending on the altitude bars used with the sight. When time was a limitation, the bombardier set the altitude of the aircraft over the target on the altitude scale, estimated the ground speed by adding or subtracting the wind speed to or from the air speed, lined up the rear sight and front sight, and released his bomb when his line of sight intersected the target. When time and conditions allowed, the bombardier used the drift method, after which Wimperis named his bombsight, to measure the ground speed more accurately. The pilot flew at a 90-degree angle cross wind while the bombardier set the drift bar to find wind speed. For the bombing run, the pilot flew the aircraft directly up- or downwind and the bombardier set the air speed indicator, adding the drift setting if downwind or subtracting if upwind. After setting the altitude bar to match the time of bomb fall predetermined from charts, the bombardier attempted to line up the rear sight on the drift bar, the foresight on the altitude bar, and the target. When all three intersected, he dropped his bombs.15 Subject to the oscillations of the aircraft, requiring flying either directly with or against the wind, and with the sight settings based on assumptions of one type of bomb and one speed, the Wimperis represented only an estimated solution to the bombing problem. Inherent errors meant that it would have reasonable accuracy only at altitudes below 5,000 feet. The Edison Photograph Works (Orange, N.J.), the Frederick Pierce Company (New York City), the H. W.
