against the wind, exposing the aircraft to ground defensive fire for up to 11/2 minutes. The bombardier yelled or pulled straps tied to the pilot's shoulders to inform the pilot of the correct target heading. Its major advantage over other bombsights was the French design's use of a pendulum with hydraulic shock absorbers (called "oil dash pots" at the time) to keep the sight mech- anism level and stable despite the aircraft's changes in pitch and roll.17 ROLL YAW Pitch was the deviation from level flight around the aircraft's lateral axis, causing the nose to rise or fall. Changes in pitch caused changes in altitude, making all bombing charts and bombsight adjustments incorrect. Roll was the deviation from level flight around the aircraft's longitudinal axis, tilting to the starboard or port. Roll disrupted the line of sight to the target and altered the vertical line from the aircraft to the ground representing alti- tude. Bombsights measured the sighting angle to the target based on this vertical reference line perpendicular to the ground. Any changes in the line away from true vertical increased inaccuracy (see figure 1.4). The Michelin was the first bombsight to consider the problems of stabi- lization. The best line-of-sight bombsight, regardless of other factors, was subject to extreme bombing errors resulting from aircraft oscillation dur- ing the bombing run. From 6,000 feet, at a speed of 100 MPH, a pitch up or down of only two degrees from the direct line-of-sight aiming angle caused a bomb to land nearly 200 feet long or short in range, respectively. PITCH Figure 1.4 At higher speeds and altitudes, the errors grew proportionally. A roll of two degrees at 10,000 feet would cause a bomb to land nearly 350 feet left or right of the target. Like other World War I bomb-aiming apparatuses, the Michelin did not compensate for wind-caused drift. Wind could change an aircraft's path or track on the ground. As an aircraft tacked into the wind, the head- ing of it
