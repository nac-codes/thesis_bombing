I bomb-aiming apparatuses, the Michelin did not compensate for wind-caused drift. Wind could change an aircraft's path or track on the ground. As an aircraft tacked into the wind, the head- ing of its flight changed to compensate for this drift effect. Called yaw, this deviation from straight flight around the aircraft's vertical axis changed the direction of flight, complicating the bombsighting problem, adding a third dimension of crosstrail (see figure 1.4). The aircraft's crosstrail was the distance between the true course of the airplane marked on the ground as affected by the wind and the collision course to the target. Without this drift, the true course and collision course were the same. The lack of proper stabilization to eliminate oscillation and proper drift determination to eliminate range and deflection errors formed the key remaining obsta- cles to finding a solution for the bombsighting problem. By late 1915 the British had also developed a stabilized bombsight, but did so by using a large Sperry gyroscope to stabilize the entire aircraft, not just the bombsight. The pilot set his course on the directional gyroscope, compensated for drift, and dropped his bombs according to predetermined  18 Chapter 1 pping Projectiles from Aerial Crafts charts. The added weight of the gyroscope made the technique impract cal, but the gain in bombing accuracy proved the importance of elimine ing aircraft oscillation. The British reported average deflection bombno errors of only 65 feet in their stabilized aircraft from an altitude of 6,004 feet, compared to 567 feet of error for a bombsight on an unstabilizen aircraft. Although the claims seemed excessive, bombsight stabilization had proved its worth.18 The U.S. Army made a greater effort to develop a suitable bomb release mechanism than it did developing bombsights, though in early 1918 1 contacted Elmer Sperry Sr. at the Sperry Gyroscope Company about the production of a stabilized bombsight.
