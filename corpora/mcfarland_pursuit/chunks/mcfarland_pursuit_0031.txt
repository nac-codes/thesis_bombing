ase mechanism than it did developing bombsights, though in early 1918 1 contacted Elmer Sperry Sr. at the Sperry Gyroscope Company about the production of a stabilized bombsight. Several months of fruitless corre- spondence followed. Bombsight procurement and development were un- der the control of the Army's Ordnance Department, out of step with the needs of airmen.19 The availability of European sights also limited the ef- fort. In addition to the Wimperis and Michelin, the Army procured the Type A-1 (Mark I), copied from a French design and produced in numbers less than 100 in the United States by the Gorham Manufacturing Com- pany. The Type A-2 (Mark II) was a version of the Wimperis modified for high-altitude work. The Army ordered 1,000 copies from the Frederick Pierce Company. The Type A-3 (Mark I) was a Wimperis modified for low altitude, but was not procured.20 The U.S. Navy's first interest in bombsight development came from Sperry in mid-September 1915, concerning the need to stabilize aircraft. not bombsights, because of the greater inertia of the aircraft. In January 1916 the Office of Naval Aeronautics decided not to proceed with Sperry until all naval bureaus had thoroughly investigated the subject. Elmer Sperry began on his own, designing a gyroscopically stabilized bombsight weighing 60 pounds. In May 1916 the Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) gave the Sperry Gyroscopic Company $750 to design a "bomb dropping sight operated by a gyroscopic artificial horizon." Sperry submitted two proto- types to the Navy in 1918, but no quantity production resulted.21 In April 1918 the Navy contracted with the International Signal Com- pany of Chicago to build a bombsight designed by three naval officers. This "Pilot Directing Bombsight" improved on the Wimperis, assigning the duty of bomb aiming to a spotter, freeing the pilot to concentrate on flying his aircraft. This feature was a matter of necessity, as pilots of Navy bombers flew from the middle of the aircraft and
