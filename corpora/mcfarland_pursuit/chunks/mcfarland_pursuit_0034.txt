ina- tion of the lateral and longitudinal controls of an aircraft. Although not technically an automatic pilot, Sperry's stabilizer used four gyroscopes to maintain level flight by linking the aircraft's control surfaces to the gyro- scopes through a series of servomotors, drums, and cables. The unit main- tained stability in two axes, controlling roll (lateral control about the longi- tudinal axis) and pitch (longitudinal control about the lateral axis) through the linkage of its four gyroscopes to the ailerons and elevators. It did not allow automatic control of direction or yaw (directional control about the normal axis) through the rudder. Electrical brushes mounted on the gyro- scopes' gimbals made contact with brushes fixed to the frames when the aircraft moved away from the fixed axes of the gyroscopes. The resulting electrical flow engaged electromagnetic clutches mounted on a main power shaft, turning reduction gearing in servomotors. The shaft received its power mechanically from a propeller or electrically from a generator spun by a propeller, depending on the model used. Servomotors manipu- lated the aircraft's control surfaces to return the aircraft to the fixed refer- ence planes established by the gyroscopes. In 1914 Lawrence Sperry took his device to Paris to compete in the Concourse par l'Union pour la Sécurité en Aeroplane.26 Sperry dazzled the judges by standing up and raising his hands from the controls, while his mechanic walked on the wing in an attempt to disturb the stability of the aircraft. The aircraft flew straight and level under the control of the Sperry automatic pilot, winning its designer the $10,000 grand prize.27 Lawrence continued to experiment with electrically driven servomotors to replace the 1914 version's air-driven motors, a single gyroscope to re- place the earlier version's four, an electromechanical model with improved electrical contacts, and a single gyroscope model using all-electric servos.
