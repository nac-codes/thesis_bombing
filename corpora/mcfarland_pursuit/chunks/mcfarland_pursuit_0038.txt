hit on its target, but required eighteen radio corrections from the chase aircraft. The Air Service certified Sperry's contract for payment in November 1922.35 Sperry shipped the completed aerial torpedoes to Langley Field for ser- vice testing, but the local commander refused to uncrate them, considering unpiloted aircraft a waste of money. Lawrence Sperry's death in December 1923 brought work to an end. In 1924 the Army lowered the priority of aerial torpedo work to concentrate on bombsight development. Insuffi- cient funds encouraged Henry "Hap" Arnold to cancel the project on May 13, 1932, clearing the way for manned, heavy bombers equipped with pre- cision bombsights to carry out the developing doctrine of daylight preci- sion strategic bombing.36 Ironically, the Army and Navy were then work- ing to merge the two technologies of bombsights and automatic flight control to improve bombing accuracy.37 World War I created the weapons of air power, but the urgency of war left little time for considering how to employ it. Early bombing was en- tirely tactical, adding close air support and interdiction to trench warfare. Bombing missions rarely went beyond 15 kilometers behind the front lines. The Germans initially and later the British introduced strategic bombing in a desperate search for solutions to the stalemate on the West- ern Front, but these efforts amounted to little more than harassing raids. Based in part on this limited precedent, the United States entered the war in 1917 with little idea of what air power could do in a war. The Air Service's Maj. Edgar S. Gorrell claimed 3,000 to 6,000 bombers could de- stroy German morale and bring surrender, but claims were not reality.38 The single American bombardment manual available for use during the war already assigned bombardment aviation a unique role. Its authors initi- ated two decades of sometimes acrid debate on the role of air power: should bombing attack the morale of troops at the front or the morale o
