, but damaged a granary, a vegetable storehouse, two private houses, a repair shed, and a hospital. American airman Capt. Bruce Hopper claimed bombing accuracy was only "occasional."43 In all, American bombardment forces dropped only 138 tons of explo- sives on enemy targets during the war, losing thirty-three bombers in com- bat. The first American day bombardment raid did not come until June 12, 1918, only four months before the end of the war. The American bombing survey after the war determined the effort had killed 641 and wounded 1,262, damaged 35.4 million marks of enemy property, and caused the enemy 204.7 million marks in direct and indirect costs. Accu- racy was so poor that the Army concluded "night bombing has usually been found to be more accurate than day bombing." The historian of the First Day Bombardment Group admitted its major contribution had been to serve as bait, keeping the Germans attacking group aircraft behind en- emy lines and by that action not attacking American observation aircraft over the front lines. "Because of the very small weight of bombs dropped and the crude bombsights of the day, little damage could possibly have been done by these handfuls of aircraft."44 The major lesson to come out of bombsight development during World War I was the need for greater accuracy, largely dependent on stabiliza- tion, and a plan or doctrine for aerial bombing. Other lessons were the need for efficient instruments to insure more precise flying, more uniform bomb ballistics, drift compensation, simplified operation, and optical mag- nification to allow missions at altitudes sufficiently high to escape from the dangers of antiaircraft artillery. Air power had not been decisive in World War I, but after the war nations looked beyond the trenches, to the prom- ise of airplanes and bombsights, for a means to overcome the quagmire of modern warfare.45  2 96 27 The Army's Pursuit of Precision Bombing The Army's Pursuit of Precision Bombing T he common a
