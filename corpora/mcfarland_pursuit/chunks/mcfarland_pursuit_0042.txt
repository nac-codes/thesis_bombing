prom- ise of airplanes and bombsights, for a means to overcome the quagmire of modern warfare.45  2 96 27 The Army's Pursuit of Precision Bombing The Army's Pursuit of Precision Bombing T he common and consistent goal of the Army's airmen in the 1920s was to develop an air force that could overcome the hor- rors of World War I's trench warfare. For some the solution was to return mobility to the battlefield, using aircraft as mobile ar- tillery in close support of American ground forces fighting against enemy ground forces or to interdict the battlefield. A few dreamed of flying over the enemy's defending armies and navies, using aircraft to drop bombs on the sources of the enemy's war-making power. Improved bombing accu- racy was the ingredient essential in both for the successful application of air power. The Dickman Board, appointed to analyze the lessons of World War I, set the tone for the postwar development of air power in 1919, concluding "nothing so far brought out in the war shows that aerial activities can be carried on, independently of ground forces, to such an extent as to affect materially the conduct of the war as a whole."1 Army field regulations made the air force subordinate to ground elements, assigning aerial bom- bardment the tactical duties of ground-strafing or close air support and of battlefield interdiction, striking at lines of communication, supply depots, bridges, and railroad facilities "beyond the effective range of artillery."2 The chief of the Air Service established the Field Officers School at Lang- ley Field, Virginia, in 1920, renamed the Air Service Tactical School in 1922 and the Air Corps Tactical School in 1926, to formulate an air doc- trine for the proper use of air power. That doctrine, the system of prin- ciples and ideas that would guide Air Service functions, made air power an auxiliary in support of infantry, the "Queen of Battles."3 The Morrow Board, assembled in 1925 to study air power, also saw aircraft used in th
