hat would guide Air Service functions, made air power an auxiliary in support of infantry, the "Queen of Battles."3 The Morrow Board, assembled in 1925 to study air power, also saw aircraft used in the role of low-altitude tactical ground support: "The next war may well start in the air but in all probability will wind up, as the last war did, in the mud."4 This direct, but restricted, role required bombsights of limited sophisti- cation. Fluid battlefield conditions and the proximity of friendly forces dic- tated low-altitude daylight missions close to the front. Enemy defenses dictated night missions behind enemy lines. Both translated into an air force of light and medium bombers of limited range and bomb-carrying capacity flying at altitudes under 8,000 feet. The Tactical School taught that "bombardment never makes a diving attack" to remain above the dan- ger of antiaircraft defenses.5 The Army's Bomb Board, in hearings held from August to November 1919, concluded that "the most important problem" in developing bomb- ing was the acquisition of a good bombsight. It recommended the develop- ment of gyroscopic stabilization, because of the limited efficiency of pen- dulums damped by dash pots (shock absorbers), based on a 1916 Army research project that revealed the greatest single cause for bombing error to be the oscillation of airplanes in flight. The Army transferred responsi- bility for bombsight development from its Ordnance Department to the newly established Airplane Engineering Department at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio (renamed the Engineering Division in 1918 and the Mate- riel Division in 1926). In 1927 bombsight research moved with the Mate- riel Division to a permanent home at Wright Field near Dayton.6 The starting point for the bombsight project was the World War I Wimperis. The Mark I Army Wimperis required different scales for each bomb, could not be used at night, was not stabilized, could not find ground speed, and could only be used flying direc
