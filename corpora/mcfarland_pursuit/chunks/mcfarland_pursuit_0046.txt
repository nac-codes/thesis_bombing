tical bombsight using Sperry equipment and employees.10 Seversky described his C-1 bombsight as highly accurate and com- pletely automatic, with the exception of drift control. It employed a gyro- scopic compass separate from the bombsight and a transmission system to pass compass data to the bombsight calculator. A gyroscope found the absolute vertical under the aircraft, but did not stabilize the device. Sperry had to use profits from his commercial ship stabilizer and gyrocompass business to pay for development in light of deep cuts in Army research funds. The Army warned Sperry not to proceed because it had doubts about the Seversky design: "The price you have quoted is considered entirely unreasonable and it has been decided to test out the Seversky bomb sighting system in an airplane before proceeding with the expenditure of any more funds." After three years of work at Sperry, Seversky completed a working C-1 for Air Service testing in August 1924.11 It required three crew members. The observer used a telescope and gyrocompass to trans- mit azimuth and elevation information to the bombardier. The bombar- dier operated the Seversky calculator to solve the bombing problem, com- bining ground speed (calculated using the timing technique), altitude, ballistics information from charts, and the gyroscope to determine the true vertical baseline. He plotted an interception course and transmitted flying instructions to the pilot. Although the Engineering Division deemed it better than any other available sight, mechanical failures caused "many wild errors." Maintenance problems with its fifty-five major subassemblies demanded "daily remedying." It also needed so much electricity that two propeller-driven generators had to be installed under the test aircraft's wings and two additional batteries installed in the fuselage. Extreme sensi- tivity to currency fluctuations meant the aircraft had to be flown at a pre- cise speed to achieve the exact flow of current from the
