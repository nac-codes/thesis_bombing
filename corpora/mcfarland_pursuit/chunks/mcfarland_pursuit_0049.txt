-the-art bombsight design, reducing the required time for straight and level flight from nearly a minute for other timing sights to only 20 seconds, minimizing exposure to ground fire. It also reduced the number of scale settings the bombardier was responsible for from four to one.17 At McCook Estoppey worked to improve the design. The D-2 was a D-1 with an automatic timing device. The Engineering Division paid $4,680 for an experimental model and $6,980 for two production models from the Pioneer Instrument Company of Brooklyn in 1925.18 The D-3 was a D-2 with gyroscopic stabilization in place of the pendulum stabiliza- tion of the D-1 and D-2, designed at the Sperry Gyroscope Company in 1924 and 1925. The Army paid $9,000 for two prototypes plus $1,185 for Sperry's drawings. Although tests were successful, the D-3 was of insuffi- cient value for standardization.19 More successful was the D-4, a D-1 with heavier construction and an improved internal timing mechanism. The stronger design was due to the Aberdeen tests of the D-1, which raised doubts about its durability "under exceptional rough usage in the hands of enlisted men who use the bomb sight bracket for a step in getting in and out of the cockpit." Still stabilized with a pendulum, it permitted the bombardier to preset the altitude and direct the pilot to fly straight over the target. Because it was so similar to the previous D-series sights, tools and dyes already existed and insured a price of only $1,100 for the first three prototypes from Gaertner Scientific Corporation of Chicago in 1925. Continued problems with the stabilizing system prevented standardization and the Air Corps deemed the sight too complex "to be worthwhile because D-4 soon to be replaced." The re- placement was later than sooner, however, forcing the Army to purchase 230 D-4s for use in various aircraft over the next five years. Needing a low-altitude sight to replace the Mark III, the Navy purchased forty D-4s at the reduced price of
