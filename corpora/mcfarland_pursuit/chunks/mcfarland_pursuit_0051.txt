up to a maximum of $7,500, but only after he left government service. This he did in July 1926, with the promise that royalties would be due him for any of his inventions procured after his separation. This agreement brought him $2,887 in 1927 and $2,600 in 1932.24 In 1932 Estoppey focused his litigious attentions on the Navy, claiming that the Navy's Norden Mark XI bombsights "clearly fall within the disclo- sures and scope of my patents." The Navy's BuOrd decided that the Mark XI employed "a means of operating a sighting member which appears to be similar to the means of sighting from a moving body, on a stationary target." The Navy had purchased the Norden Mark XI timing bombsight for sighting from a moving body on a moving target, but agreed to pay Estoppey $2,000 for patent 1,296,640. In violation of government pro- curement laws, the Navy had previously promised to protect the Carl L. Norden Company from such patent infringements.25 Estoppey was not finished with the Army. In the desperate period of America's entry into a new world war he would again call on Washington with an inexpensive, stopgap bombsight (the D-8).26 Capt. Henry B. Inglis left the Air Service in September 1920 to become an "aeronautical mechanical engineer" at McCook Field's Engineering Di- vision in charge of bombsight development. The Engineering Division credited him with being "probably the best versed in the United States in this special field." Inglis claimed responsibility for recommending to Estoppey the timing method that the latter would use on the D-3 bomb- sight, which he also claimed to be a "joint invention of Mr. Estoppey and myself."27 With the limitations of the D-3 apparent from testing at McCook, In- glis initiated a program to develop a low-level ground-attack bombsight, the K-1, based on the designs to which he had been exposed in his position. In August 1926 Inglis applied for a patent for his low-altitude automatic bombsight, which he never received because the ideas
