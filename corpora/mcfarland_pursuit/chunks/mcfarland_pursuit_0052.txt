K-1, based on the designs to which he had been exposed in his position. In August 1926 Inglis applied for a patent for his low-altitude automatic bombsight, which he never received because the ideas contained in the K-1 were similar to previously awarded patents or were commonly known mechanical principles. The Air Corps never put the K-1 into production. Inglis also worked on his L-1 high-altitude sight, based on the prin- ciples of the D-3 and C-1 bombsights, but equipped with the synchronous method of ground-speed determination and an automatic bomb release. In February 1928 the Air Corps Bombardment Board recommended the production of six L-1s for testing, approved by the chief of the Air Corps one month later. Before the L-1 contracts could be completed, however, Inglis resigned at Wright Field and went to work for the Sperry Com- pany-a case of the "revolving door" in military procurement common in the history of bombsight development.28 Like Estoppey, Inglis hoped to profit from his inventions. At Sperry he helped Seversky with his C-type bombsight and worked on the engi- neering data and specifications for the L-1, to be delivered to the govern- ment at no cost in anticipation of an Air Corps order for mass production of the L-1 upon completion.29 In April 1929 the Air Corps issued a con- tract to the Sperry Gyroscope Company for the construction of but five L-1 bombsights, at a cost of $40,000, with the Army providing optical sys- tems and gyroscopes to Sperry at no charge.30 Sperry delivered the first two sights to the the Materiel Division for testing in September 1930. A "gyro-stabilized, vertical seeking, synchronous range determination, fixed telescope with a rotating prism, automatic electric and manual release" bombsight, it bore a resemblance to the Sperry C-4, but weighed 50 pounds less.31 After the Sperry Company completed its contract in July 1931, the Ma- teriel Division reported "inferior accuracy" and an unsatisfactory "pilot directing system
