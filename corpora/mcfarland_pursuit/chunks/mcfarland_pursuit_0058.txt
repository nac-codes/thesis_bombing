Engineering Division's Maj. Clin- ton W. Howard and Sperry vice-president Thomas A. Morgan.41 Lack of funding and Air Service priorities prevented earlier action.42 Morgan in- formed Howard of Sperry's continuing work on automatic flight control and announced his wish to "cooperate with you in every way possible." Shiras A. Blair, who in 1912 had flown with Lawrence Sperry in a Curtiss flying boat equipped with the world's first gyrostabilizer, also helped get the two sides together. During the period of the autopilot project he was an Air Corps captain stationed at the Engineering Division/Materiel Divi- sion first at McCook Field and then Wright Field. Elmer A. Sperry Jr., brother of Lawrence Sperry, who had died in 1924, completed his work on the yaw or directional aspect of the autopilot prob- lem in May 1926.43 The Air Service began testing the prototype, the A-1, at McCook Field later that month. Three years of modification followed before final testing began in the summer of 1929.44 Trouble with the Ford C-9 test-bed aircraft delayed work, but on October 4, 1929, under the careful supervision of Elmer Sperry Jr. and officials of the Stout Metal Company of Dearborn, Michigan, a division of the Ford Motor Company, the world's first successful fully automatic pilot flew through rough air "without anyone in the pilot's cockpit."45 Although Lawrence Sperry had understood how to control pitch and roll almost two decades earlier, Elmer Sperry Jr.'s contribution was con- necting the rudder and ailerons to control yaw. In his patent Sperry ex- plained: The importance of the aileron control has heretofore not been recog- nized because it has not been appreciated that the actuation of the aile- rons is not merely for the purpose of imparting stability to the aircraft but that the ailerons play a very definite role also in controlling the direction of the aircraft. ... I have recognized this situation and have provided an inter-connection between the aircraft wings and
