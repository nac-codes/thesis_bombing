pump drew air through two ports in the casing of the gyroscopes across vanes attacked to the gyro- scope wheel, spinning it at high speeds. Deviation from level flight shut off the air flow through one port, increasing the pressure on one side of a diaphragm inside an air relay. The relay operated an oil valve that engaged a hydraulic servo and piston to adjust the aircraft control surfaces and re- turn the airplane to level flight. Sperry's second modification allowed the A-2 to maintain a constant altitude. An additional diaphragm remained open to atmospheric pressure until the aircraft reached its desired altitude. Any change in altitude after the inlet valve had been closed caused the diaphragm to expand or con- tract. Its movement changed the flow of air from the air pump across an attached disc, which adjusted the elevator control system of the automatic pilot through a bellows. This feature was critical for accurate bombing, because as a bomber dropped its first bombs, the lightened aircraft tended to leap upwards, upsetting the bombsighting solution for the remaining bombs.51 The success of the A-2 was solidified in 1933 when the famous aviation pioneer Wiley Post flew his Winnie Mae around the world, New York to New York, solo, in 115 hours, 361/2 minutes. Post had paid Sperry $10,000 for an early model A-2, without which his flight would have been impos- sible. Elmer Sperry Jr. tore up the check when Post landed in New York. Weighing only 75 pounds, including a gallon of hydraulic fluid, the auto- matic pilot had arrived. It equipped the pioneering Boeing 247D commer- cial transport, ancestor to the B-17 Flying Fortress of World War II. A generation of wartime American airmen would know the A-2 by the affec- tionate nickname of "Elmer," the device that flew "more planes than any man who ever wore pilot's wings."52 The A-2 gave the Air Corps an automatic pilot, but the problem of bombardier-pilot communication remained. In 1926 McCook's Henry In- glis had
