more planes than any man who ever wore pilot's wings."52 The A-2 gave the Air Corps an automatic pilot, but the problem of bombardier-pilot communication remained. In 1926 McCook's Henry In- glis had suggested connecting a bombsight, in the fashion of the Norden Mark XI, to the PDI to allow the bombardier to signal the correct course directly to the pilot by adjusting the bombsight's controls. Although still relying on a human pilot, it was a step toward having the bombardier fly the aircraft. When Alexander de Seversky proposed to design and build a C-1 bombsight for the Air Corps in a letter of August 2, 1926, Inglis en- couraged him to include an attachment to go one step further and allow  Chapter 2 40 The Army's Pursuit of Precision Bombing the C-1 sight to detect and correct errors automatically by maneuvering the aircraft's control surfaces. Negotiations for this Seversky Automatic Azimuth Drift Control floundered, however, on Seversky's demand for a $10,000 payment for the idea. The Air Corps refused to pay for something its own Engineering Division had originated.53 Mortimer F. Bates of the Sperry Gyroscope Company sought patent protection in October 1929 for his design linking the A-1 autopilot to the C-series bombsights. His design put the steering of the aircraft "directly under the control of the bomber [bombardier] at the bomb sight [and] . . . to steer the dirigible craft in the act of sighting upon a target."54 Turning the idea into a workable device proved difficult and by 1933 the lack of funds, the realization that the Sperry C-series bombsight project was going nowhere, and the rumored accuracy of a new Norden bombsight forced the Army to bring all bombsight development projects to a halt, including attempts to link bombsights and automatic pilots. Automatic pilot work continued, but mainly as a device for long-range navigation and safety in poor weather. A decade of expensive research and development had left the Army's air force with many odds
