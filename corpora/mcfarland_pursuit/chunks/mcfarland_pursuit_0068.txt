nced Thorpe that the new Norden bombsight was per- haps the most accurate bombsight in the world. It had "not been seen by  Chapter 2 44 any one at the [Materiel] Division, and, therefore, the comparative merits of the four sights [C-4, D-7A, C-5, and the new Norden] are not known."68 Should the Air Corps rework the Estoppey D-7 into a refined D-7A, try to rescue the much-delayed Sperry C-5, go with the Sperry C-4s already contracted, or buy the Navy's new Norden bombsight?69 For fiscal year 1933 the Air Corps allocated $325,000 for bombsights to equip a new generation of bombers.70 A decade of effort left it with only marginal capabilities, many untested. Chief of the Air Corps Benjamin Foulois had seen enough. He notified the division that he was diverting $223,000 for aircraft procurement, leaving just $102,000 for bombsights. That amount, he said, must be used to purchase only the new Norden bombsight.71 Foulois' decision left no funds for examining any new Sev- ersky, Estoppey, Inglis, or Sperry designs. On November 15, 1933, the Air Corps informed all four sources that it had "no expectation of procuring any quantity" of their bombsights other than those already contracted. Since Riley Scott's pioneering work in 1910, the Army's air force had man- aged to accumulate 12,124 World War I Mark I-As, which it could not discard because there was "no other available sight"; 68 D-1s and 107 D-4s in operational units; and 6 L-1s, 3 D-4As, 1 D-7, 3 C-4s, 1 C-5, and a Norden Mark XI undergoing testing. On order were 7 C-5s ($6,500 each), 26 C-4s ($5,500 each), and 25 new Norden bombsights ($4,500 each). The Materiel Division was also attempting to manufacture small numbers of D-7As ($2,500 each) for low-altitude use at Wright Field with Air Corps materials, tools, and employees.72 The bombsight development program had become an embarrassment. Henry H. Arnold, commander of the 7th Bombardment Group, com- plained that he had to throttle-back his B-12 bombers during bombing
