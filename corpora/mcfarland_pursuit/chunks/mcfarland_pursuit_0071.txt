He intended to shorten wars and reduce casualties by improved bombing accuracy, allowing airmen to target specific military and industrial targets. (Source: Norden Systems Division.) A The first attempt to link a bombsight and an automatic pilot to improve bombing accuracy, predecessor of the Norden and Sperry SBAE/AFCE, was this Sperry 1915 automatic pilot linked to a modified Wimperis Mark I bombsight from the early 1920s.

Clown Emmett Kelly presented Ted Barth, Carl Norden's production manager, an oversized pickle at a Madison Square Garden circus performed exclusively for Norden employees in 1943 to celebrate winning an Army-Navy "E" award for production excellence. The pickle came from Barth's claim that a Norden bombsight could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel from 20,000 feet. (Source: Norden Systems Division.) Carl L.

For the Navy, aircraft had to go to sea on the backs of expensive aircraft carriers with limited capacities. Land-based, long-range patrol bombers did not have the performance to follow the fleet to sea and were politically vulnerable to "turf" battles with the Army's air arm. Primary Navy targets were ships, difficult to hit because they could
