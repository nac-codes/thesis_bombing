crustiest shellback to recognize the importance of air power.2 A series of ship-bombing tests that caught the attention of the American public, choreographed by Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell, became the first post- war opportunity for naval air power. The Navy was in the midst of a series of ordnance tests against naval vessels and invited, under duress from Mitchell, the participation of the Air Service.3 From the beginning, Mitch- ell and the Navy were at cross-purposes. Mitchell wanted a forum for his ideas while the Navy wanted to evaluate the effects of bombs on ships. The Navy also needed a means for testing the effectiveness of its own nascent air force. If any ships were to be sunk by aircraft, they would be Navy air- craft.4 Through June and July 1921 Army airmen and Navy aviators dropped bombs on various targets, including a German submarine, destroyer, and cruiser and an old American battleship. Although they sank all, the two aerial forces did not distinguish themselves with bombing accuracy.5 The finale came on July 20 and 21 with strikes against the 546-foot German Ostfriesland. A modern dreadnought with watertight compartments (though anchored and with no defensive fire), bombing the former Ger- man battleship was a worthy test of the power of aerial bombardment. Bad weather and Navy and Air Service friction limited damage the first day. The Navy wanted to examine the ship after each attack, hoping to gather valuable data on the effects of aerial bombing on battleships. Mitchell wanted only to sink the German ship as fast as possible to prove the superi- ority of air power to sea power. On the first day the Navy dropped thirty- four 230-pound bombs, with six hits, and eight 550-pounders, achieving two hits. Mitchell's force added eleven 600-pounders with two hits. The Ostfriesland took on a slight list astern and had its port engine room flooded, but remained afloat at the end of the day. On day 2 Mitchell was an irresistible force. Before the Navy could
