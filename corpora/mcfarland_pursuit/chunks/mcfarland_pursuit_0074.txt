hits. The Ostfriesland took on a slight list astern and had its port engine room flooded, but remained afloat at the end of the day. On day 2 Mitchell was an irresistible force. Before the Navy could stop them to examine damage, Mitchell's crews dropped five 1,100-pound bombs, with three hits, holing the starboard side. Seven 2,000-pound bombs followed in quick order. At 12:25 one hit 25 feet from the port side. Three minutes later another hit five feet closer. The water-hammer effect split the Ostfriesland's seams. Eight minutes later the stern was under water. By 12:40 the once great ship was gone. The tests put to rest most doubts about whether an airplane could sink a ship.6 There was, however, nothing especially profound about aircraft dropping hundreds of bombs to sink immobile ships unprotected by anti- aircraft artillery. Sixteen Navy and sixteen Air Service aircraft had dropped 38,320 pounds of explosives on a defenseless battleship and had sunk it. The Joint Army-Navy Board, with John J. Pershing as the senior member, drew wide-ranging conclusions from the tests. Most seemed to be a sop to the Navy-the battleship remained "the backbone of the fleet and the bul- wark of the Nation's sea defense." Aircraft added to the dangers faced by battleships, but had "not made the battleship obsolete."7 It became an article of faith, though without serious examination until the 1930s, that bombing accuracy would be abysmal against a maneuvering ship, especially at the high altitudes from which antiaircraft fire would force airplanes to bomb. A report for the secretary of the Navy in Decem- ber 1924 concluded that "it is absurd to contend that either the aerial bomb or the submarine torpedo has furnished the effectual answer to the capital ship." The Army came to the same conclusion: "from 10,000 feet the chance of hitting a moving ship with those instruments [current bomb- sights], is extremely remote." The Navy continued to develop an air force because of the obvious
