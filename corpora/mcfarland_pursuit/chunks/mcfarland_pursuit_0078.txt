While at the institute he met a young Russian revolutionary, Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, known to history as Nikolai Lenin. According to Norden's son, both were "ruthlessly self-disciplined with outstanding powers of concen- tration" and a sense of destiny that drove them to great accomplishments. Both went on to find fame and fortune, one designing new technologies, the other leading revolutions. Although Norden was a Dutch citizen by birth, his family ties were to Germany. His father was a Dutch-naturalized German, his wife Austrian- German. He saw the world in mechanical terms, everything fitting to- gether in perfect harmony, like the gears of a watch. The greatest designs, he believed, were the products of mathematical formulas reflecting the natural workings of the universe. Norden typified the European tradition of skillful craftsmanship.

Despite this near reverence for German skills, Norden held Germans as a people untrustworthy.

Norden emigrated to the United States in 1904, "because that's where the jobs were." An American uncle, Adolph Norden, a rich cotton mer- chant, got him his first job with the Worthington Hydraulic Company. Clearly Norden hated working for others-a prima donna, he in rapid succession worked for Vehicle Equipment Company, Lidgerwood Manu- facturing Company, and finally Sperry Gyroscope Company in 1910. El- mer Sperry hired the Dutchman to solve problems associated with the gy- roscopic stabiliz
