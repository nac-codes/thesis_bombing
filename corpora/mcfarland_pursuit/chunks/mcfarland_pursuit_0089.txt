promises, the bombsight designers gave in and agreed to form Carl L. Norden, Incorporated, to fulfill the Navy's orders. Barth and Norden each owned 50 percent of the stock, originally valued at $6,000. Barth would be president and Norden a consulting engineer. Verbal agreements required both to produce Navy bombsights, with no other stockholders than Barth and Norden, to do no business with foreign countries, and to do no commercial business, under the supervision and direction of BuOrd.31 The Navy promised to provide the company with sufficient or- ders to keep it going. The final obstacle was Norden's demand for patent violation indemni- fication. Carl Norden operated under the constant threat of legal action from the Sperry Gyroscope Company. Elmer Sperry Sr. felt Norden had betrayed him when the latter left the former's service and claimed rights over any Norden designs using gyroscopes. When Norden agreed to pro- duce Mark XI bombsights for the Navy, the standardized military contract called for the contractor to "indemnify the United States and all officers and agents thereof, for all liability incurred of any nature or kind on ac- count of the infringement of any copyright or patent rights." Remember- ing Sperry's unsuccessful lawsuit against him in 1919 for infringing on a Sperry patent in the development of his ship stabilizer, Norden wanted the Navy to assume liability. On April 14, 1928, the Navy's judge advocate general declared that the liability clause in Norden's contract could be omitted if Norden assigned the patent rights to the U.S. government through the secretary of the Navy. The final contract of May 1928 called for the production of eighty Mark XI bombsights ($4,050 each) with PDIs, spare parts, and tool kits, for $384,800. Norden transferred all drawings, blueprints, vandykes, and pa- tent rights to the Navy two years later.32 Although Norden later claimed he had turned over all patent rights, models, and designs of his inventions to the go
