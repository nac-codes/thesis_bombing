For 10 years he had served as a consultant to BuOrd, averaging $7,800 per year, working on catapults, arresting gear, PDIs, bombsight stabilizers, and the Mark XI out of loft space at 74 Lafa- yette Street, New York City.

The Navy negotiated contracts with Norden that stretched or violated laws and regulations. Section 3709 of the Revised Statutes of the United  58 Chapter 3 59 To Sink Ships Table 3.1.

States, dating from the Civil War, required the military to advertise for all purchases and contracts and accept competitive bids. Congress added exceptions to the procurement law later, but none applied to the Norden case. In World War I purchasing officers could sign contracts witho
