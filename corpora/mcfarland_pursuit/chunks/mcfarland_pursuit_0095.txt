uAer concluded that the Mark XI "lives up to all expectations reasonably held for it during the first year of its use," though nagging problems continued. Slippage of the "back sight" was never solved and leveling remained the operator's greatest challenge. The bombardier had to remove his eye from the sight's telescope to see the timing mechanism, thus losing sight of the target. Its complexity forced the need for continuous expensive overhauls after only several hours of operation. The cardan bearings of the gyroscope tended to bind at the cold temperatures of high-altitude flight. And most telling, the Mark XI still forced pilots to fly prolonged bombing runs at a constant altitude and speed to achieve decent results, dangerous in combat.41 The Navy was not so confident of the Mark XI to give Norden monop- oly control over Navy bombsight development. In 1928 it paid General Electric of Schenectady, New York, $5,000 to study the feasibility of devel- oping an advanced high-altitude bombsight, the Mark XIII. Intending to counterbalance Norden, the Navy called the program "Bombsight- Scheme B." BuOrd judged Norden "a handicap to the Bureau in that the subject could not be pursued as actively and from as many angles as might be possible if the ideas for this development came from several sources." Attempts to interest the Ford Instrument Company were unsuccessful. General Electric initiated development in 1928. It built only one model, requiring $25,000 from the Navy and $53,000 from its own resources. After three years of development the Navy canceled the project because meanwhile Norden had developed a new bombsight so superior to the Mark XI that Navy concerns for an alternate source of bombsights with- ered away.42 Until this new bombsight was ready, the Mark XI would have to do. When compared to the Mark III, the Mark XI demonstrated a significant increase in accuracy. From an altitude of 6,500 feet, the Mark III averaged a circular error of 311 feet, while the
