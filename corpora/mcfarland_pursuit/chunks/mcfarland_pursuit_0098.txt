equipped with the Martin MBT (later the TM-1). Other land-based tor- pedo bombers followed, including the Naval Aircraft Factory's PT-1 and PT-2, which launched the Navy's first torpedo against a moving ship in 1922; the DT-2, manufactured by various companies; Martin's SC-1 and SC-2; and Douglas' T2D-1. Beginning in 1926 torpedo bombers went to sea on aircraft carriers with the Martin T3M-1 and T4M-1, Great Lakes TG-2, and the Douglas TBD-1 of wartime fame.48 The Navy's first operational aerial torpedo was the Mark VII, developed in 1917, weighing 1,000 pounds with a 280-pound warhead. Development of a successor, the Mark XIII, began in 1925, but it did not become opera- tional until 1936. An aerial torpedo weighing 2,200 pounds with a 600- pound TNT warhead (torpex in 1943), the Mark XIII routinely failed to detonate and had a restricted range of about 6,000 yards. Launching air- craft had to drop it from 80 feet of altitude at a speed of less than 100 knots within 1,000 yards of the target, requiring its crews to fly suicide missions. With a speed of 33.5 knots, the Mark XIIIs were barely able to catch the fast ships the world's navies were then building.49 The other means the Navy developed for sinking ships from the air was dive bombing. Its origins were more accidental than planned. Great Brit- ain issued a patent for dive bombing to an inventor named Von Willisch in 1911. The first recorded instance of dive bombing in war was in Mexico from 1913 to 1915, where an American mercenary pilot, Leonard W. Bonney, used "spherical bombs of dynamite" dropped during dives. In World War I French pilots dove to bomb German zeppelin hangars in the first month of the war. Most probably these instances involved glide bomb- ing (40 to 70 degrees from horizontal flight), not dive bombing (70 to 90 degrees from the horizontal).50 Dive bombing provided answers to the Navy's twin concerns of aircraft survivability and bombing accuracy-high altitude during penetration to escape s
