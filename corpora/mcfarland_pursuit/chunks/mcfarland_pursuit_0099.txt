bombing (70 to 90 degrees from the horizontal).50 Dive bombing provided answers to the Navy's twin concerns of aircraft survivability and bombing accuracy-high altitude during penetration to escape ship defenses and attain surprise, low altitude at the time of bomb release to maximize accuracy. The Marine Corps initiated the systematic use of dive bombing. In 1919 Lt. Lawson H. Mc. Sanderson and his air group, using DH-4Bs, be- gan experimenting with dive bombing in Haiti. Sanderson's tactic was to aim his aircraft at bandits at an angle of 45 degrees, which was a glide, not a dive, to improve bombing accuracy. Other pilots in his VO-9M squadron adopted the technique, later using "large canvas mail sacks" to carry the  64 Chapter 3 65 To Sink Ships bombs for dropping. Sanderson's men released their bombs during descent by pulling a draw rope around the end of the sack.51 The first organized dive-bombing attack was the action of five Boeing O2B (DH-4M) aircraft of the VO-1M squadron under the command of marine Maj. Ross E. Rowell on July 17, 1927, against Sandino forces sur- rounding a marine garrison at Ocotal, Nicaragua.52 The proximity of en- emy forces forced the attacking aircraft to drop bombs while in steep, true dives to improve flying safety, not bombing accuracy. Against intense ground fire from Sandino riflemen, the marine aviators averaged only one rifle fire hit per sortie. Rowell claimed he learned the technique from Army Air Service pilots of the 3rd Attack Group at Kelly Field, Texas, in 1923, while the Air Service claimed the skill came from the British in World War I.53 Although the battle of Ocotal was important in the history of American air power, dive bombing did not impress those under the bombs. Augusto CÃ©sar Sandino, leader of the rebel forces, did not mention the marines' use of air power in his account of the battle. Later, at the battle of El Chipote, Sandino did recognize the repeated dive-bombing attacks of Marine air- craft, concluding
