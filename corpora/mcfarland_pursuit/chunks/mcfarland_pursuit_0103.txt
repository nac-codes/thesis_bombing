ficient cool- ing, the supercharger allowed greater altitude, flaps provided increased lift on takeoff without increased drag in flight, the variable pitch hydraulic propeller increased efficiency both on takeoff and in flight, and the Na- tional Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) cowling increased en- gine cooling while reducing drag. All-metal stressed-skin monocoque con- struction and the internally braced fully cantilevered single wing, designed after NACA airfoils, gave strength with reduced drag and made other de- velopments cost effective. These included the enclosed cockpit, retractable landing gear, internal bomb bays, and flush rivets, all of which helped to reduce drag. Finally, 100-octane aviation gasoline based on tetraethyl lead and iso-octane allowed greater manifold pressures, giving more horse- power per pound of engine without knock, and allowed the supercharger to be used to boost power, not just altitude.60 These achievements allowed the Boeing B-9, at 188 MPH, to fly as fast as most fighter aircraft of the time. Sixty percent faster than the Keystone bombers of the 1920s, the 207-MPH Martin B-10 followed. Its major weak- ness, range, guaranteed a successor. And what a successor. The Boeing Model 299, designated the B-17 Flying Fortress by the Army, took advan- tage of the above technologies to become the preeminent platform for bombing of World War II. With turbosuperchargers and four Wright Cy- clone radial engines rated at 775 hp, one version could fly 2,400 miles with 4,000 pounds of explosives at 291 MPH, up to an altitude of 25,000 feet. The B-17's only apparent weakness was its cost, $99,000 each, which would limit Air Corps procurement until war opened congressional lar- ders. For the Navy the results were the Martin BM-1 and BM-2 in 1931- 32, which could carry 1,000-pound bombs and release them in dives, the Curtiss BF2C in 1933, the Northrop BT-1 in 1937-38, and the Douglas SBD in time for World War II.61  4 68 69 Norden Bombsigh
