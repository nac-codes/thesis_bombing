offi- cers with the fleet were demanding high-altitude sights because improve- ments in antiaircraft artillery were forcing aircraft ever higher. Finally, the Navy failed to consider the character of Carl Norden. Here was an engi- neer who believed his destiny was to design the most advanced bombsight in the world, not a mechanic hired to design a simple, crude utility sight. It was a less-than-auspicious beginning for one of the most important weapons of World War II. Lt.' Frederick I. Entwistle, BuOrd's new chief of bombsight develop- ment, recognized these factors and encouraged Norden to pursue a sophis- ticated Mark XV with dispatch. Norden had designed his Mark XI bomb- sight on the timing method as potentially the most accurate means of bombsighting, even if the most complex. Navy criticism of the Mark XI's complexity encouraged Norden to try the synchronous technique as a means of simplifying the Mark XV. In the synchronous method, the bombardier adjusted the speed of a wheel or gear in his bombsight mechanism to match the movement of the aircraft over a point on the ground. This technique synchronized the bombsight with the aircraft's ground speed, measuring the aircraft's move- ment at a particular moment relative to a fixed point on the ground. The timing method required a long bombing run because it measured a fixed point's movement relative to the aircraft as an average over an interval of time. The aircraft then had to fly at an unvarying speed, nearly impossible in combat, or the calculations of the timing technique would be thrown off. The synchronous bombsight precluded long bombing runs, measuring ground speed as an instantaneous rate, constantly updating the measure- ment. It also automated a critical portion of the bombsighting process- the determination of ground speed-eliminating human involvement and human errors in the timing procedure. In combat, under fire, bombardiers using the timing technique tended to rush the timing process, resulting
