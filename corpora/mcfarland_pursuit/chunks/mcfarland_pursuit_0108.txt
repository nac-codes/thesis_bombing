feature that eliminated human variability in pushing the bomb release but- ton. At 160 MPH, a bombardier dropping one second late would increase his bombing error by more than 200 feet. Dahlgren dropped eighty bombs using the Mark XV and forty landed within 75 feet of the target, achieving a circular error of less than 150 feet.6 Operators reported the synchronous Mark XV to be small, simple to operate, dependable, and with an auto- matic crosstrail correction.7 Testing ended in August 1931, when BuOrd issued a contract to Carl L. Norden, Inc., for a production model Mark XV at a cost of $10,000. Delivered to Dahlgren for contract completion testing in the summer of 1932, it proved 60 percent more accurate in range and 69 percent more accurate in deflection than the original test model. The commander of the Navy's torpedo squadron VT-2B asked for permission to use this produc- tion model Mark XV in a bombing exercise against the USS Utah sched- uled for October 1932. Curiously, BuOrd refused the request because "re- sults from it would probably be very disappointing"-a peculiar answer coming from an agency that was preparing to order volume production with $235,125 of the taxpayers' money. BuOrd's denial of the Mark XV for the exercise was a harbinger of the Navy's eventual rejection of high- altitude horizontal bombing in favor of dive bombing as a means of at- tacking maneuvering ships.8 The Dahlgren Naval Proving Ground reported accuracies never reached in operational use. It advanced various explanations for such in- consistencies, not including what may have been a case of the "revolving door" in military procurement. Dr. L. T. E. Thompson was chief physicist/engineer at Dahlgren from 1923 to 1942 and tested and approved the Norden bombsight. His signature allowed BuOrd to pay Carl Norden for his work. In 1942 Thompson left Dahlgren and went to work for Nor- den as vice-president in charge of engineering at the Lukas-Harold Cor- poration, a Norden subsidiary r
