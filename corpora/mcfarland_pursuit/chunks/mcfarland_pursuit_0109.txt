BuOrd to pay Carl Norden for his work. In 1942 Thompson left Dahlgren and went to work for Nor- den as vice-president in charge of engineering at the Lukas-Harold Cor- poration, a Norden subsidiary responsible for the Naval Ordnance Plant at Indianapolis. In 1945, when Lukas-Harold completed its contract, Thompson became the technical director of the Naval Ordnance Test Sta- tion at Inyokern, California, responsible for testing Norden equipment competing for naval contracts. Several years later Thompson returned to Norden as vice-president of the Norden Laboratories Corporation, suc- cessor to Carl L. Norden, Inc., and then vice-president for research of the Norden-Ketay Corporation, which succeeded Norden Laboratories in  72 Chapter 4 Norden Bombsight and Precision Bombing Doctrine 1955. In 1958 United Aircraft Corporation purchased Norden-Ketay and Thompson became a consultant for United's new Norden Division. If Thompson had used his position to insure the Mark XV became the Navy's bombsight, he was handsomely rewarded. According to Donald Ja- cobs, a postwar competitor of the Norden Laboratories Corporation, Thompson excluded major bombing errors from his calculations on accu- racy, using "trick tests and sympathetic mathematical treatment."9 Jacobs claimed the Norden bombsight was capable of accuracy only one-sixth that reported by Dahlgren. The wide difference between the bombing results of service units and Dahlgren provided Jacobs with supporting evidence. BuOrd's contract with Norden had specified a low-altitude bombsight, but Norden deliv- ered a high-altitude sight incapable of low-altitude bombing. Such prob- lems remained hidden behind the project's secrecy and the obvious superi- ority of the Norden over other bombsights.10 One of Entwistle's last actions before leaving his assignment as chief of bombsight research for BuOrd was scheduling a test of a production model Mark XI and the development prototype Mark XV against the anchored USS Pittsburgh.
