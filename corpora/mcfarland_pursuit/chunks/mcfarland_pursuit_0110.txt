before leaving his assignment as chief of bombsight research for BuOrd was scheduling a test of a production model Mark XI and the development prototype Mark XV against the anchored USS Pittsburgh. Ironically, the Navy intended to evaluate the effects of aerial bombs on a cruiser, not the effectiveness of bombsights. On October 6 and 7, 1931, in perfect bombing weather at an altitude of 5,000 feet, the Mark XI dropped fourteen bombs, achieving hits with three (21%). The Mark XV got four hits out of eight bombs (50%). Until the Pittsburgh test, the Navy had kept Norden's development ef- forts secret from the Army. In July 1931, to comply with federal law requir- ing open bidding on military procurement projects, the Army Air Corps contacted the Norden company with specifications for a new high-altitude bombsight based on the synchronous method. Norden's president, Ted Barth, expressed an interest in bidding on the project. Not until September 1931, on a visit to Wright Field, did Barth inform the Air Corps of Nor- den's new Mark XV bombsight.11 On October 5, 1931, Brig. Gen. Benjamin D. Foulois, acting chief of the Air Corps, wrote Rear Adm. William A. Moffett, chief of BuAer, and expressed a deep interest in the Navy Mark XV project. The Air Corps is experiencing considerable difficulty in developing a suitable bomb sight. . .. I have been informed that the Navy Bureau of Ordnance has undertaken a further confidential development, or im- provement, of the Mk. XI sight-known as the Mk. XV .... I would appreciate receiving such technical details as would assist us in this par- allel development and would also like to have two of my officers inspect the Mk. XV type sight and secure performance data in order that we may be in a position to more effectively determine our immediate and future procurements in bomb sights.12 Because of a recent exchange of information with the Army on bombsight development, BuOrd's Entwistle meanwhile had invited two Materiel Di- vision of
