ting telescope with an 18-degree field and 2.2 magnifying power, motor-driven to follow the target. Cross hairs etched on the lens transected the target, reflected into the telescope by a moving mirror.17 The mirror was "driven continuously by a constant speed electric motor coupled through a suitable tangent motion in such fashion that if the mirror speed is once adjusted to match the apparent motion of the target (ground speed of the bomber) the target will remain stationary on the cross-hairs." Light from a small elec- tric bulb entered the telescope through a narrow slit to illuminate the cross hairs for night operation. In the Mod. 1 (Navy)/M-1 through 3 (Army) versions, the bombardier "flew" the aircraft through an associated pilot direction indicator (PDI) transmitting signals to the pilot through a brush riding on a resistance coil. In all later versions the bombardier accomplished this step directly Â«rough the aircraft's automatic pilot. First the bombardier had to level his gyroscopes, because a tilt of only one degree toward the aircraft's rear from the true vertical could cause a bomb to fall over 400 feet short of its target from 20,000 feet (called "bubble error" because bubble levels were used to level the sight). In the second step the bombardier entered the bomb- ing altitude, bomb ballistics, air speed, air temperature, and barometric pressure into the bombsight, thereby setting the speed of a disc so that it revolved 881/3 times during the time required for the bomb to fall to the ground.18 This adjustment partially synchronized the movement of the telescope's mirror with the aircraft's movement over the ground. Next the bombardier "killed" drift caused by the wind, using the turn and drift knobs to fly the aircraft so that the target appeared to float down the verti- cal cross hair on the telescope lens. He "killed" rate by adjusting the rate knob to complete the synchronization of the telescope mirror and the movement of the aircraft relative to
