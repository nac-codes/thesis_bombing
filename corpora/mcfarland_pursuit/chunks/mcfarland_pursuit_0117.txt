xpected international con- ferences to outlaw the bombing of cities, but argued that "the destruction of manufacturing centers and material brings the conflict to a quicker ter- mination. Thus, manufacturing centers become military objects, even though they house non-combatant personnel." The purpose of strategic bombing was to interfere "with the manufacture of military equipment [by] hitting and destroying the factories, and . . . causing . . . such a nervous condition to obtain among the workers that their efficiency of production would be curtailed."23 Mitchell had little confidence in contemporary bomb-aiming technol- ogy. His solution was to organize bombers into formations, dropping on the command of the leader to achieve a "heavy collective effort." Mitchell was the best-known advocate of air power in the United States between the wars, but he was the champion of bombing in general, not precision bombing. He wrote of using poison gas, the penultimate area weapon, against cities and of poisoning water supplies from the air. For Mitchell, cities, not individual industries, were the vital centers.24 Also contributing to the debate over air power were various European strategists. The Italian Giulio Douhet saw trench warfare and the slaugh- ter of World War I as a "colossal tragedy, with the whole world for its theater and humanity for its protagonist," resulting from the ineptness of military leadership. In two books, Command of the Air, first published in 1921 and revised in 1927, and The War of 19-, published in 1930, Douhet offered strategic bombardment from airplanes as the solution to the ex- tended slaughter of modern war. Attacks on military forces, the focus of pre-airplane warfare, achieved nothing but an intensification of the car- nage in the trenches. The key, he argued, was to target civilians, who lacked the iron will of military men and were much more vulnerable to the  78 Chapter 4 Norden Bombsight and Precision Bombing Doctrine will-destroying
