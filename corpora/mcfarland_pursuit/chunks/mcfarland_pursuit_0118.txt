he key, he argued, was to target civilians, who lacked the iron will of military men and were much more vulnerable to the  78 Chapter 4 Norden Bombsight and Precision Bombing Doctrine will-destroying power of aerial bombardment. No longer was the destruc- tion of armed forces the objective of war. Now the target was "the enemy's will to resist."25 Although he did not specify area bombing, Douhet intimated that pop- ulation centers were the targets of choice, with communications, factories, airfields, arsenals, and ships as secondary targets. Bombing would wreck civilian morale and prevent industry from supporting armies in the field and navies at sea. After a few days, without the need for long, drawn-out conflict, the enemy would feel "definitely that they had been defeated in the air and that they were hopelessly at the enemy's mercy." Like Mitchell, Douhet justified attacking civilians because it would end war quickly.26 Douhet's faith in the war-winning power of the bomber mirrored an earlier generation's faith in the "unsinkable" dreadnought battleship. He had unlimited confidence in bombing. Bombers would always hit their tar- gets and achieve a uniform distribution of bombs-250 tons per square mile of urban area-to achieve absolute destruction.27 Aerial bombs have only to fall on their target to accomplish their pur- pose. Aerial bombardment can certainly never hope to attain the accu- racy of artillery fire; but this is an unimportant point because such accu- racy is unnecessary. Except in unusual cases, the targets of artillery fire are designed to withstand just such fire; but the targets of aerial bom- bardment are ill-prepared to endure such onslaught. Bombing objec- tives should always be large; small targets are unimportant and do not merit our attention here.28 Douhet misunderstood even the most basic elements of air power. He as- sumed that once command of the air had been established, the destruction of an enemy's industries and civil centers would
