111 and Do 17 bombers in level flight at 13,000 feet against Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers. The former dropped 2 percent of their bombs within a 330-foot circle, the latter 25 percent within a 165- foot circle. The Luftwaffe Operations Staff issued a "Statement of Technical-Tactical Requirements" in 1939 giving preference to "the devel- opment of bombsights specifically for dive-bombing operations over the development of multi-purpose bomb aiming devices." German strategic bombing doctrine for World War II was therefore to drop a few large bombs with great accuracy through dive bombing. The primary bomb was a 2,200-pounder with a thin, high-grade weldless casing and a TNT filling that made up 74 percent of the total weight. This contrasted with the American doctrine of dropping large numbers of smaller bombs, 500- pounders with a thicker, low-grade steel roller-produced tube casing and a TNT filling that made up 50 percent of the total weight.35 81 European air forces evolved bombing doctrines uniquely different from the daylight precision strategic bombing doctrine of the United States. Ac- cording to the Air Corps' Herbert A. Dargue, a major factor behind these differences was the unavailability in Europe of a precision bombsight simi- lar to the Norden. Dargue made eight trips to Europe during the 1920s and 1930s to check on "whisperings" that the British, French, and Ger- mans had developed super-accurate bombsights. Each time he discovered that the bombsights were only Wimperis, Michelin, or Estoppey sights. On a trip in 1936 the British showed Dargue their newest type-a modi- fied World War I Wimperis similar to the U.S. Navy's Mark III, obsolete in the United States for more than a decade. Because of inadequate bomb- sights, Dargue reported, the British were "resigned to the fact that hori- zontal bombing will be effective only against area targets." The French and Germans, because of the closeness of continental targets, were con- centrating on dive bombing.36 T
