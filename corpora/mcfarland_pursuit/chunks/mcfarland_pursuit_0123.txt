d to the fact that hori- zontal bombing will be effective only against area targets." The French and Germans, because of the closeness of continental targets, were con- centrating on dive bombing.36 These European views stood in stark contrast to a strong American con- viction against bombing civilians or civilian targets. During World War I Billy Mitchell of the Air Service planned to initiate long-range bombing attacks on Germany, but Secretary of War Newton D. Baker ruled that the United States would not begin "promiscuous bombing upon industry, commerce or population, in enemy countries disassociated from obvious military needs."37 Baker set the tone for the postwar debate in 1919 when he declared that bombing attacks on civilians "constituted an abandon- ment of the time-honored practice among civilized people of restricting bombardment to fortified places or to places from which the civilian popu- lation had an opportunity to be removed." Bombing civilians would be counterproductive, he said, because it would encourage others to unite against those who bombed civilians. Americans would not undertake such terror raids on "most elemental ethical and humanitarian grounds." Total war would be limited to soldiers at the front.38 Will Irwin, in "The Next War": An Appeal to Common Sense (1921), rein- forced Baker's pronouncements in arguing that bombers could turn me- tropolises into "necropolises" unless restricted. A Navy captain echoed these convictions before the Morrow Board in 1925 when he objected to the United States becoming a nation of "baby killers."39 These men reflected the sentiments of many Americans in opposing the mass bombing of civilians. They seized the moral high ground, intending to limit the Air Service to tactical strikes against enemy armed forces.
