Iron-  82 Chapter 4 5 ically, prohibiting the Army Air Service from bombing civilians uninten- tionally opened the way for the development of precision strategic bomb- ing because American airmen proposed to bomb machines, not people. These declarations aside, Americans had a "traditional reverence for marksmanship" and a deep-rooted opposition to making civilians targets in war. Opponents of strategic bombing argued the waste and inefficiency of bombing cities. A Harper's magazine article concluded that war could not "be won by attacking civil populations in cities," citing as evidence the German experience in World War I. Losing 350 airmen, Germany launched a bombing campaign against England, costing Germany $20,000 for each of the 1,200 English killed in the bombing. Despite Sherman's "March to the Sea" and America's war against Philippine insurgents, the men responsible for creating bombing doctrine never wavered from their conviction that civilians should not be the targets of strategic bombing.40 Perhaps the most significant obstacle to the development of a strategic bombing doctrine, however, was American isolationism. Strategic bomb- ing, whether of civilians or factories, was inherently offensive, which had no place in this climate. The purpose of the Army and the Navy, and any fledgling air force, was national defense. The Pratt-MacArthur Agreement of January 1931 assigned the Air Corps the responsibility for all coastal defense aircraft.41 When Congress established General Headquarters Air Force in 1935, it directed that the new organization concentrate on the defense of the United States, not offensive warfare. Airmen set their sights on offensive strategic bombing, but operated under the umbrella of de- fense for the remainder of the interwar period. While thinking about strategic bombing, airmen still had to heed the Army's official doctrine of close air support in the 1920s. Training Regula- tion 440-15 of 1926 identified close air support and the
