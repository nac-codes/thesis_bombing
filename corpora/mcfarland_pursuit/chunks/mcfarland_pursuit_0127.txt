suming "that if the advantages of precision bombing could be established in theory, American ingenuity and inventiveness would pro- vide the means for making such bombing possible in practice." Laurence S. Kuter recalled that he had based his thinking on the promised accuracy of a future bombsight that was only rumor at the time. Donald Wilson remembered that he "started teaching the theory .. . even before you had the means to do such a thing." Haywood S. Hansell Jr. reported that none of the theorists knew of the Norden bombsight and its capabilities until after they had left Maxwell's ACTS and returned to flying units. The com- mander of the 1st Bombardment Wing, Henry Arnold, did not report test results with the new Norden bombsight until late 1935, several years after these men had begun teaching their doctrine.4 Joining Walker in the formulation phase were Harold L. George, Muir S. Fairchild, Robert M. Webster, and Donald Wilson.5 According to Wil- son, no one had the freedom to change the old curriculum that taught that air power was auxiliary to ground forces until the arrival in 1934 of another key individual, the ACTS's new assistant commander, Herbert A. Dargue. Because the commander of the ACTS was the post commander, Dargue served as the head of instruction. The first man to transmit a radio message from an aircraft to the ground and to receive a radio message from the ground, he led the Pan-American Flight of 1926-27 and the Good Will Tour of seventy American cities in 1927. He came to the ACTS from a tour as commander of the Air Corps' premier bombardment group, the 2nd, at Langley Field. Perhaps most important, Dargue brought to Max- well Field a knowledge of and conviction in the value of the new Norden bombsight, based on a long and close personal relationship with Theodore H. Barth, president of Carl L. Norden, Inc.6 Together these men strove to perfect the doctrine of daylight precision strategic bombing. Where Mitchell had emphasized the morale
