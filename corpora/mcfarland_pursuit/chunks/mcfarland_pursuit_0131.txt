and "The Air Force" were the last before Walker and Wilson's influence became dominant. "Bombardment Aviation" identified the French and German night strate- gic bombardment of World War I as generally ineffective, largely because of bombing inaccuracy, but emphasized the success of British day bomb- ing. "The Air Force" identified winning control of the air over the battle- field as air power's primary function.13 The 1934 ACTS text was the first to emphasize daylight precision stra- tegic bombing, ranking the national will and industrial economy as more important targets than the enemy's armies. The 1936 ACTS text "Air Force, Part I, Air Warfare" asserted that the target of warfare was no longer just the Army, but the nation and its "vital centers": production centers, communication, and power plants, attacks on which would dam- age a nation's war potential and will to resist. In 1939 ACTS lecturers were telling their students that bombardment should be aimed at vital centers,14 not people, because attacks on civilians would have only "temporary ef- fects" on a nation.15 School instructors directed their students to study the American indus- trial fabric to identify choke-points, the kinds of attacks necessary to de- stroy them, and the effect their destruction would have on the American economy. In the early 1930s, before Walker and Wilson's influence, as- signed targets for study were bridges, railroads, roads, docks, and ships. After their influence students studied various targets in the industrial fabric of Pennsylvania, including rail terminals, electrical power plants, oil re- fineries, bridges, steel mills, dams, and the Philadelphia Naval Yard. Lau- rence Kuter and Harold George assigned students to look for the sensitive elements in New York City's infrastructure that could make the city unliv- able-water, electricity, and transportation. Research included aerial pho- tographs added by Herbert Dargue, a pioneer in aerial reconnaissance. Students learned
