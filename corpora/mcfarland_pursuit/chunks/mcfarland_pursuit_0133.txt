aiming was sufficiently accurate to destroy precision targets. These targets of the industrial fabric seemed large and easy to hit, covering tens of thousands of square feet, easily distinguishable from surrounding struc- tures. Air Corps annual bombing and machine gun matches at Langley Field in the 1920s should have given the theorists pause to reflect on bombing accuracy. With newer sights considered "about five times as accu- rate as those in use during the world war," and even at low altitudes, the results hardly justified the Tactical School's faith in strategic bombing. The average radial error from 5,000 feet was 173.8 feet, 282.6 feet from 8,000 feet.19 The largest bomb in the Army inventory, 2,000 pounds, could cause a crater no larger than 22 feet in diameter with an instantaneous fuze and 50 feet with a delayed fuze. The maximum effective range of fragmenta- tion was 110 feet. At the lower altitude of 5,000 feet at the annual matches, even this largest bomb would be ineffective. In July 1926 the Air Corps received a firsthand lesson in the importance of accuracy when lightning struck the Naval Ammunition Depot at Lake Denmark, New Jersey. Exploding shells struck the nearby Army Picatinny Arsenal. A watchman 1,500 feet from the arsenal was only slightly wounded when 775,000 tons of TNT exploded. Accuracy was clearly more important than the size of the bomb. Tests done in the late 1930s con- vinced planners that "it is better to attack more objectives or to obtain a better chance of hitting by dropping a larger number of the proper size bombs than it is to drop fewer bombs of a size larger than necessary." Be- fore the war the Air Corps determined that the 500-pound bomb was the Table 5.1.
