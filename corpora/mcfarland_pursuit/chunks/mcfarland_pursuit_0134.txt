One study evaluated the requirements for destroying the Sault Ste. Marie locks between Michigan and Ontario. Engineers reported nine 300-pound bombs, carried by one medium bomber, would do the job-if bombing was accurate. Such studies re- inforced the Air Corps' commitment to daylight precision strategic bombing.21 From 1930 to 1938 the Air Corps dropped over 200,000 bombs in train- ing. The overwhelming majority of these drops came from 4,000 to 11,000 feet, dictated by prevailing tactics and gasoline shortages. Less than 3 per- cent came from above 16,000 feet. This data provided Laurence S. Kuter, an instructor at the ACTS, the information for creating the probability studies on which the bombing doctrine was based (see Table 5.1).22 Although impressive, these results showed that bombing was accurate only in excellent weather against a clearly outlined, undefended target in the middle of wide-open terrain. New technology obscured these limita-  96 Chapter 5 97 Air Corps Adopts Bombing Strategy tions and continuing accuracy problems. From 1934 to 1936 Henry H. Arnold and his 7th Bomb Group and later his 1st Wing put this technology and high-altitude bombing to the test with Norden-equipped Keystone, B-9, and B-10 bombers at
