. His group was the first to fly the B-17 Flying Fortress equipped with the Norden bombsight. Olds's group experimented with blind bombing techniques to overcome the detrimental effect of clouds on the visual Norden bombsight. Called "bombing through overcast," Olds and his bombardiers flew by dead reckoning from a visible initial point to the obscured target. Measuring the distance from the initial point to the target on maps, the bombardiers calibrated their sights and used stop- watches to determine the time needed to fly the appropriate distance. The 2nd Bombardment Group achieved reasonable accuracy by this method, with errors of 1,200 to 1,800 feet in range and 500 to 700 feet in deflection common. Olds discovered, like Arnold before him, that strategic bombing Table 5.2.

In the six months before Pearl Harbor, bom- bardiers dropped nearly 50,000 bombs on practice targets. At an average speed of 170 MPH and with no drops from above 20,000 feet, not one group, on average, could achieve the standards set in Training Manual 1- 250 for first-, second-, or third-class bombardiers. This was in perfect weather against no enemy defenses. The Army Air Forces Board con- cluded in its report to Arnold, now chief of the Army Air Force
