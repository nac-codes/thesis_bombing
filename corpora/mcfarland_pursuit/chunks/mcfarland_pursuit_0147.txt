alue of high-altitude bombing, but high-altitude bombing was inherently inaccurate. His logic could not overcome the obstacle of bombing accuracy not yet achieved by Air Corps bombsights. The Norden-aimed bombing of the USS Pittsburgh in Octo- ber 1931 was too late to support Walker during the formulation and pro- mulgation stages of his ideas. Walker initiated the doctrine of high-altitude daylight precision strategic bombing based on a confidence in bomb- sighting technology that had not yet been achieved. He would have been the fool if Carl Norden's bombsight had not pushed that technology to a higher level. The idea gave purpose to the means and the means gave life to the idea.54 The Victor Adding Machine-manufactured Norden M-9 bombsight, mounted on top of stabilizer.
