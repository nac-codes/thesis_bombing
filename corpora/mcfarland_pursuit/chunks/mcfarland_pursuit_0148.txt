(F)  Calculator for Seversky C-1 bombsight. The gears, arms, motors, and disks of this device demonstrate the analog nature of bombsights before the development of electronics. Each component as it moved or rotated represented the analog of one of the mathematical formulas in the bombsighting equation.

Jez The 1933 Sperry A-2 automatic pilot that allowed Wiley Post in the Winnie Mae to fly around the world, solo, in just over 115 hours. In World War II "Elmer," as the A-2 was affectionately known, flew "more planes than any man who ever wore pilot's wings." (Source: Sperry Gyroscope Company Collection, Hagley Museum and Library.)

Mitchell proved airplanes could sink ships if they could be hit, intensifying the effort to improve bombing precision in both the Army and Navy. (Source: USAF Historical Research Agency.)  The first 600-pounder dropped on the Pee Dee River Bridge missed by several hundred feet on December 22, 1927. Poor bombing accuracy sparked a crisis in the Air Corps, prompting Air Corps Chief Maj. Gen. James Fechet to admonish the Materiel Division: "I cannot too strongly emphasize the importance of a bomb sight of precision, since the ability of bombardment aviation to perform the mission of destruction is almost entirely dependent upon an accurate and practical bomb sight."
