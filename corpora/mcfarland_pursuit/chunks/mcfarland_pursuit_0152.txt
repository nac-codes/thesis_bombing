, close enough to have a water-hammer effect. In two days of bombing, the Air Corps, using the Navy's Norden bombsight, had achieved a hit rate on a ship underway at sea of 11.9 percent.30 Bombing tests revealed the operational limitations of the technology and doctrine. The Air Corps believed improved training, salvo bombing,  100 Chapter 5 101 Air Corps Adopts Bombing Strategy and blind-bombing techniques would make daylight precision strategic bombing possible. On the eve of World War II, however, official doctrine in the Army's air force continued to emphasize defense and close air sup- port. The official doctrinal statement of the Air Corps was Training Regu- lation 440-15, dated October 15, 1935. Entitled "The Employment of the Air Forces of the Army," it was still in force at the outbreak of World War II. TR 440-15 placed all air forces under the control of the field com- mander and assigned them tactical duties "in direct or indirect support of other components of the Nation's armed forces." Specific functions were reconnaissance, interdiction, air superiority over the battlefield, and at- tacks on ammunition dumps, supply centers, and troop concentrations. Similarly the Joint Army-Navy Board of 1935 saw the Air Corps as an "arm of the mobile Army, both in conduct of air operations over the land in support of land operations and in the conduct of air operations over the sea in direct defense of the coast." The Air Corps Board of 1936 reflected this view, writing that "the diversion of effort incident to preparations for strategically offensive operations is not justified." Army Field Manuals 1-5, "Employment of Aviation of the Army," and 1-10, "Tactics and Techniques of Air Attack," made no significant changes to the planned employment of American air forces when they appeared in 1940. The mission of the Air Corps was to defend the United States and its overseas possessions, support the Army, and be prepared to deal with "other situations" that might arise.
