o raise to 90 percent the probability of destroying a target. The AWPD group multiplied this figure by the square of 2.25 to reflect the influences enemy defenses, weather, and combat conditions might have on accuracy. These calculations gave the planners the requirement for 1,100 aircraft or thirty group missions to destroy a target. They assumed each group of thirty-six bombers could mount eight missions per month. "To wage a sustained air offensive against German military power" was a matter for the adding machines.36 From these calculations the planners determined the number of bom- bardiers, pilots, navigators, mechanics, instructors, trainers, and aircraft that were needed to fight the war. Against Germany, this task required, by the AWPD's calculations, 98 groups (6,834) of heavy and medium bomb- ers, backed by a reserve of 1,708 bombers and replacements of 1,245 each month. Given the weather in Europe, they estimated this force would re- quire six months to do the job. The plan made no provision for an offen- sive against Japan. To man Norden bombsights, AWPD/1 required the training of 8,125 bombardiers. AWPD/1 would be the blueprint for Amer- ica's air war. Product of this hurriedly assembled planning group, it was at once testimony to the American doctrine of daylight precision strategic bombing. In the minds of the writers of AWPD/1 and of the Army Air Forces leadership, daylight precision strategic bombing could best defeat Germany and Japan, from high altitude, in level flight.37 The American air war in World War II was the fruit of six staff officers working with adding machines in extreme heat and humidity, largely with- out intelligence information, divorced from the exploding bombs, burning fuel, smoke, and torn flesh of war. They based their calculations on prac- tice bombings flown in clear weather and at low altitudes. Practice bomb- ings were one bomb at a time, making multiple passes to achieve higher accuracy. In wartime, enemy defenses would
