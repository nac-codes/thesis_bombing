ns on prac- tice bombings flown in clear weather and at low altitudes. Practice bomb- ings were one bomb at a time, making multiple passes to achieve higher accuracy. In wartime, enemy defenses would make such practices impos- sible. AWPD/1 used no information from foreign agents and little knowledge of the structure of the German industrial economy other than what the British provided to Hansell during a trip to England in the summer of 1941. To provide a "sense of reality," the planners named specific indus- tries, which, according to Hughes, was "unnecessary and impractical." The AWPD plan called for an all-out bomber offensive from April to Septem- ber 1944, based on intelligence gathered before the war. George, Hansell, Hughes, Kuter, Moss, and Walker perceived an inflexible, unchanging in- dustrial mesh incapable of repairing itself as its choke-points were de- stroyed. The German economy of 1944 would be dramatically different from this hypothetical German economy of 1941. It would prove through- out the war its ability to repair and expand itself under a barrage of Allied bombs. America's air war planners did not foresee dispersal, Minister for Armaments and Munitions Albert Speer's reforms, the incorporation of much of Western Europe's industrial might into the German war econ- omy, the utilization of millions of contract and slave laborers, and the transformation of Germany from a predominately consumer economy with surplus capacity in 1941 to a primarily war economy in 1944. The plan had many faults, not the least of which was the way in which the AWPD had formed it. According to Hughes, "In retrospect it seems fan- tastic that the air power program for the United States of America for World War II should have been based on the arbitrary and hurried opin- ions of two junior reserve Captains."38 Carl Norden's bombsight had yet to drop a bomb in anger, but AWPD/1 would have to serve as America's blueprint for World War II until wartime experiences required
