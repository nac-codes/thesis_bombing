four aircraft squadrons: one squadron of VBFs (fighters with dive-bombing capability), two squadrons of VSBs (scout bombers with dive-bombing capability), and one squadron of VBs (dive bombers) or VTBs (torpedo bombers). The VBs were to carry 1,000-pound bombs. The VTBs would be capable of carrying torpedoes or 1,000-pound bombs, to be dropped from high altitude using Norden bombsights. 12 Fleet Exercise 74, April 1938, was the culmination of dive bombing in Navy plans. The Lexington's dive bombers attacked three.cruisers and the battleships Tennessee and Oklahoma with "nearly total surprise" and against ineffective antiaircraft fire. Five minutes later the Lexington's torpedo bombers struck at the Tennessee and Oklahoma against "heavy and effective" return fire from the battleships. The Saratoga's dive bombers attacked sev- eral cruisers and the battleship California with complete surprise. Torpedo bombers from the Saratoga confronted heavy antiaircraft fire. The Ranger's aircraft attacked three cruisers, repeating the experiences of the two other strikes. Shore-based PBYs and VPBs bombed the Tennessee and New Mexico horizontally from above 10,000 feet against heavy fire. In analyzing the exercise, the Navy expressed extreme concern about the survivability of horizontal and torpedo bombers. Without testing the accuracy of bombing, the fleet commander concluded that he would not be able to defend his ships against a dive-bombing attack. Together, surviv- ability and accuracy spelled an end to the Navy's reliance on high-altitude horizontal bombing with the Norden bombsight.13 . The Navy retained the Norden bombsight and a horizontal-bombing capability for its land-based patrol bombers because of the unsuitability of dive bombing for long-range aircraft of this type. Admirals could have less accurate long-range horizontal bombing from land or more accurate short-range dive bombing from carriers at sea, but not in the same aircraft. Also preserved was the capability
