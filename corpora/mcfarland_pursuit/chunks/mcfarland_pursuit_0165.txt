t knew flying and knew bombing. A decade of tests and exer- cises proved them irrepressible and their tactic irresistible, though dive bombing never completely supplanted the other two bombing techniques in Navy use. When the United States went to war in 1941, the Navy hedged its bets. J  111 Navy Adopts Dive Bombing 110 Chapter 6 Table 6.1.

The irony was the failure of the U.S. Navy to use its own Norden bombsight, developed at great expense, in World War II. The U.S. Army, which did use the Norden bombsight, had to subordinate its needs for the device to those of the Navy for more than a decade. It had spent two decades developing three techniques for sinking ships from the air and it was unwilling to give up on any of them. Navy carriers carried Douglas TBD Devastators, dual-purpose torpedo bombers equipped with Norden bombsights for horizontal bombing; Vought SB2U Vindicators, dual-purpose scout aircraft capable of dive bombing; Grum- man F4F Wildcats, dual-purpose fighter aircraft capable of dive bombing; and Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers. The Ranger, because of its small size, was an all-dive bomber ship. At the
