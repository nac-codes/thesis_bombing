ces over the Norden bombsight. Confusion reigned over exactly how many were needed. In November 1938 President Roosevelt told his military commanders to work toward an Air Corps of 20,000 aircraft, though before Congress in January 1939 he lowered the figure to 3,000. In April 1939 Congress raised that number to 6,000. With the German invasion of France in May 1940, Roosevelt set 50,000 aircraft as the annual goal of America's aircraft production. In the fall of 1941 the six officers of the Air War Plans Division required a bomb- sight for each of 10,837 heavy bombers, a monthly production of 1,260 for replacement bombers, and thousands more for medium bombers, for trainers, and to meet Navy requirements. Roosevelt raised production goals in January 1942 to 60,000 aircraft for 1942 and 125,000 for 1943. No one knew how many bombers would be needed, but the two government agencies charged with bombsight procurement, the Navy's BuOrd and the Army's Materiel Division, knew Carl L. Norden, Inc., producing an aver- age of only 108 Mark XV Norden bombsights per year from 1931 through 1938, could not meet the demand (see Table 7.1). One major obstacle to the incorporation of the Norden bombsight into the Air Corps was security. The Navy classified the bombsight and "all correspondence and conversation relating thereto" as secret, requiring "every precaution in order to prevent information regarding this develop-  114 Chapter 7 115 Preparation for War Table 7.1.
