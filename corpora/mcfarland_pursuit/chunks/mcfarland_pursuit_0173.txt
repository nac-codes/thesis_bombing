of his reports having dealt with union activities, not espionage.12 Germany had already acquired plans to the bombsight through the ac- tivities of Hermann Lang, who had begun working for Norden as a me- chanic and draftsman in 1936. In July 1940 the FBI learned that the Ger- man Abwehr spy agency had contacted Lang and ordered him back to Germany to complete the basic plans he had stolen earlier. FBI activities included placing an agent in the apartment under Lang's but failed to un- cover sufficient evidence to arrest him for espionage.

In response to pleas for clemency, Judge Byers said, "He of all men k
