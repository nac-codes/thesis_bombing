y and Norden were at the front of bombsight development. Distrust between the two sides prevented any cooperation to merge the two technologies. The Air Corps therefore worked to link Sperry bomb- sights and autopilots through the Sperry Gyroscope Company and one of its engineers. Mortimer F. Bates's 1926 bombsight and his bombsight- autopilot combination of 1929 were the first successes of the Army pro- gram. The device distinguishes from all previous arrangements wherein the bomber oper- ated an indicator near the pilot of the craft to indicate to the latter the desired direction, and the pilot then steered the craft accordingly. By this invention the pilot is relieved of the duty of steering the craft during the time of sighting and alignment on the target, and the alignment is accomplished more quickly and more effectively. Although Bates's bombsight was inferior to the Norden Mark XV, he had pioneered the incorporation of the autopilot into the bombing process.20 The Navy's program grew out of a visit of BuOrd's Lt. Arnold J. Isbell to Wright Field in February 1932 to examine the Army's D-7, L-1, and C-4 bombsights. He discovered the Army was working to link the Sperry A-1 autopilot and the General Electric automatic steering control to bombsights, based on Bates's design. BuOrd received Isbell's report on Wright Field's work and Lt. Cdr. Malcolm F. Schoeffel immediately con- tacted Carl Norden about developing what the Navy called the stabilized bombing approach equipment, or SBAE, to improve the accuracy of the Norden Mark XV bombsight.21 Sperry patents already covered aspects of autopilots and bombsight-autopilot combinations, restricting Norden's options. Because Sperry and the Army had given up on the A-1 autopilot with its mechanical linkages in favor of the A-2's hydraulics, Norden had free rein to install mechanical linkages in his SBAE. Fortuitously strong- willed Carl Norden had a predilection for the quicker and more accurate responses of mechanical
