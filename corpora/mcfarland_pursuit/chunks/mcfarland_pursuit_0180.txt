rfaces until the gyroscopes precessed back to their horizontal or vertical positions. As a bombing device, the SBAE transferred any adjustment of the bombsight's controls through mechanical linkages to the azimuth gyro- scope, establishing the electrical currents necessary to initiate the ailerons and rudder, allowing the bombardier to fly the aircraft in roll and yaw. No  122 Chapter 7 123 Preparation for War connection between the bombsight and the flight gyroscope was necessary because the bombardier did not alter the pitch of the aircraft, which was automatically kept in level flight by the flight gyroscope. To encourage the services to buy the SBAE, then undergoing tests, Norden offered the Air Corps and the Navy the option of buying future SBAEs for the 153 Norden Mark XV bombsights then under order for $2,400 each. BuOrd agreed to the option in June 1935, despite reports from Dahlgren questioning the device's complexity, failure to operate the rudder properly, defective proportional banking feature, ruggedness, and dependability. By the time BuOrd allowed the Air Corps to test the SBAE, the option had run out and the Air Corps had to pay more than $3,000 per SBAE. Norden completed two production models in late 1936, one for the Army and one for the Navy, but BuOrd decided to keep both for Navy use, concluding that it was not in the Navy's interests "to let the Air Corps have one of the production models."29 After production began in June 1937 at a rate of seven to ten per month, BuOrd agreed to release one for Army testing. Ted Barth decided, however, that the action would interfere with production for the Navy and the Army's first acquisition was post- poned for another year.30 Security restrictions interfered with incorporation of the SBAE into Air Corps use as they did with the Norden bombsight. The Navy classified not only the device but the name "SBAE" confidential, interfering with such everyday Air Corps activities as advertising for bids on aircraft.
