they did with the Norden bombsight. The Navy classified not only the device but the name "SBAE" confidential, interfering with such everyday Air Corps activities as advertising for bids on aircraft. To escape these restrictions, the Air Corps adopted the unclassified name "au- tomatic flight control equipment" (AFCE) when referring to the Navy SBAE. It took the Navy four years to accept the Air Corps' argument that security restrictions were inhibiting aircraft manufacturing plans. In April 1941 the Navy reluctantly downgraded the SBAE from confidential to re- stricted. An observer could only wonder if both services were serving the same country.31 By 1937 Wright Field's efforts to connect the Norden bombsight with the Sperry A-2 autopilot had gone nowhere. Efforts to connect Sperry bombsights to the Sperry A-2 autopilot were more successful, but left the Air Corps with inferior bombsights. The Air Corps had little choice but to go with the Norden SBAE, to decrease bombing errors, decrease the length of bombing runs, allow the bombardier to undertake evasive ma- neuvers to the target, and reduce the training required for novice bombar- diers. It also had to continue to purchase Sperry autopilots because of the SBAE's inadequacies in directional control and because of the jarring ride the SBAE's mechanical linkages provided. The first SBAE-equipped Nor- den Mark XV bombsight appeared on an Air Corps aircraft (the B-18 bomber), also equipped with a Sperry A-2 autopilot, in June 1938.32 Adding 126 pounds of SBAE to allow an aircraft to serve as a bomber was wasteful and inefficient when the autopilot could perform the same functions as the SBAE, though perhaps not as effectively.33 Even Navy units complained. Patrol Squadrons 7 and 43 built their own adapters to allow the Sperry autopilot to be used with the Norden bombsight, though the commander of the Aircraft Scouting Force expressed concern that bombing accuracy would deteriorate if the Sperry autopilot replaced t
