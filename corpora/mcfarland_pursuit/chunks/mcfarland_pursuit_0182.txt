Sperry autopilot to be used with the Norden bombsight, though the commander of the Aircraft Scouting Force expressed concern that bombing accuracy would deteriorate if the Sperry autopilot replaced the Norden SBAE. Patrol Wing One wanted the Sperry autopilot because it was more rugged and reliable, less expensive (in 1940, $3,000 compared to $4,200 for the Norden SBAE), more amenable to quantity production, lighter by 50 pounds, created no security problem, and required less main- tenance.34 BuAer ruled that twin-engine patrol aircraft only had room for one and they would get the SBAE. Four-engine aircraft could carry both and would get both. Chief of Naval Operations Stark ordered the fleet to use the SBAE, asserting that the "effectiveness of the SBAE is solely a matter of proper adjustment and intelligent use." Dictums from on high could not cor- rect the problems users experienced, however. The Navy had temporarily solved the problem by deciding to do nothing.35 The Army could not equivocate. It needed an autopilot that could serve both functions. Every pound of extra equipment meant one less pound of explosives in Air Corps bombers. Operational units and Wright Field engineers spoke with one voice in their dislike for the Norden SBAE. The complaints were constant: the SBAE caused skidding in turns, gave a ride too rough for the crews, and failed to work effectively at high altitudes and at low speeds. The SBAE's "very high" maintenance and training require- ments caused nightmares among Air Corps planners. Requests that the Navy and Norden modify it to meet Air Corps needs went unanswered, largely because "Old Man Dynamite," according to BuOrd's Cdr. Malcolm Schoeffel, would never agree to change it.36 One problem with the SBAE proved unsolvable and insured the Air Corps would pursue a replacement. Norden had designed the SBAE with long steel cables connecting servomotor drums to aircraft control surfaces. Cables could experience a 140-degree drop in temperatu
