April 1941, but could not make it work. Sperry designed its autopilots to receive direction instructions by rate signal, while Norden designed its bomb- sights to send direction instructions to the SBAE by displacement signal. BuOrd again tried to scuttle the project, claiming that the results did "not indicate the need to replace the Norden SBAE with the Sperry automatic pilot at this time," but in a major policy reversal decided not to object to the adapter. The Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia solved the signals problem and reported excellent results from the revised adapter, though a human pilot had to control the ailerons because of the absence of a propor- tional banking feature. Dahlgren completed bombing tests in late August 1941 and the Naval Aircraft Factory began construction of forty adapters for service testing in September, completed in December, at approximately $750 each. 40 In January 1942 BuAer recommended to the chief of naval operations that the SBAE be eliminated in favor of the A-3 autopilot and Naval Air- craft Factory adapter, judging the SBAE "superfluous." BuOrd disagreed but did not block the measure. The Bureau of Supplies and Accounts noti- fied Norden in May 1942 that all remaining SBAE contracts would be for skeletonized units only, still needed to connect the Norden bombsight to the new Naval Aircraft Factory adapter and Sperry A-3 autopilot. The complete Norden SBAE served into 1944, however, because of A-3 shortages.41 While the Navy pursued the Naval Aircraft Factory's adapter, the Air Corps sought a different solution. Carl Norden, "adamantly a mechanical engineer," refused to consider electronic components to correct the SBAE. In mid-1941 the Army Air Forces asked the Minneapolis-Honeywell Reg- ulator Company of Minneapolis to design a new AFCE with electronic parts to link the A-3 autopilot and the Norden bombsight without the need for the Naval Aircraft Factory's mechanical-electrical adapter.
