design a new AFCE with electronic parts to link the A-3 autopilot and the Norden bombsight without the need for the Naval Aircraft Factory's mechanical-electrical adapter. In a rush to complete the project, engineers removed the gyroscope from a Norden SBAE and installed it in a reworked A-3 autopilot, replacing the hydraulic units with electrical drive. Wright Field found the results suffi- ciently impressive ("installed easily, turned perfectly, useful for both bomb- ing and navigation, and didn't require large numbers of skilled personnel") to order preparations for mass production of the hybrid system in October 1941, designated the C-1.42 Wright Field ordered 9,000 AFCEs equipped with Minneapolis- Honeywell electronics in May 1942. The C-1 became the standard bomber autopilot/AFCE/SBAE for the remainder of World War II, con- sisting of Minneapolis-Honeywell's new electronic adapter combined with the flight gyroscope and stabilizer of the Norden SBAE-what the services called a "skeletonized SBAE."43 It had at least three other advantages over the Norden SBAE. Norden had designed his SBAE with motors having a maximum pull of 350 pounds. The Army Air Forces's larger bombers, including the B-29, B-32, and B-36, needed 600 pounds of pull to move their rudders-a power built into the C-1. Its electronic components op- erated much faster than the mechanical components of the Norden, pro- viding up to 300 flight corrections per minute. Finally, its electrical cables connecting the central unit to the servomotors at the control surfaces were less vulnerable to enemy fire than the SBAE's long cables. More than a few bomber crews owed their lives to pilots able to fly their aircraft home by the C-1's controls after their regular aircraft control cables had been shot out. 44 BuOrd was not finished with its obstructionism.
