antiaircraft artillery gunners; an auto- matic erection system (AES) that would automatically level the bomb- sight's gyroscopes instead of forcing the bombardier to level them manu- ally using bubble levels; a low-altitude bombing attachment (LABA) for bombing runs below the standard minimum altitude for the Norden bombsight; an improved stabilization system to allow greater evasive ma- neuvers during the bombing run; an increase in voltage from 12, the Navy standard, to 24, the Air Corps standard; and a change from direct to alter- nating current.47 These requests created six additional opportunities for strife between the Army and Navy. The Navy was de-emphasizing the technique of dropping bombs on maneuvering ships from high-altitude horizontal flight and saw no need for expensive improvements that would interfere with Carl Norden's other projects for the Navy. Although Norden believed the GBA and AES were possible, BuOrd informed the Army that development would be at the ex- pense of bombsight production.48 That Norden went ahead with the re- quested improvements was testimony to the tenacity of Air Corps officers, especially Henry Arnold. When the Army asked for more sensitive alti- meters, air speed indicators, thermometers, and especially an electrically 127 Preparation for War operated automatic bomb release assembly, the Navy responded with de- lays and obstructions. Not until February 1937, five years after the Army first requested changes, did the two services agree to consolidate perfor- mance requirements. Barth's plan was to make only minor adjustments to the Norden bomb- sight, what Barth called "band aids," while Carl Norden worked on a "Uni- versal Bombsight," Navy designation Mark XVII, that would meet all Army needs. Norden never completed his "Universal Bombsight," leaving improvements in the accuracy of daylight precision strategic bombing to come from band-aids for the Norden Mark XV.49 The first band-aid was the Mark XV Mod. 2 (Navy)/M-4 (Ar
