ersal Bombsight," leaving improvements in the accuracy of daylight precision strategic bombing to come from band-aids for the Norden Mark XV.49 The first band-aid was the Mark XV Mod. 2 (Navy)/M-4 (Army) Norden bombsight with a new pilot direction indicator and two attach- ments not completed in time: the LABA and the SBAE/AFCE. The Mod. 3/M-5 had an improved tachometer. Norden added improved optics (in- creasing magnification from 1.4× to 3× for altitudes up to 30,000 feet), and improved forward vision for low altitudes to the Mod. 4/M-6 model, raising the unit cost to $6,010, up from $4,993 for the Mod. 3/M-5 ver- sion. The SBAE/AFCE added $3,890 to the cost.50 The next improvement was the Mod. 5/M-7, the last Navy model. With the GBA, LABA, and AES, the Mod. 5/M-7 was the most complicated Norden bombsight ever built. The LABA allowed greater disc speeds for low-altitude bomb deliveries.51 After two years of development and two and one-half years of testing and modification, Carl Norden produced the add-on LABA too late to be included on the Mod. 2/M-4 as planned. Pro- duction of the LABA-equipped Mod. 5/M-7 began in 1938 at the in- creased price of $7,100, $10,990 with the SBAE. Navy units reported the attachment to be "additional gear and served no useful purpose." In 1941 Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Harold Stark declared the LABA not practical for use, but BuOrd continued production because it had no other bombsights for use at low altitudes.52 The Air Corps used the LABA because it had no other "means for readily indicating to the bombardier a solution of dropping angles" for low-altitude bombing. By 1942 Wright Field had modified the Type E-6B computer, essentially a circular slide rule, to allow it to calculate dropping angles for low-altitude missions, making Norden's LABA superfluous. The Materiel Division requested it deleted at a "considerable savings of mate- rial and skilled labor." BuOrd notified all concerned that it had stopped production of the
