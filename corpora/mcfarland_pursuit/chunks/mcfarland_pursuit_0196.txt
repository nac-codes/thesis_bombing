ction immediately. Unfortunately it was too late. The Navy had eighty Mod. 4s on order and the Army 469, and it would be months before these prewar orders were ready. In Norden's defense, it made little economic sense to expand production to hundreds of bomb- sights per month when the company had orders for only 549. The Phony War in Europe after the conquest of Poland encouraged BuOrd to drop production from a planned 120 per month to 100 per month.67 Germany's invasion of France in May 1940 exposed this lack of prepara- tion, especially after Roosevelt announced his 50,000-aircraft plan. Brig. Gen. George Brett, chief of the Materiel Division, notified BuOrd that the Air Corps would need 316 bombsight/SBAE combinations in 1941, 3,645 in 1942, 5,000 in 1943, and 5,115 in 1944, plus 10 percent in spares and parts each year. Brett recommended that BuOrd establish new plants in more secure locations. This BuOrd refused to do, but Norden agreed to raise production back to 120 per month. Two months later Barth agreed to increase production to 400 per month, but only after BuOrd provided a letter of intent to purchase 4,800 bombsights.68 As war raged in Europe and the Pacific, a shortage of machine tools, caused by America's rearmament effort, thwarted BuOrd and Norden expansion plans. Barth blamed the Army for failing to provide his company with adequate orders to justify expanding productive capacity. BuOrd blamed Barth's "complacency," dictatorial air, and poor management. The Air Corps blamed Barth and BuOrd. In March 1941 BuOrd took charge and forced an expansion program, intended eventually to produce 800 bombsights and SBAEs per month. This included $8,525,000 for a new U.S. Naval Ordnance Plant at Indianapolis, to begin production in Sep- tember 1942. The Army thanked the Navy for its efforts, but pointed out that it needed 4,513 M-7 bombsights. Production would lag behind needs until April 1942 if the Navy's expansion worked according to plans. In April 1941 the
