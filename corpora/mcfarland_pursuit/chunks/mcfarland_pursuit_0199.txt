y is injurious to the interests of National Defense." As evi- dence of Navy-Norden negligence, he cited the Air Corps' request for price quotations on 319 bombsights submitted on January 30, 1939. The Navy returned the quotation on May 8. Eight days later the Army ordered the sights, but BuOrd failed to present the contract to Norden until August 13, 1939, eight months after initiation. Kenney refuted Norden's defense that it could not expand production because of the lack of contracts. 135  136 Chapter 8 137 Procurement for War Table 8.1.

As funds became available, in 1941 the Army ordered 4,065 bombsights on March 5, 520 on March 14, 273 on May 21, 4,513 on July 23, 2,374 on September 4, 80 on December 12, 664 on December 18, and 1,405 on January 1, 1942.1 Surging production of lend-lease bombers for America's allies and me- dium bombers for the Army Air Forces left the Materiel Division desper- ate for bombsights. The Norden production shortage plus the Navy's re- fusal to allow Allied nations access to the Norden bombsight forced it to contract with the Gaertner Scientific Corporation of Chicago for eighty redesigned Estoppey D-4s. Lacking a pilot direction indicator and an AFCE (automatic flight control equipment) link, the D-4B proved inade- quate for modern ai
