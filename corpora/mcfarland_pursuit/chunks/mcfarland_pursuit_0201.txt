Navy Secretary Frank Knox certified the agreement in a letter to Secretary of War Henry Stimson on January 18, 1942, and promised to divide Navy production with the Army on a 50/50 basis. BuOrd withdrew its permission on February 24, 1942, however, fearing that competition for scarce resources would create chaos. Mindful of Norden and Barth's opposition, and wanting to maintain con- trol over all production, the Navy met with Army Air Forces and Norden representatives to hammer out an arrangement on February 27, 1942. Wright Field would continue to submit all requests to BuOrd, which would place orders with Carl L. Norden, Inc. Norden would then farm out the contracts. The Cardanic Corporation, a Norden subsidiary, would handle Army Air Forces orders, produce bombsights for the Army Air Forces, and act as a communication channel between the Army Air Forces and Norden. The Army Air Forces would also seek its own source for bombsight production, coordinated through Cardanic.
