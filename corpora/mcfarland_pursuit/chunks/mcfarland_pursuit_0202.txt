All others for bombers assigned the most critical missions. American lend-lease bombers for Great Britain would get the Mark XIV/T-1, the Soviets the D-8 (see Table 8.2).4 Norden's Cardanic Corporation, named after the cardan ring around a gyroscope, allowed the Army Air Forces more direct contacts with Nor- den, while keeping it at the arm's length Norden and BuOrd wanted.

Wright Field representatives contracted for the Burroughs Adding Machine Company of Detroit to produce 1,000 Norden bombsights per month at approximately $5,000 each as a Cardanic subcontractor. Prob- lems in collecting the necessary machinery delayed production until late 1942, despite the intervention of Gen. William S. Knudsen of the War Production Board. Once production began, the unit price exceeded $7,000.5 Because Burroughs had more machines and a trained workforce, it re- ceived priority over Cardanic in starting production. Mismanagement and Norden's weak commitment to its subsidiary caused the War Production Board to judge the Cardanic situation "well nigh hopeless" in April 1943. Cardanic had fewer than one-third of the machines it needed for meeting production goals and operated only one shift of 100 workers. Worse, the management had not yet placed orders for many machines it needed. Ac- cording to an Army Air Forces investigative team, the president of the Cardanic Corporation had never even visi
