orkers. Worse, the management had not yet placed orders for many machines it needed. Ac- cording to an Army Air Forces investigative team, the president of the Cardanic Corporation had never even visited his bombsight plant. It was supposed to represent Army Air Forces's interests, but when Cardanic con- tracted with Robbins and Myers for 1,000 bombsight stabilizers and 2,500 servomotor sets, BuOrd canceled the order. The Navy would allow the Army Air Forces and Cardanic only what was left over after Robbins and Myers had satisfied Navy contracts.6 In May 1943 the Army Air Forces decided that "Cardanic's usefulness in the present picture is purely that of being a vehicle through which engi- neering information, designs, and subcontracting on certain facilities is made easier." Cardanic had served as little more than a paper corporation responsible for diverting Army Air Forces complaints and for providing technical representatives to help units in combat zones. In the summer of 1943 the Army transferred the Burroughs plant to Navy control and disbanded Cardanic under orders from the War Production Board to elim- inate excess facilities.7 The Army Air Forces continued searching for an independent manufac- turer capable of producing Norden bombsights for the Army free of Bu- Ord obstruction. After investigating four other companies,8 the Army se- lected the Victor Adding Machine Company of Chicago, with plans to begin production in November 1942. Victor, the Navy complained, would interfere with production by competing with Norden for parts, but the Army Air Forces refused to back down. The Navy also claimed that Army production plans for Burroughs and Victor, 5,700 per month, were in ex- cess of needs, especially because Norden had set up additional production lines at 50 Varick Street in New York, Lukas-Harold in Indianapolis, and Remington Rand in Elmira, New York.9 The development of the Minneapolis-Honeywell C-1 automatic pilot  140 Chapter 8 141 Procurement for
