The Navy tried to take over C-1 AFCE production, arguing before the Army-Navy Munitions Board that Minneapolis-Honeywell's effort duplicated work and facilities the Navy al- ready possessed for SBAE manufacture. Learning from a decade of experi- ence with BuOrd and Norden to defend its use of independent manufac- turers of AFCEs, Wright Field allowed the Navy to talk directly to Minneapolis-Honeywell. "All Army Air Forces requirements," however, would be "met first, and the Army Air Forces reserve the right to take all of the Minneapolis-Honeywell production regardless of Navy commit- ments if and when it should be necessary."10 BuOrd was too busy expanding Norden production to do much about the AFCE situation. In addition to the six companies involved in assem- bling bombsights, it had to coordinate three dozen additional firms pro- ducing parts and components, including everything from wire, ball bear- ings, washers, screws, and cotter pins to commutators, resistors, and Alemite fittings. The Norden bombsight, born of construction by Old World craftsmen to destroy the industrial fabrics of enemy nations, be- came itself the product of the American mass-production industrial fabric.11 Despite this impressive expansion, Army Air Forces's frustration with the Navy's handling of Norden bombsight production grew. Airmen gen- erally accepted BuOrd's explanations of sluggish expansion, but could not accept the Navy's continued hogging of available production. At a meeting with the Navy on November 11, 1942, the Army Air Forces presented two major complaints. First, the Army was using every Norden
