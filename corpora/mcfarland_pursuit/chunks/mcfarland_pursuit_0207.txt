This simple change in procedure eliminated a time-consuming step and was critical to meeting the Army Air Forces's growing appetite for Norden  142 Chapter 8 Procurement for War Table 8.3.

The only source for precision ball bearings was the Atlas Ball Bearing Company of SKF Industries, New York City, which was overwhelmed with orders in 1942. Norden and Barth established the Barden Precision Bearing Company (named from the first three letters of Barth's last name and the last three of Norden's) in Danbury, Connecticut, but the shortage continued until April 1943.16 The Army Air Forces pursued an additional source of bearings for its Victor bombsight factory through the New Departure Division of General Motors, Bristol, Connecticut. In a repetition of the obstruction Wright 143 Field met at every stage of bombsight procurement, SKF refused to discuss specifications with General Motors without BuOrd's permission. BuOrd delayed two months before approving the transfer of manufacturing data. SKF then provided inadequate information, making initial New Departure production unsatisfactory. The Army Air Forces had to order Victor to produce its bombsights with greater tolerances than stated in Norden specification
