ights were "inferior ... as to accuracy but also as to tactical value." The S-1 would be a new bombsight, but Barth believed any Sperry design to be little more than a "slightly modified L-1 with perhaps a different coat of paint." Barth sought the assistance of his old friend, Air Corps colonel Herbert Dargue, to fight off the Sperry challenge and get "Air Corps Bombardment Activities on a clean, wholesome basis ... through the use of the best available equipment, the maximum proficiency and efficiency in the art of bombing."19 So desperate was the Air Corps that it ordered 295 S-1s at $20,000 each  144 Chapter 8 145 Procurement for War in 1940 before Sperry had delivered prototypes for testing. Derived from the Sperry N-1 and O-1 bombsights, the S-1 was a gyroscopically stabi- lized synchronous bombsight with an associated Sperry A-5 AFCE. The chief of the Production Engineering Section at Wright Field predicted that if tests were successful, "it is likely that the shift to exclusive use of the Sperry bombsight and pilot equipment on all future bombardment type aircraft ... will be made."20 Needing bombsights and frustrated with the slow pace of Norden production, Wright Field ordered 930 additional S-1s in January 1941 for $5 million and 105 in July 1941 for free in ex- change for twenty N-1s and fifty-nine O-1s in storage.21 The Army Air Forces went ahead with Sperry production despite tests revealing optical vibrations and sensitivity to power fluctuations, critical in a bomber with power turrets. In June 1941 the Air Corps authorized Sperry to construct a 186,000- square-meter factory at Great Neck, New York, to manufacture 5,500 S-1s plus spares for $45 million. Because Sperry was occupied with other military projects, Wright Field arranged in 1942 for International Business Machines of Endicott, New York, to manufacture 3,725 S-1s and for National Cash Register of Dayton, Ohio, to manufacture 6,000 S-1s- contracts worth $33 million and $49 million respective
