nal Business Machines of Endicott, New York, to manufacture 3,725 S-1s and for National Cash Register of Dayton, Ohio, to manufacture 6,000 S-1s- contracts worth $33 million and $49 million respectively. It also contracted with Sperry, AC Spark Plug of Flint, Michigan, and Electric Auto-Lite of Toledo, Ohio, to build nearly 36,000 A-5 automatic pilots to serve as AFCEs to the S-1. The contracted price varied from $16,000 to $18,000 for each S-1/A-5 combination.22 The S-1 left a mixed record after two years of use in training and com- bat units. Training units liked the S-1 because its automatic erection sys- tem (AES) relieved bombardier students of the need to level the bomb- sight.23 Combat units found the S-1 bombsight/A-5 AFCE combination never worked properly. After an examination of Norden production and a comparison of all data on the Norden M-series and the Sperry S-1, an Army Air Forces Board of Officers recommended in September 1943 the standardization of the M-series bombsight and cancellation of all Sperry S-1/A-5 combination contracts. The board found the Norden superior in accuracy, more dependable, and "far superior" in operational design. Ar- nold approved and the Army Air Forces so notified Sperry in November 1943, after having invested over $100 million in S-1 production.24 When production ended in February 1944, contractors had produced 5,563 S-1/ A-5 combinations, installed primarily in B-24 Liberator bombers. Sperry S-1s helped fill the gap left by the Norden production predicament, but complicated maintenance, inferior accuracy, and supply concerns left it the bombsight of second choice. When America went to war, the Norden bombsight was a known quantity and tested in hundreds of thousands of bombings-the S-1 was not.25 Norden production began to catch up with demand by late 1943, but declining quality resulting from the mass-production techniques adopted for the Norden bombsight in wartime threatened to become a scandal.
