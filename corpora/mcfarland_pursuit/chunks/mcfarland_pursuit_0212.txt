Remington Rand, Lukas- Harold, and Victor the worst. Wright Field concluded that the Norden bombsights produced in 1944 were "not sufficiently accurate to hit the pickle barrel."27 Greater manufacturing tolerances and resulting inaccuracy, however, meant expanded production. The break-even point came in April 1944, when U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe notified Wright Field that it had a large inventory of bombsights and therefore wanted the next 1,000  146 Chapter 8 147 Procurement for War replacement heavy bombers sent to Europe without Norden bombsights, with only one bombsight for every two bombers after that. Ninth Air Force began sending its B-26s on missions with only six Norden bomb- sights for every eighteen aircraft to save weight.28 Another sign that the production crisis was over was the decision to allow the shipment of Norden bombsights to Allied countries. Thousands of American bombers went to Great Britain and other Allied nations under the Lend-Lease Act of 1941, but the Navy opposed any release "of this country's most prized possessions" to foreign nations for security reasons. The Navy claimed "the Norden bombsight is superior to the best bomb- sight available to the unfriendly nations in the ratio of 5 to 2 . .. and is considered to be the principal single factor of superiority which the air forces of this country possess over those of potential enemy countries." But when the Norden bombsight became "compromised because of loss in action," the Navy decided in January 1942 that Allied nations except for the Soviet Union could buy Norden bombsights. Two months later the secretary of the Navy altered the policy to exclude purchases until after production had met American needs, delaying foreign sales until 1944. By then shipments to the Soviet Union were also authorized. With the excep- tion of confidential transfers to the Soviet Union, no foreign governments placed orders for the Norden bombsight.29 Almost as production caught up with demand,
