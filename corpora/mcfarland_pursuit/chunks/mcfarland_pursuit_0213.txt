were also authorized. With the excep- tion of confidential transfers to the Soviet Union, no foreign governments placed orders for the Norden bombsight.29 Almost as production caught up with demand, overproduction became a problem. In June 1944 the Army Air Forces concluded that production facilities were in "excess of requirements," canceled 2,375 bombsights on order from the Navy, and reduced production at Victor from 500 to 250 per month. Which of five plants to reduce or eliminate first would be the next struggle. The Army Air Forces was in no mood to return to the BuOrd-Norden monopoly situation. The chief of the Materiel Division declared "this reduction will not be made at the expense of wholly con- trolled Army facilities."30 Although Remington Rand closed its assembly line on October 1, 1944,31 and Burroughs on December 31, 1944, produc- tion was still twice the number needed. AFCE/SBAE production exceeded demand in November 1943.32 With Norden bombsights plentiful, the Navy finally admitted it had little use for high-altitude horizontal bombing in a Navy wedded to dive bombing. In July 1944 the Pacific Fleet authorized its torpedo bomber squadrons to remove their Norden bombsights, maintaining in reserve only one per three aircraft.
