bsights. In March 1945 Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Ernest J. King ordered all horizontal bombing training terminated and the removal of Norden bombsights from all aircraft except multiengined pho- tographic aircraft (PB4Y) and VT (torpedo) Squadrons 17 and 83. All units were to return their Navy Mark XV Mod. 5 bombsights for reconditioning to Army M-9B standards and transfer to the Army.33 In January 1945, reacting to the shock of the Battle of the Bulge, the Army Air Forces reordered 4,000 M-9B Nordens from the Navy. Most came from Navy stocks, reworked to M-9B standards. The Navy offered the Army Air Forces directorship of the Norden facility at 80 Lafayette Street in another indication of its rejection of high-altitude horizontal bombing. The Army had its own production line at Victor and wanted nothing to do with Carl L. Norden, Inc.34 All production ended on V-J Day. From 1932 to the end of World War II, the Army procured 81,537 Nor- den bombsights, the Navy 8,353, at a cost of nearly $1.1 billion (see Table 8.4). In addition the Army produced, procured, and sold 40,723 Sperry S-1s, T-1/Mark XIVs, and Estoppey D-4Bs and D-8s (see Table 8.5). Di- rectly in support of these devices, American industry produced 90,000 SBAE/AFCEs, 35,000 glide bombing attachments, 55,000 bombsight disc speed tachometers, 3,500 rotor speed tachometers, 52,000 pilot direction indicators, 9,000 reflex sight kits, 16,000 low-altitude attachments, 10,500 tangent scale kits, 15,500 formation sticks, and 1,000 rate end computers. It was a prodigious, expensive, controversial, and dilatory achievement, re-  Procurement for War 149 148 Chapter 8 Table 8.5.
