Murtha Jr. said concerning Navy bombsight policies, "We're both working for the same Government; we're both fighting the same war." Perhaps.

Wright Field believed "in every incident of improved design in this equipment, including both the basic bombsight and related automatic flight control equipment, de- sign modifications essential to the Army Air Forces's use of the equipment have been obtained from sources other than the C. L. Norden Company," though Norden and the Navy still controlled production and distribution. For the Navy, the issue was not simple.
