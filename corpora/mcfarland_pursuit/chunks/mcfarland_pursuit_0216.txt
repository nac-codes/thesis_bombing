BuOrd claimed it was "a natural irritant to the  9 150 The Young Men behind Plexiglas The Young Men behind Plexiglas T he Norden Mark 15/M-series bombsight may have been a mar- vel of precision mechanical engineering, but without well- trained bombardiers it was but an expensive gadget. Before the war, hundreds of regular Army bombardiers trained at the lei- sure of peacetime, but the coming of war demanded the quick conversion of thousands of civilians to combat-ready bombardiers. Prewar training relied primarily on individual study. Bombardiers read all the available information on the bombsight they were using, studied the bomb ballistic tables, and then "went out and practiced bombing." Un- til July 1940, each bombing group was responsible for training its own bombardiers, who came primarily from the ranks of enlisted men. The Air Corps also held annual bombing and gunnery matches at Langley Field to encourage greater proficiency. Harold L. George, an originator of the doctrine of daylight precision strategic bombing, won the first of the an- nual matches in 1924. Bombardiers dropped bombs from 300, 5,000, and 8,000 feet. With improved bombsights and training, the average circular error dropped as low as 150 feet in 1931.1 Regulations required each bombardier to drop twelve bombs from 5,000 feet and twelve from 8,000 feet in proficiency training.

Regulation 440-40 of 1929 allowed crews to drop a sighting bomb to check for bombsight leveling, altitude settings, disk speed, wind, and other vari- ables before beginning official bombing for record, though a revised regu- lation prohibited such ai
