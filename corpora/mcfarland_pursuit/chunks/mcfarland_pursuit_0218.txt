raduates as instructors for bombardier schools  152 Chapter 9 The Young Men behind Plexiglas and to increase the 10-week instructor course to 12 weeks in March 1941 delayed progress, but set the basis for future expansion of the program. By the end of 1941 these schools had graduated only 206 bombardiers, far short of the 1,367 planned and the 8,100 needed. The first Lowry class trained for combat bombing was not ready until May 3, 1941.4 The expanding Air Corps, Army Air Forces after June 1941, needed Ellington and Barksdale fields for bombardment group training and for- mation. In December 1941 and February 1942 it therefore opened fields at Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Midland, Texas, for bombardier training. Arnold's 30,000-pilot program called for 5,590 bombardiers, but the 50,000-pilot program that followed in March 1942 called for 14,000 bom- bardiers. By July 1942 the 70,000-pilot program raised the requirement to 22,400 bombardiers and to 24,640 soon after that.5 On January 23, 1942, Arnold established the Flying Training Command (FTC) to regularize this chaos. FTC opened new bombardier schools at Victorville, California, in March 1942; Roswell, New Mexico, and Higley, Arizona, in June 1942; Big Spring, Texas, San Angelo, Texas, and Hobbs, New Mexico, in September 1942; Carlsbad, New Mexico, in October 1942; Deming, New Mexico, in December 1942; and Childress, Texas, in February 1943. The Carlsbad school joined Lowry in training bombardier instructors in January 1943, but the instructor program moved to Midland in August 1943.6 First in a trickle, but eventually in a flood, these schools mass-produced standardized bombardiers. In 1940 there were no bombardier school grad- uates. In 1941 there were 224, by June 1942 a cumulative 1,407, by De- cember 1942 4,748, and by the end of the war 52,495. The new Army Air Forces Training Command, formed on July 7, 1943, did not catch up with demand until January 1944, but by then possessed sufficient Norden bombsights
