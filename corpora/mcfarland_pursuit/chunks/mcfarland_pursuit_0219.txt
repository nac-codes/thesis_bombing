and by the end of the war 52,495. The new Army Air Forces Training Command, formed on July 7, 1943, did not catch up with demand until January 1944, but by then possessed sufficient Norden bombsights and aircraft to meet training quotas. Its teacher-to-student ra- tio of 1 : 3.7 would have been the envy of any air force, especially because many of its instructors were combat veterans. By January 1945 the Army Air Forces could trim the bombardier training system to four fields: Big Spring, Carlsbad, Childress, and San Angelo.7 At maximum output, the average Army Air Forces training field dropped 55,000 practice bombs per month and used 2,000 rolls of film to score them. In 12 weeks these bombardiers received 32 hours of bombard- ment theory, 16 hours of gyroscope training, 8 hours in a ground trainer, 32 hours of instruction in bombs, 128 hours in bombsight operation, 16 153 hours in the operation of the automatic flight control equipment (AFCE), and 8 weeks of flying training, involving 34 missions of at least three hours' duration.8 Training Manual 1-250 required each student to drop 188 bombs with a circular error of less than 230 feet from 12,000 feet to gradu- ate.9 Training dropped to 10 weeks because of war needs in January 1942 and to 9 weeks in February 1942, but by 1943 had risen to 12 weeks and 18 weeks in 1944. When it appeared in late 1944 that there would be a surplus of bombardiers for the remainder of the war, the Army Air Forces ordered a 24-week program, requiring 471 hours of ground school, 150 flying hours, and 300 practice bombings.10 When time permitted, bombardiers received five to six weeks of gun- nery training, because combat units expected them also to be responsible for firing defensive machine guns, coordinating defensive fire, administer- ing first aid, and managing the oxygen supply. Some also attended a ten- week "bombing through overcast" course to train for radar bombing.11 Entry requirements for bombardier school included a high sch
