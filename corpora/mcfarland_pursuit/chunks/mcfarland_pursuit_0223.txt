ing the SBAE/AFCE and bombsight, and the hours spent under arms guarding the instruments on the aircraft. Not until August 29, 1942, did General Arnold retreat from the absolute commit- ment to security he had made to the Navy, allowing canvas covers and canvas carrying cases to be used, under the justification that the metal boxes and cases were too heavy, built of strategic materials, too bulky, and required too many keys. Security overseas was less stringent. One crew- man remembered when his B-17 group landed in England, the local com- mander told the crews to leave their Norden bombsights lying on the edge of the runway.19 Regulations specified the means for destroying the bombsight to pre- vent its capture. "Two rounds with a .45 caliber service pistol into the rate end mechanism . . . and one round through the telescope," and (if possible) throwing it overboard were acceptable means of destruction, though man- uals explaining this technique failed to consider the possibility of ricochet- ing bullets. Navy personnel had the Mark 15 Mod. 1 demolition unit. The Army developed a bombsight destroyer device that might have served dou- ble duty as an aircraft destroyer device, consisting of an 18-inch cylinder  156 Chapter 9 The Young Men behind Plexiglas of steel, 51/2 inches in diameter, packed with 15 pounds of magnesium and an oxygen compound. Ignited by fuse, it acted as a blow torch focused on the bombsight. Perhaps effective, it was certainly hazardous.20 While thousands of citizen-soldiers worked their way through the Army Air Forces's bombardier training program, with all its security checks, the American public remained largely ignorant of the Norden bombsight until 1944. In 1942, when John Steinbeck wrote his propaganda piece Bombs Away: The Story of a Bomber Team, he made no reference to the Norden or any specific bombsight. Later the military allowed vague references to it. Henry B. Lent, in his book Bombardier: Tom Dixon Wins His Wings with the Bomber
