Team, he made no reference to the Norden or any specific bombsight. Later the military allowed vague references to it. Henry B. Lent, in his book Bombardier: Tom Dixon Wins His Wings with the Bomber Command (1944), typified the obscurant treatment the Norden bombsight received for most of the war. It was "Uncle Sam's Number One military secret," kept in a vault and only removed under armed guard. Such printed information was hardly grist for espionage.21 Some journalists wrote with apparent inside information or at least mis- information. Stanley Johnstone revealed in the Chicago Sunday Tribune in July 1941 that the Norden bombsight was a timing device connected to a Sperry automatic pilot similar to the German Lotfe 7B used over England. The secrets of the Norden's synchronous operation and of Carl Norden's SBAE/AFCE were safe. The wall of secrecy surrounding the Norden bombsight began to crack after the American entry into the war. These cracks presented no threat to national security, but they served to intensify the aura surrounding Carl Norden's invention. Newsweek told its readers in April 1942 that "the most discussed American military secret is un- doubtedly the Norden bombsight."22 The Navy, with authority over security policies, did not begin to ease up on the secrecy surrounding the Norden bombsight until October 1942, when the need for production efficiency overcame security obstructions. BuOrd that month lowered the security classification of the Mark 15/M- series bombsight from confidential to restricted, including the bombsight stabilizer, the glide bombing attachment, and the low-altitude bombing attachment.23 BuOrd still required bombardiers to destroy the equipment to prevent it from falling intact into enemy hands. Bombers had gone down in enemy territory, but officials presumed the crashes had destroyed the bombsights.
