mbardment Aviation, revealed that the Sperry and Norden bombsights were America's best and had to be de- stroyed when ditching.25 This secrecy extended especially to photographs. A generation of Americans could be forgiven for believing that American bombers went to war carrying canvas sacks in their plexiglas noses. Even in 1943, when the secret was out, photographs of bombardier positions still showed the bombsights covered. The public received its first look at America's most secret military device in 1944. In November Norden bombsights went on public display. Despite these revelations, the Navy did not remove its re- stricted classification on the Norden bombsight until May 5, 1947.26 Bombardiers had to learn to use the precision Norden M-series and Sperry S-1 and the nonprecision Estoppey D-8 and British T-1 bomb- sights, and several manual computing devices as part of their trade. Thou- sands of bombardier trainees found little excitement in learning to use the E-6B aerial computer (also known as the E-6B aerial "confuser") for de- termining ground speed, fuel consumption, altitude, and air speed; a Weems plotter for navigation; an AB computer for drift angle and drop angle; a C-2 or AN computer for altitude; a G-1 computer for air speed; a J-1 sighting angle computer to provide time of run; and free air tempera-  158 Chapter 9 The Young Men behind Plexiglas ture gauges, air speed indicators, altimeters, magnetic compasses, astro compasses, gyro-stabilized flux gate computers, drift meters, and radio compasses. There was nothing easy about the training process, nor about the instructor's responsibility for insuring the crew of a bomber did not waste seven hours of flying time, exposed to enemy fire, just to miss its target.27 FTC's aim was to produce five types of bombardiers. Of highest priority were the precision bombardiers slated for heavy bombers using Nordens and Sperrys. Next came the precision bombardiers-celestial navigators for manning B-29s. Due to
