bombardiers. Of highest priority were the precision bombardiers slated for heavy bombers using Nordens and Sperrys. Next came the precision bombardiers-celestial navigators for manning B-29s. Due to the navigator shortage early in the war, General Arnold in 1940 ordered the training of a third type, bombardier- navigators, but after Pearl Harbor canceled the program, with the excep- tion of the joint-training of crewmen for medium bombers. The fourth type were D-8 bombardier-gunners, trained for bombing and shooting from medium bombers. Finally, the training establishment turned out D-8 bombardiers-navigators, prepared for bombing and navigating on medium bombers.28 America's primary bombing trainer was the Beech AT-11, a version of the C-45 Expediter. Developed from the Beechcraft Model 18 commercial aircraft, the Army purchased over 5,000 of the twin-engine, all-metal monoplanes. Training for the Sperry S-1 bombsight usually occurred in the Lockheed-Vega B-34 Ventura, procured in numbers fewer than 200. A mid-wing medium bomber with twin rudders, the B-34 was a modification of the Lockheed Hudson built for the British in 1938. It was a less-than- satisfactory training platform because its engines required 100-octane fuel, expensive and scarce. From a beginning of only seventy-six aircraft in the first three months after Pearl Harbor, the Army Air Forces by October 1942 had 3,578 stu- dents sharing 577 aircraft, a ratio of 6.2 students per aircraft. By February 1943 the ratio had dropped to 4.3. Aircraft were available, but a shortage of bombsights forced trainees to use mockups and defective bombsights to fill the gap left by bombsight production problems. The Training Division of the Air Service Command estimated its needs at 1,320 Nordens in late 1941, revised upward to 3,453 in February 1942, for deployment by May 1943. By October 1943 the Army Air Forces Training Command held 1,953 Norden bombsights, only 57 percent of needs. Almost half these were obsolescen
