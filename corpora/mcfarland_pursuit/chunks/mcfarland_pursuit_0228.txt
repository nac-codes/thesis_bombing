rd to 3,453 in February 1942, for deployment by May 1943. By October 1943 the Army Air Forces Training Command held 1,953 Norden bombsights, only 57 percent of needs. Almost half these were obsolescent M-1 through M-6 models. The Training Command also used 917 Sperry S-1 bombsights to supplement its training quotas, but still fell 583 sights below anticipated needs.29 159 To fill the gap in aircraft and bombsights, the Army Air Forces used large numbers of ground bombing trainers. In the 1930s the Air Corps used models built at Wright Field, but had to equip them with D-4 bomb- sights because Air Corps Chief Benjamin Foulois refused to use his few Norden bombsights in ground trainers. The D-4 had no pilot direction indicator or provision for an automatic pilot, limiting its usefulness. For World War II the Army Air Forces used the A-2 trainer. A pilot steered a three-wheeled, 10-foot-high, electrically driven platform in response to the trainee's signals through a pilot direction indicator. The trainee aimed his Norden bombsight at an electrically driven box on the ground, decor- ated with a photograph of an actual target, moving at a uniform rate. A solenoid marked the point of impact. The A-2 could simulate drift and air speeds up to 284 MPH. The Link A-6 Bombing Trainer, which better simulated bombing mis- sions, improved training beginning in the fall of 1944. In the A-6 a projec- tor beamed the image of the terrain onto a mirror mounted on the ceiling of the forty-foot, silo-shaped trainer. The mirror reflected the image back to a photographic plate on the floor. Another beam of light indicated the bomb impact point based on the manipulation of the Norden bombsight. Unfortunately, it could only simulate missions to 18,000 feet, below most combat altitudes. By May 1945 the Army had 350 A-6 trainers in opera- tion. With a unit cost of $2,800, the A-6 saved FTC $150 per hour for training a bombardier in the air.30 After graduation, bombardiers joined bombardment g
