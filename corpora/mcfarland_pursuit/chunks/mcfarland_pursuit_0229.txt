945 the Army had 350 A-6 trainers in opera- tion. With a unit cost of $2,800, the A-6 saved FTC $150 per hour for training a bombardier in the air.30 After graduation, bombardiers joined bombardment groups at one of four numbered air forces (First, Third, or Fourth, but mainly the Second) located in the United States, for crew and unit training, including forma- tion bombing. Here the various components of a bombardment group merged to train as a team. From December 1942 to August 1945 nearly 30,000 heavy (B-17 and -24) and super-heavy (B-29) bombardment crews received such training. Bombing accuracy was generally worse than under Training Command because bombers now flew in formation. For the first six months of 1942, these units dropped 46,493 bombs. The best group, the 25th, needed four aircraft to achieve a 70 percent assurance of a hit, the worst group, the 309th, forty-three-hardly what AWPD/1 planners had anticipated. What did not vary was low altitudes for training missions. In the first six months of 1944, the four stateside numbered air forces dropped 678,190 practice bombs, but more than half were from below 10,000 feet. Bombardiers dropped only 12,000 bombs from above 20,000 feet due to shortages of aviation fuel. Accuracy as a result remained high,  160 Chapter 9 The Young Men behind Plexiglas with B-17 units achieving mean circular errors of 282 feet and B-24 units 304 feet when adjusted to an altitude of 12,000 feet.31 In addition to training bombardiers in the use of the Norden bombsight and associated equipment, the Army Air Forces had to provide for three echelons of bombsight and autopilot maintenance during the war. War- time precision bombsights and their associated automatic pilots depended on the smooth interaction and movement of gears, hydraulic cylinders, gyroscopes, and discs for accuracy. The smallest particles of dust or dirt, worn lubrication oil, or worn-out parts would have a detrimental effect on bombing accuracy. The prevailing shor
