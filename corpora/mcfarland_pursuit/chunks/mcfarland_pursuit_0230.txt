cylinders, gyroscopes, and discs for accuracy. The smallest particles of dust or dirt, worn lubrication oil, or worn-out parts would have a detrimental effect on bombing accuracy. The prevailing shortage of bombsights through 1944 also meant bombing equipment had to be used repeatedly, relying on maintenance and repair rather than replacement to maintain accuracy. First-echelon maintenance at the squadron level, done generally by bombardiers, involved preflight checks, cleaning, oiling, and simple parts replacement. More sophisticated maintenance, including calibration and replacement of most parts, came at the group level or second echelon. Each major numbered air force also had a third, depot-level maintenance program carried out by a service command. Responsible for diagnosing problems, maintaining spare parts, and everything short of manufacturing a new sight or autopilot, this echelon was generally the highest level of Army Air Forces bombsight maintenance. A fourth level of maintenance involved the factories producing the bombsights and autopilots, responsi- ble for upgrades, remanufacturing, and spare parts.32 From 1928 to 1938, 140 airmen graduated from bombsight mainte- nance training in the Air Corps. Minimum qualifications for officer and enlisted candidates were mechanical proficiency, color vision, and until June 1943, a special security clearance. The security clearance was gener- ally stricter than for bombardiers because of the special knowledge me- chanics would have of the bombsight's operation and composition. Before 1941 a trainee had to have at least three years in service, to establish his reliability, before acceptance into bombsight maintenance training. Ini- tially tactical units provided first- and second-echelon maintenance train- ing, while the Norden factory held responsibility for all third- and fourth- level maintenance. In May 1936, to bring order to this process in hopes that improved maintenance would bring better accuracy, Chief o
