orced a complete revision of the maintenance training program. The Air Staff called for 3,480 mechanics to be trained in 1942, but later raised the quota to 4,160. Lowry went to a six-day work week, two shifts per day, to provide training for what was now a 12-week course for 110 students at a time. Yale University assumed responsibility for training additional mechanics for the first and second echelons of maintenance, while Minneapolis-Honeywell began a 28-day training program for its new C-1 automatic flight control equipment at the University of Minnesota.34 In September 1943, because of continuing complaints about Lowry-trained mechanics, the Army Air Forces adopted an extended training program, following the course at Lowry with an eight-week internship at a bombardier school. The Navy refused to ex- pand the training program at Norden until March 1942 and then within the year stopped all such training, claiming it interfered with plant produc- tion. The decision to discontinue Sperry S-1 bombsights and A-5 auto- pilots relieved pressure on the program in late 1943 and the quality of instruction increased. Bombardier training and bombsight and autopilot maintenance training formed key components in the struggle for precision bombing during the war. Carl Norden had designed a device so complex that proper operation and maintenance had a significant impact on bombing accuracy. Ulti- mately the Army Air Forces training program met its goals. Bombardier and bombsight technician shortages were only temporary and combat groups did not have to reduce operations because of them. But quantity did not necessarily mean quality. The training schools ranked their graduates at one of three levels. The highest rank was Distinguished Bombardier, signifying a graduate who had attained an average circular error in training of less than 106 feet. Next was the Master Bombardier, with an average circular error of less than 136 feet. The lowest rank was Bombardier, with a circular
