sions, German defenses, and other problems interfered with the strategic bombing effort, but throughout, bombing accuracy remained the key con- sideration and determinant of success. With suitable conditions, the proper adjustments, and a well-trained bombardier, a generation of Ameri- 167 cans believed the Norden bombsight would hit its target. Analyses of bombing errors focused on other causes, rarely questioning the basic de- sign of Carl Norden's mechanical marvel-known affectionately in Eu- rope as the "football" because of its size and shape.4 Wartime experience forced a wholesale reevaluation of bomb-aiming techniques developed before the war. Antiaircraft artillery fire forced bombers to fly higher. Ground fire plus German fighter attacks forced shortened bomb runs, interfering with the Norden aiming procedure. By far the greatest obstacle to precision bombing proved to be obstacles to the Norden's visual aiming: clouds, smoke, dust, and debris. The most immediate problem was building a force for the job. AWPD/1 had assumed an air force of 6,834 medium and heavy bombers requiring six months to defeat Germany. While Maj. Gen. Carl Spaatz organized Eighth Air Force in the United States, Brig. Gen. Ira Eaker went to Eng- land in February 1942 to pave the way for units to follow. Preparing bases in England and problems putting the American economy onto a war foot- ing, not the least of which was Norden bombsight production, delayed the first B-17 bombing raid until August 17, 1942. Eaker's twelve Flying Fortresses attacking the Rouen/Sotteville marshalling yard in France rep- resented less than two-thousandths of the force called for in AWPD/1. It was only a beginning-day one of 973 days of American strategic bombing to destroy the German ability to wage war. After the first five missions, one of which dropped no bombs, Eaker reported 10 percent of bombs dropped landed on the targets Ã¥nd 25 per- cent fell within 750 feet of the aiming points.
