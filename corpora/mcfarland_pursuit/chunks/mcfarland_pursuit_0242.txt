the first five missions, one of which dropped no bombs, Eaker reported 10 percent of bombs dropped landed on the targets Ã¥nd 25 per- cent fell within 750 feet of the aiming points. Although the targets were large marshalling yards and an airfield, the Americans proved more accu- rate than the British, who were getting 10 percent within one mile of the aiming point at night. With ten groups, Eaker told Spaatz, he could de- stroy Germany's aircraft and submarine industries.5 While the buildup continued, Eaker and Spaatz struck mainly at subma- rine installations and shipyards. Not until January 27, 1943, did Eighth Air Force attack a target inside Germany. Not until May 1943 was it able to launch missions of 250 bombers. But what to attack? Wartime experience revealed AWPD/1's target list to be obsolete. According to Elihu Root Jr., special advisor to Army Air Forces's chief Henry Arnold, "The enemy economy was too large-thousands of times too large-to blast it all. We had to choose vital points where small physical damage would cause great industrial disruption." The German machine-tool industry, for example, consisted of over 6,000 small firms. The colonels and captains of AWPD/1  168 Chapter 10 Precision Strategic Bombing against Germany had identified the Luftwaffe, electrical power, transportation centers, oil, and morale as targets. Lt. Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, as commanding gen- eral of American forces in Europe, assigned Eighth Air Force the tactical task of "obtaining and maintaining domination of the air over Western France." Eighth Air Force commander Spaatz assigned aircraft factories, marshalling yards, and submarine installations as targets for fulfilling Ei- senhower's directive. In 1943 Eighth Air Force was ready to begin a limited offensive, but no one could agree on the choke-points that would strangle the German economy. One thing was for sure-the United States would not target civilians. Ira Eaker said later that "we should never allow the history
