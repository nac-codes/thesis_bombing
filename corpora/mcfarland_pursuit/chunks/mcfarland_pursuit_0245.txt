wed four bombs with delayed fuzes of 0.25 seconds could produce about 6,400 square feet of damage. With 0.01-second delays, the bombs produced about 16,000 square feet of damage. The short-delay 500-pound M-43 and M-64 bombs therefore became the standard weapons for the daylight precision strategic bombing campaign against Germany for the remainder of the war, combined with the M-47 incendiary bomb preferred by Longfellow's successor, Maj. Gen. Fred Anderson.11 The 500-pound M-43 with 267 pounds of TNT created a crater two feet deep and nine feet in diameter in sandy loam with an instantaneous fuze.12 If the calculations of the Bombs and Fuzes Subsection were correct, and they were too optimistic, the eight M-43s carried by a B-17 would damage 32,000 square feet. Eighth Air Force's average circular error of 900 feet was an area 79 times greater. Richard Hughes, then head of Eighth Air Force's Operational Planning Section, concluded: The pre-war myth of a bomb in an apple barrel from 20,000 feet was quickly exploded, and, to the intense disappointment of the regulars, it became apparent quickly that to destroy, or even to hit, a given target  170 Chapter 10 171 Precision Strategic Bombing against Germany was going to call for a vastly greater weight of attack than had been dreamed of in a pre-war doctrine. Contrary to all expectations, with a few notable exceptions, the strategic bombers of the 8th and 15th Air Forces seldom succeeded in achieving real precision bombing.13 The Norden rifle would have to become more of a shotgun. Carl Norden's bombsight did not receive a fair trial in the first several months of operations. Commanders decided that a B-17 force could not fly straight and level for more than ten seconds without getting shot down. Ten seconds or more gave antiaircraft gunners time to determine the ele- vation, slant range, and azimuth of a bomber. Norden had not designed his bombsight for such a short bombing run.
