leader technique elimi- nated bombsight shortages in Eighth Air Force. In March 1944 it asked that the next 1,000 bombers sent to England come without bombsights because it held 366 excess Nordens and 1,351 excess Sperrys.19 The drop-on-the-leader technique also raised the question about whether the formation should drop its bombs by intervalometer or by salvo (instantaneous release) technique. Intervalometer bombing appeared more efficient, flooding the target area with bombs at regular intervals and guaranteeing a higher probability of a hit. Studies by the Eighth Air Force Operational Analysis Section, however, showed "the probability of missing altogether small or medium size targets is not greater with salvo release than with intervalometer release; indeed, on small targets it is substantially less." Roughly twice as many bombs fell within 500 feet of the target with instantaneous salvoing. Too many malfunctions and the difficulty of hold- ing formation for the seconds required for a bombing run by intervalome- ter encouraged Eighth Air Force to de-emphasize the intervalometer in 1943 and to give up on it in 1944, except especially large targets. The Army Air Forces was moving away from "pickle-barrel" precision bombing to highly concentrated, but not precision, overwhelming force. Several hun- dred bombs would now cancel the errors of high-altitude bombing.20 These changes forced a revision in the procedure for scoring accuracy. For nearly three decades American airmen had determined accuracy by measuring the distance from the point of impact to the aiming point. Now they were aiming hundreds and thousands of bombs at one target, making circular error measurement difficult and misleading. Dropping-on-the- leader, formation bombing, and saturation or carpet bombing forced the move away from circular error to "mean point of impact." Photo interpret- ers drew a circle of 1,000-feet radius around the greatest concentration of bombs. The distance from the assigned
