forced the move away from circular error to "mean point of impact." Photo interpret- ers drew a circle of 1,000-feet radius around the greatest concentration of bombs. The distance from the assigned aiming point to the center of the 1,000-foot circle became the new circular error, measured as the percent- age of bombs falling within the 1,000-foot circle.

Training and experi- ence raised accuracy through the remainder of the year (see Figure 10.1). The average circular error nevertheless remained an abysmal 1,200 feet. Put another way, out of every 100 bombers flying into harm's way, sixteen dropped bombs within 1,000 feet of the aiming point. Eighty-four missed. With bomber losses averaging 7 percent in May and 10 percent during the Blitz Week of July 24-30, the United States was paying a high price for daylight precision strategic bombing. Every B-17 or B-24 downed meant the Army Air Forces lost ten men and a $187,742 or $215,516 airplane ($1.2 million and $1.388 million in 1992 dollars). Despite the public rela- tions blitz that accompanied daylight precision strategic bombing, these figures were the reality of high-altitude bombing under wartime condi- tions.22 A major cause of bombing error was the increased altitude bombers sought to escape German flak. The B-17 proved more survivable in the skies over Germany largely because it could fly higher than the B-24. Ev-  Chapter 10 174 45 Precision Strategic Bombing against Germany 40 35 30 25 % wit
