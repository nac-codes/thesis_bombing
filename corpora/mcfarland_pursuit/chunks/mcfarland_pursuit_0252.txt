bombardiers aimed for different spots on larger targets to achieve a better distribution of bombs. Again bombing analysis showed better results when all bombardiers aimed at one point.23 By mid-1943 these lessons and techniques were ready for the strategic bombing campaign. An initial choke-point target was the I. G. Farbenin- dustrie synthetic rubber plant at HÃ¼ls on June 22. The 541-acre site was Germany's largest producer of synthetic rubber (30 percent of wartime production) and also produced diethyl benzene for aviation gas. The Nor- den "rifle" sight failed to work that day, but 1,780 bombs aimed by the Norden "shotgun" sight shut the facility down for one month and re- stricted production for six, creating a serious rubber shortage. Craters cov- ered over 12 square miles, with 20 percent landing inside the plant area. A participant summed up daylight precision strategic bombing that day: "We had dropped 422 tons of bombs and, according to the reconnaissance pho- tos, only 333.4 tons had been wasted on homes, streets, public parks, zoos, department stores and air-raid shelters. This passed for precision."24 Famous among these early bombing efforts was the second attack against the Schweinfurt ball-bearing factories on October 14, 1943. Six- teen bomb groups flew over 500 miles into Germany, without escorting fighters, in pursuit of the elusive choke-point in the German economy. The cost was high-60 out of 229 B-17s bombing that day and 138 more damaged, and 599 crewmen dead or missing in action. First and Third Bomb Division aircraft dropped 459 1,000-pound and 663 500-pound high-explosive bombs and 1,751 100-pound incendiary bombs (482.8 tons).25 Three groups missed the targets and five more dropped fewer than 10 percent of their bombs within 500 feet. Most accurate was the 351st, with 29 percent hits. Overall, one bomb out of ten hit within 500 feet of the targets and there were sixty-three direct hits. Three bearings plants lost 10 percent of their machine
