rate was the 351st, with 29 percent hits. Overall, one bomb out of ten hit within 500 feet of the targets and there were sixty-three direct hits. Three bearings plants lost 10 percent of their machines damaged or destroyed.26 In early 1944 the Army Air Forces won air superiority over Europe and bombing accuracy increased. Eighth Air Force commander Jimmy Doolit- tle believed "there was no real improvement in the bombing equipment. The improvement was in the environment in which the bombing took place."27 Bombing accuracy also improved as the Army Air Forces began to focus its efforts against specific industries, most well defined and gener- ally clear of urban congestion: the aircraft industry in early 1944, oil in mid-1944, and oil and the transportation network in late 1944 and 1945, with occasional forays against jet aircraft production and urban areas.

Aver- age bombing altitudes for those two months were 16,500 feet compared to a wartime average of 24,500 feet. The effect of lower altitudes on bombing accuracy, especially in conditions of near-total air superiority, was dramatic (see Figure 10.3).28 Accuracy was especially critical when Army commanders called on the strategic bombers to provide close air support for troops on the ground. Twenty-five missions in Italy, mainly around the Anzio beachhead, resulted in seven total mis
