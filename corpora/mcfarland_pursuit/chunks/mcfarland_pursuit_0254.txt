hen Army commanders called on the strategic bombers to provide close air support for troops on the ground. Twenty-five missions in Italy, mainly around the Anzio beachhead, resulted in seven total misses, one achieving over 50 percent hits within 1,000 feet of the aiming point, and the remainder between 20 and 50 percent of bombs within 1,000 feet of the aiming point. In all, the effort caused "rela- tively few casualties" among enemy units. At Monte Cassino on February 15, 1944, bombers dropped 576 tons of explosives with poor accuracy from 15,000 feet, largely due to smoke and dust obscuring bombardiers' aim.29 The most famous use of strategic bombers from high altitude in the close air support role was the COBRA carpet bombing at Saint-LÃ´ on July 24 and 25, 1944. Over 2,000 bombers attacked a target one mile deep by five miles long, some dropping early by accident and others because dust, smoke, and debris near the target area obscured the aiming points. In a tragic example of how the drop-on-the-leader technique could magnify one bombardier's mistake, an early release by one leader caused his forma- tion to bomb the American 30th Infantry Division, killing more than 100 soldiers. Nearly 50 percent of the bombs fell on target, 30 to 35 percent fell beyond the target area, and 5 to 10 percent fell short. The attack helped Lt. Gen. Omar Bradley's forces to break out of the Bocage country of Normandy, but the massive effort killed only 3 percent of the German soldiers facing Bradley's command.30 In 1944 and 1945 Eighth Air Force identified the synthetic oil industry as the most vulnerable choke-point in the German industrial fabric. With production concentrated at fifty-four sites, planners saw oil as the Achilles' heel of the motorized German military machine. The targets were rela- tively easy to locate and highly concentrated-the perfect target of day- light precision strategic bombing and the Norden precision bombsight.
