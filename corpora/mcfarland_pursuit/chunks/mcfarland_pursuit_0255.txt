ets were rela- tively easy to locate and highly concentrated-the perfect target of day- light precision strategic bombing and the Norden precision bombsight. The Ammoniakwerke Merseburg GmbH at Leuna, Germany, was par- ticularly important for producing fuel, ammonia, and nitrogen for explo- sives from coal. Minister of Armaments and Munitions Albert Speer or- dered it defended by 506 antiaircraft guns. Covering a rectangle 11,600 feet long by 3,500 feet wide, it received eighteen American day and four British night attacks. Bombing statistics did not speak well for daylight precision strategic bombing. Of 85,074 bombs dropped, only 10 percent landed inside the plant's perimeter fence covering 757 acres. Of these, 16 percent failed to explode. Few hit critical components and the damage was quickly repaired. Forty-five B-17s dropped 1,383 bombs on Leuna under good visual conditions on the most accurate mission. Excluding unexploded bombs, 33 percent hit the target. On the worst day 574 bombers dropped 8,000 bombs by blind-bombing techniques because of a total cloud cover. Only six bombs hit the target, at a cost of 27 bombers and their crews. A nearby decoy plant attracted more than half the bombs aimed at Leuna. Leuna was not the exception. The U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey closely examined the results of dropping 146,000 high-explosive bombs on Leuna and two other oil targets (Ludwigshafen-Opau and Zeitz) during fifty-seven raids. Only one bomb in twenty-nine hit the targets and did any damage. For the entire oil offensive, the Army Air Forces dropped 123,586 tons of bombs to get 19,029 tons inside the fences of the synthetic fuel plants, only 4,326 tons of which hit anything significant. The Bombing Survey concluded that it was "easier to hit an elephant with a shotgun" than a rifle.31  178 Chapter 10 179 Precision Strategic Bombing against Germany Period Table 10.1.
