Production at Leuna resumed on May 22, 1944, after the attack of May 12, June 3 after the May 28 attack, July 9 after the July 7 attack, and so on. After nine strikes, it still produced at 28 percent its normal level.32 One reason for the lack of accuracy during the oil campaign was clouds and smoke obscuring the targets. Throughout the strategic air campaign against Germany, according to the Eighth Air Force Operational Analysis Section, "the most pressing problem of daylight formation bombing from the point of view of bombing accuracy is the development of more effec- tive techniques for bombing under conditions of poor visibility." Cloud cover, generally measured in tenths, blocked the view of the bombardier. The great weakness of the Norden bombsight was that it required visual contact between the bombardier's eye and the target. Solid cloud cover was an obvious barrier, but any stray cloud blocking the bombardier's vision between the bomb release point and the target was equally obstructive. "Now you see it, now you don't" allowed bombardiers too little time to operate the Norden bombsight. So critical was the problem that Arnold authorized Eighth Air Force to area-bomb the built-up areas of German cities when the weather made precision bombing impossible.33 In the 456 days from January 1944 t
