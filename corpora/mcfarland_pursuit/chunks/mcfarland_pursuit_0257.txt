tical was the problem that Arnold authorized Eighth Air Force to area-bomb the built-up areas of German cities when the weather made precision bombing impossible.33 In the 456 days from January 1944 to March 1945, visual bombing with the Norden bombsight was possible only 132 days (see Table 10.1). Based on data from 723 missions, the Strategic Bombing Survey concluded that circular error nearly doubled when clouds blocked the aiming point. Day- light precision strategic bombing would fail unless bombardiers could find a means for seeing through clouds (see Figure 10.4). Until late 1943, clouds generally meant aborted missions or a timed 1100 469 66 1000 0/10s 1/10s 2/10s 3/10s 4/10s 5/10s 6/10s 7/10s 8/10s 9/10s 10/10s CLOUD COVER - Number of missions Figure 10.4.

In a maneuver developed by Asa Dun- can in 1927 at the Pee Dee River Bridge and Robert Olds in the 1930s at Langley Field, the bombardier would lock a visible initial point into the Norden bombsight and use a map to measure the time necessary to fly to the target. The navigator was responsible for flying the correct heading. The 464th Bomb Group used a timed run of 50 miles against Oberweis- senfeld in September 1944, socked in with 10/10 clouds, and dropped its bombs 3,000 feet left of target. A month later the 97th Bomb Group at- tacked Pilsen Skoda after a 40-mile timed run and missed by 10 miles.34 The Army Air Forces needed a better solution. The search for solutions to the problem of clouds, dust, or smoke ob- scuring the line-of-sight view of the Norden bombsight began on Novem- ber 4, 1939, when Major General Arnold directed the Materiel Division to investigate bombing through overcast. Researchers examined optical filters for conventional bombsights and the use of a pilot aircraft flying below t
