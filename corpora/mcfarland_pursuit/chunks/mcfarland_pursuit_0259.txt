transmitter and a receiver, bouncing signals off two ground stations to determine range, which appeared on a scope in the aircraft. Accuracy was similar to Oboe, but with greater range due to a longer radio beam. The operator fed rate information to the bombardier, who used vis- ual sightings when possible to improve accuracy. When this was first used on January 28, 1944, Eighth Air Force achieved an average circular error of 1,864 feet on Gee-H missions.35 Micro-H triggered Gee-H ground beacons, whose signals appeared on a radar screen in the aircraft, adding Gee-H range information to the ground returns of the radar equipment. The radar operator called out predeter- mined check points, allowing the bombardier to synchronize his bomb- sight. Micro-H improved ground-beacon accuracy to around 1,500 feet and entered combat for Eighth Air Force on August 5, 1944.36 A second means of blind bombing, self-contained radar systems, were products of General Arnold's decision in 1940 to name "bombing through overcast" as the Air Corps' "problem No. 1" for the consideration of the newly established National Defense Research Committee.37 By the Ameri- can entry into the war, Western Electric and Sperry Gyroscope had con- nected an ASV-10 submarine searching radar to a Sperry S-1 bombsight. Out of this research came the AN/APQ-13, a modification of the British H,S radar; the AN/APS-15, the American H2X, popularly known as "Mickey"; the AN/APQ-7, with greater range and higher resolution; and the AN/APQ-10, which allowed evasive maneuvers at a constant altitude.38 These devices measured reflections of radio transmissions off terrain features. H2S and H2X were primarily for high-altitude aerial navigation, most useful when land/water contrasts were present. H2S used the S band (10 cm) and had poor resolution, making identification of ground features difficult. H2X used the X band (3 cm) and had better resolution from its higher frequency and a range advantage over the H2S radar of
