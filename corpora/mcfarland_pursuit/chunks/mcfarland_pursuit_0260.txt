and had poor resolution, making identification of ground features difficult. H2X used the X band (3 cm) and had better resolution from its higher frequency and a range advantage over the H2S radar of 30 to 50 miles, reaching out as far as 90 miles. Army Air Forces units first used the H2S operationally in September 1943, the H2X in November 1943. H2S and H2X were not radar bombsights, only assisting the bombing operation by replacing the optical telescope. With the Norden bombsight alone, the bombardier killed drift by turning the drift and turn knobs to fly the aircraft so that the target appeared to move down the vertical reticle in the scope. He then killed rate by turning the rate knob to synchronize the bombsight so that the ground appeared motionless in the scope. Fi- nally, he placed the target at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical reticles using the displacement knob. In H2X synchronous bombing, the H2X operator killed drift by direct- ing the pilot to fly the aircraft over the target. He then notified the bom- bardier of several angle measurements between the vertical and a line from the aircraft to the target, allowing the bombardier to determine the ground speed of the aircraft, killing rate by turning the rate knob and fixing the unseen target on the horizontal reticle. The radar set measured altitude and ground range. If a break occurred in the undercast, the bombardier could optically adjust any of the three steps to improve accuracy. An in- the-field modification synchronized the H2X set with the Norden bomb- sight,39 using the radar to fix the cross wires on the target directly. If visual corrections were not possible, the bombardier dropped his bombs when the target touched bomb-release circles on the radar scope that matched dropping angles for various speeds and altitudes.40 Radar-assisted bombing was inherently inaccurate. Operator error con- tributed from 1,000 to 3,000 feet of inaccuracy, beam width up to 1,500 feet, data transmis
