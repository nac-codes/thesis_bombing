al-radar coordination, it was most effective with the higher resolution Bell Telephone Laboratories X-band Eagle (AN/APQ-7) radar. Known as NOSMEAGLE, this first true radar bomb- sight proved twice as accurate as H2X. The Eagle radar determined ground speed, wind speed and direction, and altitude. The bombardier set the disc speed on the Norden bombsight according to this information, while the radar operator killed drift and synchronized the sight with the target. In test bombings near Orlando, Florida, NOSMEAGLE achieved a circular error of 800 feet from an altitude of 20,000 feet with the Norden bomb- sight. War in Europe ended before it could be tested in combat.43 Despite the limitations of radar and beacon bombing, these technolo- gies allowed the Army Air Forces to bomb when weather otherwise would have prevented it. Crews especially appreciated "electronic" attacks; pro- tected by clouds, the chances of getting home safely from a blind-bombing mission were nearly six times greater than from a visual-bombing mission. If the Allies had been forced to await weather conditions conducive to vis- ual bombing, the number of bombs dropped on Germany would have de- clined by 52 percent in 1944 and 1945. These additional 195,000 tons of bombs, nearly 20 percent of all bombs dropped by the Army Air Forces on Table 10.2.
