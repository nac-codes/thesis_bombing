Germany during the war, were an integral part of the bombing campaign to destroy the German war economy (see Table 10.2). Beacon aids and radar allowed American bombardiers to aim their bombs at specific targets in the German industrial web through clouds and smoke, though bombing inaccuracy made such missions area attacks in ef- fect (see Table 10.3). These techniques meant that Eighth Air Force dropped 3.7 bombs on clear days to achieve one hit within 1,000 feet of the target, 13.4 on days of poor visibility, 23.2 with Gee-H, 24.1 with Micro- H, and 567.4 with H2X in total cloud cover. Missions relying on blind- bombing aids remained officially "last resort attacks."44 The doctrine of daylight precision strategic bombing still depended on the Norden optical bombsight operating in clear weather. Bombing through overcast made targets out of urban areas, despite official and unof- ficial policies against terror bombing. For bombardiers, the difference be-  Chapter 10 184 tween precision and urban area bombing was not always significant. Di- rected to bomb the Fredrichstrasse Station in Berlin, Charles "One Shot" Hudson of the 91st Bomb Group said, "No one expected me to hit it. Anyplace in the center of the city would do just as well. This is total war, and I feel not the least reluctant about bombing this city." Phillip Ardery believed he was there to bomb Berlin, "and one place was about as good as another." Another aimed for a hole in the clouds, hitting "whatever part of the city happened to be underneath."45 Air Corps Tactical School doctrine had foreseen the bombing of enemy urban areas to destroy morale, but had restricted such strikes to the latter stages of a war aft
