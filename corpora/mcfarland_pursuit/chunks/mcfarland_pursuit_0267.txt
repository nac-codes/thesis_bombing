e pickle barrel, the question imme- diately arises as to what will happen and what effect this will have on morale. ... Air Service Command feel that this is of sufficient impor- tance and is so susceptible to criticism by the public with a morale factor also involved that they desire a headquarters decision on their future action in this matter. The only feasible solution was to overhaul all Norden bombsights then in service, which would take "at least, one to two years." By August 1944 the Army Air Forces had acquired over 40,000 bombers and trainers using these inferior Norden bombsights. It was too late to make changes.52 Despite two decades of research and development, the United States discovered in the skies over Europe that the precision bombing often com- pared to a surgeon's keen scalpel53 was in fact a bludgeon.54 The 85,074 bombs dropped on the Leuna synthetic oil facility were a far cry from the nine bombs prewar planners assumed would destroy the Sault Ste. Marie locks between Michigan and Ontario.55 There was nothing surgical or pre- cise about dropping 158 4,500-pound bombs, 48,575 2,000-pound bombs. 564,969 1,000-pound bombs, 3,089,916 500-pound bombs, 1,055,289 250-pound bombs, 1,520,209 100-pound bombs, and 1,151,885 incendiary bombs in the war against Germany.56 What effect did 7,431,001 bombs dropped at a cost of $30 billion have on the German industrial web? Eighth Air Force high-altitude daylight precision strategic bombing, aimed by the Norden bombsight, averaged 31.8 percent of its bombs within 1,000 feet of the aiming point from an average altitude of 21,000 feet. Fifteenth Air Force averaged 30.78 percent from 500 feet lower altitude. A 20-foot crater from a 500-pound bomb was only overturned earth if no critical industrial tool or structure had for- merly occupied its space. Even if American bombardiers had been able to hit their targets regularly, their bombs were too small to damage most of the industries at which they were aimed. The A
