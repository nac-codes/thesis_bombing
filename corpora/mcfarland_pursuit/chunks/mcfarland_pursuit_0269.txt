hat it made their ordi- nary bombardiers as good as our experts."59 Privately many airmen also questioned precision bombing, but did their jobs regardless. Burrell Ellison of the 392nd Bomb Group claimed: We did more damage to German agriculture than we did to manufac- turing. We did tear up a lot of fields and forests. I question now, as I questioned in 1943-44, if the bombing was worth the expense in time, money and life. But question or no question, we flew day in and day out and nobody expected to live through it. I know that the completion of tour of duty was a surprise to me. It was akin to being born again.60 Despite these doubts, American precision bombing was sufficiently ac- curate to cause shortages in products critical to the German war effort. Much of the effectiveness of an attack, whatever the accuracy, was depen- dent on the priority Germany assigned to repairing it. From July 1943 to February 1944 Eighth Air Force attacked the German aircraft assembly industry as a top priority, yet the Luftwaffe never suffered from aircraft shortages because of rapid repairs. A November 30, 1944, attack on the Friedrich-Alfred Hutte iron and steel plant, with a low priority for repair, dropped only three 500-pound bombs within 1,000 feet of the aiming  188 Chapter 10 189 Precision Strategic Bombing against Germany point and eliminated all production for 83 days. The Maschinenfabrik at Augsburg on October 19, 1944, received 150 500-pound bombs within 1,000 feet of the aiming point and suffered a 27-day loss of production because of a high repair priority.61 The Air Corps Tactical School faculty and the AWPD/1 team had not anticipated the need for repeat missions to keep a bombed target de- stroyed. Albert Speer told his captors in 1945 that the reason strategic bombing failed to knock Germany out of the war was the failure to follow up initial bombings. Still, these bombings caused Germany to divert enor- mous resources from other vital areas to repair the damage of
