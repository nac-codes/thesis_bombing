failed to knock Germany out of the war was the failure to follow up initial bombings. Still, these bombings caused Germany to divert enor- mous resources from other vital areas to repair the damage of strategic bombing and to defend against it. Speer estimated Germany lost 10,000 heavy guns, 6,000 tanks, and 20,000 antiaircraft guns in 1943 because of the bombing campaign. It was, he said, Germany's "greatest lost battle."62 The bombing of the Regensburg-East marshalling yard on December 20, 1944, demonstrated the most serious weakness of daylight precision strategic bombing. Accuracy was excellent, but repair crews returned the yard to service in four days. Holding up 1,200 railroad cars every day was a creditable contribution to the Allied war effort, but repeating the attack every four days to insure the loss of this one marshalling yard, among hun- dreds, was beyond American capabilities.63 To suggest, as one observer did, that "there appears to be precious little in the conduct of the daylight bomber offensive against Germany through June 1944 that vindicate the theory of precision, industrial bombardment," is to set up a straw man that bombing had to destroy the German economy to be successful.64 Accuracy lagged behind doctrine, but daylight precision strategic bombing forced the Luftwaffe into a battle of attrition that al- lowed Eighth Air Force to win air superiority over Europe for OVERLORD and the ground offensive that followed.65 Germany could make substitu- tions and keep critical industries in operation through expensive repair ef- forts, but daylight precision strategic bombing forced a major diversion of German war-fighting capabilities away from its forces in the field to defend and repair industrial and transportation sites in Germany. Germany was able to increase its military production during the war, but daylight preci- sion strategic bombing limited that expansion and made sure it would oc- cur in areas that would not contribute to German milit
