to increase its military production during the war, but daylight preci- sion strategic bombing limited that expansion and made sure it would oc- cur in areas that would not contribute to German military successes. Bombing stopped German oil production and destroyed 20 percent of German war production in the last 16 months of the war. These were wor- thy accomplishments.66 Bombing accuracy during the attack on the Augsburg Maschinenfabrik in October 1944 was only average, but was enough to cost Germany 644 tanks that might have turned the tide at the Battle of the Bulge. Any army corps would be proud to claim the destruction of 644 enemy tanks in one battle. Accuracy for the Fifteenth Air Force's May 31, 1944, attack on the Romano Americana Refinery at Ploesti was poor, but sufficient to cost Germany 38,550 metric tons of oil products that would have kept the Ger- man army mobile at many critical points in 1944. Strategic bombing was a vital, though not independent, component in the Allied war strategy.67 Ironically, the failure to achieve prewar hopes of precision during World War II spawned an unintended consequence. More precise bomb- ing would still have destroyed the resources Germany required to wage war, but by its very preciseness would have failed to convince the German people that they were beaten. By not laying waste to thousands of acres of urban landscape, by not killing hundreds of thousands of civilians, and by not causing great amounts of collateral damage, true precision bombing would have eliminated much of the horror of war. The area or imprecise bombing of German cities failed to destroy the morale and will of the Ger- man people, but along with the ground invasion succeeded in convincing them that Germany had been both defeated and beaten. According to the Strategic Bombing Survey, the effort depressed morale, convinced 78 per- cent of the German people that the war had been a mistake, and "brought home to the German people the full impact of mo
