to the Strategic Bombing Survey, the effort depressed morale, convinced 78 per- cent of the German people that the war had been a mistake, and "brought home to the German people the full impact of modern war." These attacks left the German people with a solid lesson in the disadvantages of war. There would be no "stab in the back" myths as after World War I.68 That strategic bombing failed to win the war independently is clear.69 Doctrine called for bombing to "paralyze the nation's ability to wage war" and eliminate Germany's "capability of conducting military operations." Daylight precision strategic bombing did not deprive the German military of the weapons it needed to wage war, though bombing certainly deprived Germany of the weapons needed to wage war effectively. That daylight precision strategic bombing could not have won the war independently if given several more months is not clear.70 Accuracy was not good. Thousands of bombs fell so that a few could hit the target. Whatever precision bombing did to knock out vital industries was done by remarkably few bombs. If most bombing were as inaccurate as the bombing of the Leuna synthetic fuel plant, the Army Air Forces dropped nearly 1.5 million tons of bombs to get 50,000 tons to do any damage. Nevertheless, whether by several or by several hundred bombs, strategic bombing did destroy its targets. The campaign took longer than  190 Chapter 10 11 the six months AWPD/1 had foreseen, but still deprived Germany of criti- cal capabilities. The driving force behind the pursuit of true precision bombing after World War II was the recognition that so few bombs could have such substantial effects in war-if accurately aimed. America's high-altitude bombing technology in World War II was the best in the world, but inadequate for the objectives of daylight precision strategic bombing. No matter how sophisticated the aircraft, the bomb- sight, and the autopilot, no matter how well trained the bombardier and how brilliant t
