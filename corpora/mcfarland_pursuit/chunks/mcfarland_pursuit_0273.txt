for the objectives of daylight precision strategic bombing. No matter how sophisticated the aircraft, the bomb- sight, and the autopilot, no matter how well trained the bombardier and how brilliant the doctrine, once the bomb was released, daylight precision strategic bombing relied on the crudest of military technologies-simple explosives surrounded by a steel jacket. The bombardiers aiming their bomb loads at Germany's industrial infrastructure contributed mightily to victory at great cost,71 but the doctrine that sent them to bomb Germany depended on hitting the nail on the head, not the broad side of the barn. Japan's Congested and Highly Inflammable Cities B etween the world wars Army airmen looked at Japan and saw a fabric of packed cities, not industrial complexes. In his search for air-power targets, Billy Mitchell toured the Far East for six months in 1923-24. On record opposing the bombing of civilians, he believed the best means to defeat Japan would be attacks against her "congested and highly inflammable cities." The great Tokyo fire of 1923 had killed over 100,000 people-proof enough of Japan's vul- nerability to fire. Mitchell told the General Board of the Navy that "Japan is more susceptible to attack by aircraft than any other country in the world," with cities "very easily destroyed."1 The lure of Tokyo's paper and wood structures was a powerful force running counter to the convictions of daylight precision strategic bombing. Japanese victories in World War II's early days forced the Americans to fight their way across the Pacific before Army Air Forces bombers could come into range of the Japanese home islands. Honolulu was 3,400 miles from Tokyo, Sydney 4,300, and Manila 1,800. Even Tinian, destined to become a major base for the air assault on Japan, was 1,500 miles away. For three years the U.S. Navy fought the Japanese navy to bring the new B-29 long-range bomber within reach. 191  192 Chapter 11 193 Japan's Highly Inflammable Cities Army bom
