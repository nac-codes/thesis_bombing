Japanese mainland from high altitudes. In January 1944 BuOrd stopped shipping Norden bombsights to the Pacific. Six months later the Pacific Fleet officially removed Norden bombsights from its torpedo bombers because "they are not used and are not wanted as there is no interest in high altitude horizontal bombing and it is doubtful if there are many personnel in the area qualified to do this type of bombing." Ironi- cally, the chief of staff of Air Forces, Pacific Fleet, making this decision was Rear Adm. John J. Ballentine, who had supervised Norden development projects in the 1920s.6 Torpedo bombing proved nearly as ineffective as high-altitude hori- zontal bombing, though for a different reason. At Coral Sea, dive bombers wrecked the Shoho, but it took several torpedo hits before it sank. Although the torpedo bomber was still the best means of sinking a ship from the air, its vulnerability to antiaircraft fire limited its effectiveness. The Navy preserved its torpedo bomber capability through the war because dive bombers had proven unable to sink battleships. Most torpedo bombers, however, adopted the glide bombing technique, diving at a flatter angle of 40 or 50 degrees from high altitudes to minimize exposure to enemy fire. The Navy launched 1,287 aerial torpedoes during the war, achieving 514 hits (40%).7 The most famous test for naval aviation and dive bombing came at the Battle of Midway on June 4, 1942. Although naval tactics dictated a coordi- nated attack, circumstances brought the torpedo bombers of Rear Adm. Frank J. Fletcher to attack Vice Adm. Chuichi Nagumo's four aircraft car- riers alone. In a confirmation of the vulnerability of the torpedo bomber, Japanese defenders downed thirty-six out of forty-two attacking TBD Devastators. Their sacrifice stood in stark contrast to their inability to achieve a single hit. Fifty SBD Dauntless dive bombers, however, made Midway the turning point in the Pacific War.
