Fourteen of the attacking dive bombers were lost.8 Antiaircraft gunfire improved during the war, forcing dive bombers into an increasingly dangerous environment, as predicted by the Army Air Corps before the war. Dive bombers escaped to higher altitudes and re- duced accuracy, confirming the Army's experience that altitude was as much the enemy of bombing accuracy for dive bombing as for high- altitude horizontal bombing (see Figure 11.1). Naval aviators adopted the toss-bombing technique, where a bomber released its bomb during a dive at 6,000 feet. The added velocity of the bomb provided a trajectory closer to the line of sight, increasing accuracy, while the increased altitude limited exposure to defensive fire.º Navy dive bombing pushed American air bases to within B-29 striking distance of Japan by July and August 1944. Unwilling to wait and trying to keep China in the war, Army Air Forces chief Henry Arnold pushed for early operations from bases in India and China. In November 1943 Ar- nold's Committee of Operations Analysts identified six target systems for the effort: merchant shipping, steel production, urban industrial areas, air- 195 Japan's Highly Inflammable Cities craft plants, antifrictio
