point. LeMay instituted major changes to improve accuracy, based on his European expe- rience. He formed the B-29s into tight twelve-aircraft combat boxes under the direction of a lead bombardier sighting for range and deflection and flying by the C-1 automatic flight control equipment (AFCE). Bombar- diers adopted the synchronous bombing procedure by which both the op- tical Norden bombardier and radar operator controlled the bomb run.11 Despite losses, XX Bomber Command became a daylight strike force be- cause high-altitude precision bombing required daylight for accuracy.12 Three missions against the Rama VI railroad bridge at Bangkok typified the failures and successes of these early daylight precision strategic bomb- ing missions. On December 14, 1944, thirty-three B-29s missed the 1,456- foot bridge. Three weeks later forty-four aircraft gained one hit on the bridge and did substantial damage to the approaches. In February 1945 another strike put four 1,000-pound bombs on the target.  196 Chapter 11 197 Japan's Highly Inflammable Cities Table 11.1.

Also noteworthy as a portent of Japan's future was LeMay's December 15, 1944, mission against the dock area of Hankow, China. Using incendi- aries, his B-29s destroyed nearly half the heavily populated target. The significance of this area fire bombing was not lost on LeMay.13 XX Bomber Command's record was mixed, with the attack on Anshan its only notable success. Training and experience proved priceless
