eater losses of the $509,000 B-29 and its crew of eleven to thirteen airmen. Area bombing would not destroy the Japanese capability for waging war. The Air Staff and Arnold pressed him to undertake incendiary missions to Tokyo on November 29, 1944, and to Nagoya on January 3, 1945, as tests, but from high altitude the results were limited. Many fires broke out, but they were widely separated and easily controlled.18 Hansell's XXI Bomber Command achieved only one successful preci-  198 Chapter 11 199 Japan's Highly Inflammable Cities sion attack, causing serious damage to the Kawasaki Aircraft Industries plant near Akashi on January 19, 1945-too late to save Hansell's job. The next day Arnold replaced Hansell with Curtis LeMay. In the words of Brig. Gen. Lauris Norstad, Twentieth Air Force chief of staff, "LeMay is an op- erator, the rest of us are planners." He had helped save daylight precision strategic bombing in Europe. He was the man to call when Arnold wanted a job done. LeMay had no misconceptions about what was expected of him: "If you don't get results, you'll be fired."19 LeMay's initial efforts were no more successful than Hansell's. Weather. high altitudes, and high winds made bombing ineffective, including a test incendiary attack on Kobe. On February 19, 1945, Norstad assigned in- cendiary test raids priority over aircraft assembly plants and LeMay re- sponded with a maximum effort against Tokyo six days later. High altitude again limited its effectiveness, but 172 B-29s burned one square mile of built-up urban area to the ground. After four months the campaign against Japan's industrial web had not destroyed any of the nine top-priority tar- gets. The Navy had done more damage to Musashino in one attack by dive bombers than 2,148 B-29 sorties and 5,398 tons of high-altitude bombs. 20 The flammability of Japanese cities beckoned. Unable to destroy the machines of war, LeMay resolved to kill the human beings who operated the machines and to destroy the
