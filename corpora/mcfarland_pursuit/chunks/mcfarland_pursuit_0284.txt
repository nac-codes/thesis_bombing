stream and heavy cloud formations, compensated for the lost accuracy of night bombing. The X-1 Reflex Sight Attachment with coated optics to increase light transmis- sion made the Norden M-9 bombsight an acceptable aiming mechanism for night missions. Although not designed for this purpose, the APQ-13 H,X radar worked well at low altitudes. Lower altitudes and stripping the big bombers of their defensive weapons reduced gas consumption and in- creased bomb loads.22 On March 9, 282 B-29s dropped 2,000 tons of M-69 jelled-gasoline incendiaries from 7,000 feet on Tokyo by intervalometers set at 50 feet. The aiming point was a large burning cross marked by pathfinder aircraft dropping M-47 napalm bombs across a three- by four-mile rectangle in the center of the city, inhabited by more than 1 million Japanese. Packed in 500-pound clusters,23 the six-pound M-69 bomblets scattered over 15.8 square miles of Tokyo. Later crews aimed at unburned areas between fires. Fourteen aircraft went down, but high winds created a fire storm and at least 78,000 Japanese died. After the war LeMay explained his intentions: "I'll tell you what war is about-you've got to kill people, and when you've killed enough they stop fighting."24 XXI Bomber Command next struck against Nagoya on March 11. Plan- ners increased intervalometer settings to 100 feet to get a larger path of destruction, but the decreased bombing density reduced the intensity of the fires. Next came Osaka, Kobe, and Nagoya with 50-foot intervalome- ter settings. Running short on M-69 clusters, LeMay's aircraft carried M-17 magnesium thermite bombs. Although less effective against urban areas, they kept the fire-bombing campaign going. LeMay's trail of fire left five of Japan's largest cities blackened ruins (see Table 11.2). Exhaustion, the depletion of incendiary bombs, and the diversion to support the Oki- nawa invasion halted the effort. The Norden bombsight was of limited use during these raids. Altitudes were low and aim
