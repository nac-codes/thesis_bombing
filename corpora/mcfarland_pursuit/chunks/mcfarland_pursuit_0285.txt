ustion, the depletion of incendiary bombs, and the diversion to support the Oki- nawa invasion halted the effort. The Norden bombsight was of limited use during these raids. Altitudes were low and aiming points were huge bonfires. LeMay continued preci- sion bombing raids, but without success. Night precision raids from low altitude using flares proved equally futile, though an April 12 strike against  200 Chapter 11 Japan's Highly Inflammable Cities 201 Table 11.2.

Musashino finally destroyed Hansell's old nemesis. This success spurred LeMay to launch dangerous daylight strikes against the Hitachi factory in Tokyo and the Kawanishi plant in Konan from low altitudes. The Norden proved its mettle and B-29s destroyed both targets.25 With bomb stocks replenished, LeMay returned to low-altitude night incendiary missions in April. Tokyo (four times), Kawasaki, Nagoya (twice), Yokohama, Osaka (twice), and Kobe burned before incendiary bomb-depletion again diverted LeMay to precision targets. Beginning on June 9, XXI Bomber Command would strike at precision targets when the weather permitted, but use area bombing when it did not. Incendiaries were ineffective against cities already burned and LeMay had to target smaller cities, including Hachioji with only 60,000 inhabitants. Typical was the July 6 strike against Chiba, Akashi, Shimizu, and Kofu. Thick un- dercast clouds forced the 570 B-29s to use radar, sufficiently accurate that day to burn 3.25 square miles of urban area.26 Japan proved defenseless against
