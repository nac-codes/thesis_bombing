Chiba, Akashi, Shimizu, and Kofu. Thick un- dercast clouds forced the 570 B-29s to use radar, sufficiently accurate that day to burn 3.25 square miles of urban area.26 Japan proved defenseless against these raids. To intensify the effect on morale, LeMay ordered Japa- nese cities notified by leaflets of their impending destruction. In 10 months of operation, XXI Bomber Command dropped 167,736 tons of bombs, 61 percent incendiaries, at a cost of 414 B-29s. Precision bombing had not destroyed Japan's industrial web, but area bombing had burned over 150 square miles of Japanese cities and the industries within them. Despite the success of area bombing, 45.5 percent of all Twentieth Air Force sorties were for daylight precision strategic bombing. Area bombing accounted for 47.8 percent, though in the last five months of Table 11.3.

Accuracy on night incendiary missions remained poor-13 percent of incendiary bombs landing within 2,000 feet of the assigned point of impact. These were area bombing weapons, however, and considering the volatility of their targets, close was good enough.27 D
