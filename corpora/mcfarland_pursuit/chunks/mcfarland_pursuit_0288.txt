nterim Committee, assigned the responsibil- ity of planning for this new weapon, had recommended that it be aimed at a Japanese "war plant surrounded by workers' homes." The "Little Boy" atomic fission bomb killed 70,000 and destroyed 4.5 square miles of ur- ban area.29 Japan did not surrender and Twentieth Air Force ordered 131 B-29s to bomb the Toyokawa naval arsenal the next day. On the eighth, 343 bomb- ers firebombed Yawata and Fukuyama while sixty-nine more precision- bombed a Tokyo aircraft plant. With no word from Japan, 107 B-29s hit oil targets in Amagasaki while Bock's Car and Capt. Kermit K. Beahan dropped the "Fat Man" atomic bomb on Nagasaki. The Nagasaki target again complied with prewar doctrine-the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works. On August 9 25,000 died and 1.5 square miles of Nagasaki were leveled. Still, there was no word from Tokyo. More B-29s dropped conventional bombs on the ninth and tenth, before Pres. Harry Truman ordered a bombing halt for surrender negotiations. Delays and mixed signals from Japan encouraged the president to order bombing resumed on the four- teenth. Five more targets experienced precision bombing by 584 B-29s and two cities area bombing by 186 B-29s before Truman announced Japan's unconditional surrender. The United States dropped 160,800 tons of bombs on the Japanese home islands. Navy dive bombers operating from aircraft carriers ac- counted for 6,788 tons of these in sixteen strikes against precision targets from February to August 1945. When exposed to enemy land defenses and the weather difficulties of missions over Japan, naval dive bombing proved less accurate than at sea-an average circular error of 250 feet. In strikes against Japanese aircraft industries, the B-29s dropped 8 percent of their bombs on targeted structures and 8.4 percent within the open areas of the plants. Navy dive bombers averaged 14.9 percent hits on buildings and 21 percent within open areas. Army bombers missed with 83.6 percent of their bo
