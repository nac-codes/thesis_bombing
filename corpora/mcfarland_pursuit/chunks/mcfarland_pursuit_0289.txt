tures and 8.4 percent within the open areas of the plants. Navy dive bombers averaged 14.9 percent hits on buildings and 21 percent within open areas. Army bombers missed with 83.6 percent of their bombs, the Navy with 64.1 percent.30 The Navy also used gunfire against strategic targets on the Japanese home islands, but its battleships and heavy cruisers did not fare so well. In July and August 1945 naval surface vessels fired on twenty-seven industrial targets, hitting twenty-two. One ship aimed at individual buildings of the Japan Musical Instrument Company at close range, but the average error in the mean point of impact was over 3,000 feet. Even with spotter aircraft, of 802 shells fired from 10.5 miles at the Kamaishi Japan Iron Works, a target covering 182 acres, only 29 percent landed within the compound. The ships averaged 25 percent hits, roughly comparable to the accuracy of heavy bombers flying four miles up.31 At a cost of $3-4 billion and 335 lost aircraft, B-29s accounted for 91 percent of the 160,800 tons of bombs dropped on Japan. Surprisingly, Twentieth Air Force achieved a day visual and radar precision bombing average of 31 percent within 1,000 feet of the aiming point during the war-a record similar to Eighth Air Force's 32 percent and Fifteenth Air Force's 31 percent. On Norden-aimed visual missions, the Twentieth's B-29s averaged 38 percent. The average altitude of daylight precision mis- sions for the Twentieth Air Force was 4,500 feet lower than Eighth Air Force, which explained some of its success.32 Bombardiers achieved this remarkable accuracy record despite the jet stream and missions covering 3,000 miles. With such accuracy and other advantages, why did the Army Air Forces give up on daylight precision strategic bombing against Japan so quickly in favor of area bombing?33 The fight-to-the-death nature of the Pacific war convinced Americans that only an extermination campaign could defeat the Japanese.
