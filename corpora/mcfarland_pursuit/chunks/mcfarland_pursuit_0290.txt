kly in favor of area bombing?33 The fight-to-the-death nature of the Pacific war convinced Americans that only an extermination campaign could defeat the Japanese. On Tarawa seventeen Japanese soldiers survived the 4,500 who began the battle. The intensity of the fighting and the apparent willingness of the Japanese to fight to the death scared American leaders into a bombing strategy based on killing people rather than blowing up industries. An extermination campaign was the logical result. Japan's sneak attack on Pearl Harbor only served to vindicate this belief.34 LeMay claimed the switch to area bombing came because Japanese in- dustries were closely integrated into the cities. These cities were the indus- tries and the industries were the cities. Japan's economy, he argued, oper- ated with many small shops built in the homes of urban workers. He saw drill presses still standing in the ruins of civilian homes after the fire raids. These cottage industries were too small to be targets of a strategic bomb- ing campaign, but they were the choke-points in the Japanese industrial fabric. According to one Japanese author,  204 Chapter 11 Japan's Highly Inflammable Cities By the end of 1944, Japan was truly fully mobilized, and in the normal sense there were no more civilians in Japan. The government consid- ered the civilian population to be just as much an element in the prose- cution of the war as the soldiers at the front. There was no way by 1944 that civilians could be separated from the military in Japan.35 Japan's industrial output peaked in mid-1944 and began declining rapidly after that because of the Navy's blockade, not strategic bombing. Army Air Forces B-29s bombed factories already idled by the blockade. The Strate- gic Bombing Survey believed that the blockade defeated Japan, but failed to convince the Japanese leadership it had lost. B-29s were therefore left with a target the Air Corps Tactical School faculty had not considered. Strategic bombing had
