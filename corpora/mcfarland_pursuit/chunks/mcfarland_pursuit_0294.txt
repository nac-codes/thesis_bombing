bombardier error. The inaccuracy was embarrassing, but a yield of 3.75 megatons made it hardly critical.4 New electronic devices with transistors made the gears, cogs, and discs of the Norden bombsight obsolescent. The B-50D, RB-36, and B-45 bombers used the AN/APQ-24 radar bombsight, which could achieve ac- curacies within 625 feet from an altitude of 25,000 feet under all weather conditions-close enough for nuclear weapons. The B-47 and B-52 bombers carried K-1 and K-2 bombing and navigational systems, combin- ing the AN/APQ-31 bombing radar system, an electromechanical analog computer, and a Y-1 optical periscopic bombsight. Built by Sperry, the sys- tem weighed 1,700 pounds, had 79,000 parts, and used 410 vacuum tubes. Early electronics did not mean simplicity and reduced weight.5 On the horizon were various bombing and navigation systems based on ground radio transmissions, including SHORAN (short-range navigation) and LORAN (long-range navigation), and space-based GPS (global posi- tioning systems). By the 1980s and 1990s electro-optic targeting systems based on forward-looking infrared sensors with laser designators replaced bombsights. LANTIRNs (low-altitude navigation and targeting infrared for night), AN/AVQ-26 Pave Tacks, and Pave Pennys were the "Norden 206  208 Epilogue Epilogue bombsights" of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, truly dropping pickles into pickle barrels. In principle these aiming systems were as simple as "X marks the spot."6 The company Carl Norden formed with Ted Barth also changed in the Cold War. In 1944 Carl L. Norden, Inc., formed a research and develop- ment subsidiary named Norden Laboratories, Inc., mainly to prepare for entering commercial fields after the war. When bombsight operations ended in November 1945, Carl L. Norden, Inc., and Norden Laboratories moved to White Plains, New York. The Veterans Administration took over Norden's two buildings in New York at 80 Lafayette Street and 50 Varick Street. Carl Norden retired and left th
