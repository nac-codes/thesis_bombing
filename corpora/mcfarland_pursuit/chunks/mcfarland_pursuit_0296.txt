in cost overruns.9 As the Cold War wound down, military contracts ran out. One notable exception was the JSTARS battlefield surveillance system that, although rushed into battle with Norden technicians still manning the equipment, proved spectacularly successful in identifying the pell-mell Iraqi retreat from Kuwait along the "Highway of Death" during the Gulf War. In 1994 United Technologies sold its money-losing subdivision to Westinghouse. With few commercial applications, the future does not look promising for Norden's successor company. Of Carl Norden, his bombsight brought sufficient wealth to separate him from postwar financial concerns. He never saw his bombsight as an instrument of destruction, but as a means for shortening wars and reducing casualties through the precision bombing of military and industrial targets. His wife occasionally chastised him for being a "merchant of death," but he never expressed any concern for financial profits (that was Barth's job) and always insisted he was trying to make war more humane. He fled into retirement in Switzerland after the war to escape the attention his bomb- sight brought him. It was a self-imposed exile because he wanted nothing to do with postwar weapons of mass destruction. According to his son, the inventor of the most precise optical bombsight ever developed never knew his device had been used to aim the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Religiously, "it would have destroyed him."10 He died on June 15, 1965, at age 85 in Zurich from tongue cancer, no doubt connected to his life-long cigar addiction. Norden's bombsight was the key technology behind the development of daylight precision strategic bombing in the United States. It held out the prospect of winning wars quickly with minimized casualties. Although nuclear war was the antithesis of daylight precision strategic bombing, the memory of World War II was sufficient to delude millions of Americans into believing that the American way of wa
