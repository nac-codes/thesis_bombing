s. Although nuclear war was the antithesis of daylight precision strategic bombing, the memory of World War II was sufficient to delude millions of Americans into believing that the American way of war was the most humane on earth, attacking the machines of war rather than the human beings behind the machines of war. Strategic bombing combined the American love of technology with the American desire to keep losses on both sides, but espe- cially on the American side, to a minimum. Although this was not his in- tention, Carl Norden had dehumanized war, making it impersonal and without guilt-waging war against nonliving, unfeeling, cold assemblages of metal and concrete. He had helped to make war more tolerable. Several decades of living under the threat of thermonuclear war and two large "brush-fire" wars in Asia made war less sufferable, at least until highly ac- curate television and laser-guided bombing again seemed to make war more tolerable. The Gulf War proved, however, as World War II had with the Norden bombsight, that clouds, smoke, dust, enemy defenses, the need for timely and accurate intelligence, expense, and chance remain constants in war. Coalition forces dropped 17,000 precision guided munitions into the "pickle barrel" in that war, but also 210,000 conventional "dumb" bombs missing by an average of over 300 feet. War remains war. Precision bombing of buildings and machines means fewer people will die, but people will still die.
