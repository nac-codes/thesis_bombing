World wars could be fought more quickly, with less destruction, and at reduced cost. Bombsights performed two basic functions for finding that one point in the sky from where a bomb, when dropped, would hit its target. First the sight had to allow the bomb-carrying aircraft to fly on a track so that when released the bomb landed on a line parallel to the track of the aircraft that intersected the target. This was the deflection problem. The difference between the longitudinal axis of the airplane and the actual track the aircraft followed on the ground, caused by wind, was called the drift angle. The ground distance between a point directly under the aircraft at the time that the bomb hit the ground to the point where the bomb lands because of cross winds and air resistance was trail. For a 500-pound bomb dropped from 20,000 feet by a bomber traveling at 160 MPH, the trail would be approximately 2,300 feet (with no wind). Adjusting the bombsight's drift vector solved the deflection problem. Successive observations of the target through the bombsight's telescope determined the drift angle. The aircraft then flew on a head- ing that insured the ground track would intersect the target. The bombsight com- puter also calculated the additional change in heading needed to compensate for the influence of the cross wind on the bombs as they dropped. Second, the sight had to calculate the lead time necessary to allow the bomb to travel along the proper deflection track to the target. This was the range problem- the distance from the point where the aircraft dropped its bomb to the target. Determined mathematically, range was a calculation of the effect of gravity on a 221  222 A
