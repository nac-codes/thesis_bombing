. This was the range problem- the distance from the point where the aircraft dropped its bomb to the target. Determined mathematically, range was a calculation of the effect of gravity on a 221  222 Appendix D 223 The Bombsighting Problem Table D.1. Time of Bomb Fall (160 MPH release speed) 1,100-pound bomb (in seconds) 600-pound bomb Altitude (feet) (in seconds) 11.25 18.00 2,000 feet 11.25 5,000 feet 18.00 25.75 25.50 10,000 feet 30.50 30.75 14,000 feet 18,000 feet 35.00 34.75 20,000 feet 36.75 37.25 bomb. This acceleration toward the ground varied as to geographical location, but was approximately 32 feet per second per second in a vacuum. The bombsight combined gravity and the aircraft's ground speed, determined by measuring the changes between the sighting angle to the target and a vertical line directly beneath the aircraft, to solve the range problem. The vertical force of gravity added to the horizontal force of the releasing air- craft's forward motion determined the parabolic trajectory of the falling bomb. The resulting bomb range was the distance the bomb traveled from the point on the earth's surface directly beneath the point of release to the point where its para- bolic arc intersected the earth's surface at the target. In a vacuum the only input needed for accurate bombing in range was the ground speed of the aircraft, the altitude, and some means for releasing the bomb at exactly the proper range from the target. For a B-17 cruising at 160 MPH at an altitude of 23,000 feet, the time of fall of a 600-pound M-32 bomb would be approximately 38 seconds, giving a bomb range of 8,875 feet. Already the inherent errors of the procedure should be clear- if the speed calculation was off by 2 MPH and the altitude by 25 feet, the bomb range differed by 115 feet (see Table D.1). Altimeters were therefore critical to the achievement of accuracy in bombing. Initially these were inaccurate aneroid barometers, using scales marked in feet rather than in pounds of atm
