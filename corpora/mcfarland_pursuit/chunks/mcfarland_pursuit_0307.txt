he influence of wind. This was why most early bombsights required a bomb run directly up- or downwind, translating the influences of the wind into a factor that could be negated with adjustments for aircraft ground speed (true air speed plus or minus the influence of wind). For most bombsights, range was a matter of the sighting angle, or the angle formed by a vertical line from the aircraft to the ground, and the line of sight from the aircraft to the target. The bombsight determined the bombing range, which was the distance on the earth's surface from the line of sight to the vertical line from the aircraft to the ground, compensating for trail. This was the point of release. The complexity of the bombsighting problem can best be seen in diagram form (see Figure D.1). Indicative of the difficulty of the bombsighting problem is the theoretical error that individual factors contribute to the inaccuracy of a bombsighting operation (see Table D.2). Inherent errors in bombsights and bombardiers increased with altitude. Billy Mitchell's bombers in the 1921 ship-bombing tests could depend on the odds in-  224 Appendix D The Bombsighting Problem 225 LOVE WIND DIRECTION RELEASE POINT HEADING OF PLANE COURSE OF PLANE COLLISION COURSE !

Air Corps strategists formulated plans for war based on bombing tests from 8,000 feet, but even at this altitude accuracy errors were expanding beyond the destructive powers of Air Corps bombs. A bomb depends on over-pressure, temperature, and fragmentation of the bomb casing (shrapnel) to damage or destroy a target. A cubic foot of TNT (trini- trotoluene) on explosion releases about 10,000 cubic feet of gas at a temperature of about 2,800°℃. This gas expands at about 8,000 feet per se
