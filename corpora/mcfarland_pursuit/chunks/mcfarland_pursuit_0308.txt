damage or destroy a target. A cubic foot of TNT (trini- trotoluene) on explosion releases about 10,000 cubic feet of gas at a temperature of about 2,800°℃. This gas expands at about 8,000 feet per second, achieving an over-pressure of 147,000 psi. This destructive force results in cratering when the bomb hits the earth and declines quickly because of the tamping effect of the soil (see Table D.3). The fragmentation effect declines with distance (see Table D.4). At 25,000 feet, errors made precision bombing a matter of luck and providence. Table D.2.

The biggest problem facing Army and Navy engineers was to develop a bomb- sight that was not too complex to render it useless under operational conditions It would have to solve the above problems, while striking a compromise between accuracy and simplicity
