develop a bomb- sight that was not too complex to render it useless under operational conditions It would have to solve the above problems, while striking a compromise between accuracy and simplicity of operation. Initial World War I sights had been the es sence of simplicity, relying mainly on luck for a hit. As surface defenses forced aircraft to drop bombs from greater altitudes, luck was not enough. World War I research tried to determine the correct range setting for the time of drop using mechanical means. The critical component was determining the ground speed of the aircraft, using it to set the correct range angle or point of release. Bombardiers determined ground speed by "timing" the motion of the air- craft over the ground, by calculating the vector sums of the wind and the aircraft's air speed, or by "synchronizing" a moving component of the bombsight with the aircraft's motion over the ground. All three added significant complexity to the bombsight. In the timing technique, the crew used a stopwatch or similar device to measure the time required to fly over a predetermined angle or distance on the ground. On a sight with a movable telescope, this meant measuring the time required to fly over the same object on the ground during the telescope's swing through a prede- termined arc. On a sight with a fixed telescope, the bombardier measured the time required to fly over the same object on the ground from the point the object passed through the front cross wire until the object passed t ed through the rear cross wire. A variation was to measure the time required to fly over a known distance on the ground. Because the distance measured on the ground varied as to altitude, tables or scales were required to transfer time into ground speed. Another variation was to fix the front cross wire on the target for a period equal to the number of second it would take for the bomb to fall from that altitude to the target. The operator moved the rear cross wire back an
