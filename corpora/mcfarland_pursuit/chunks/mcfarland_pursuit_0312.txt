g accuracy. Expense, manufacturing difficulties, and the problem of achieving the necessary degree of stabilization hindered the development of the synchronous sight, despite its theo- retical advantages over the timing sight. World War I bombsights generally used the vector-sum or timing methods. Bombsights of the 1920s, including the Estoppey D-1 through D-4 and the Nor- den Mark XI, employed the timing method. Both the Norden M-series and Sperry S-1 bombsights of World War II used the synchronous method.2  Appendix E Operation of the Norden Mark 15/M-Series Bombsight I. PREPARATION FOR BOMBING RUN-to be performed 30 to 45 minutes before the airplane is expected to reach the target area. A. Check stabilizer gyro to insure that gyro is operating and has attained normal running speed before proceeding further. B. Check torque motor to insure torque motor is operating. C. Check PDI to insure PDI system is operating properly. D. Turn on bombsight gyro by moving the bombsight toggle switch to the "ON" position. E. Align bombsight clutch by aligning the course centering marks on the bomb- sight clutch connecting rod with the course centering pointer. F. Make train bombing adjustment. If train bombing is to be used the sight should be adjusted to place the mean point of impact on the target. Loosen the knurled nut on the trail spotting arm, moving the trail arm to the correct mil value, and tightening the knurled nut on the trail spotting arm. G. Compute true air speed and bombing altitude using the E-6B computer, or equivalent. H. Set disc speed and trail from the bombing tables and set this data into the sight. 1. Set the disc speed into the sight by turning the altitude knob in a clockwise direction. Make sure the "change speed" lever is in the correct position. a. Move the telescope motor toggle switch to the "ON" position and check disc speed with a type 43D-3 bombsight disc speed tachometer. 229  230 Appendix E 231 Operation of Norden Mark 15/M-Series Bombsight b.
