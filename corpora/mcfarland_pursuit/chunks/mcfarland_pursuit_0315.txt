taken, disengage autopilot clutch to permit turning the airplane with the bombardier's turn knob. H. Start evasive action, if these tactics are to be employed during the approach to the target. These maneuvers, when employed, will be limited to turns of from 5 degrees to 15 degrees and the time on each leg will be from 10 to 20 seconds. The bombardier will turn the airplane in these maneuvers by moving the bom- bardier's turn knob in the appropriate direction and amount. These turns should be planned so as to gradually work the airplane upwind so that the final turn onto the target can be made in a downwind direction. 1. Level the bombsight gyro, if necessary, by using the leveling knobs to center the bubbles in the spirit-type levels mounted on the gyro housing. 2. Hold the bombsight manually to keep the line of sight on the target until the bombsight clutch is engaged to stabilize the bombsight in azimuth. 3. Move the horizontal cross hair back on the target with the displacement knob. 4. Make a note of the sighting angle which will indicate the time to turn onto the target to complete a bombing run of the desired duration. This value can be obtained from the automatic bombing computer, or the bombing tables, for 30-second runs. For runs of longer or shorter duration the proper sighting angle will have been computed on the ground before takeoff. 5. Watch the telescope sector indicator for the time to turn on the target for the bombing run and plan the evasive action accordingly. 6. Stop evasive action and turn the airplane on the target for the bombing run when the telescope sector indicator reaches the sighting angle that signals the start of a bombing run of the desired duration. I. Obtain drift angle from the automatic bombing computer, or from the E-6B computer, and turn the airplane, while holding the line of sight on the target, until the correct drift angle is indicated on the drift scale. Engage the bombsight clutch as soon as the drift has been preset. J
