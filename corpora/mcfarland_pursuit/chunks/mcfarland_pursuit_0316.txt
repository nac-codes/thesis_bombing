and turn the airplane, while holding the line of sight on the target, until the correct drift angle is indicated on the drift scale. Engage the bombsight clutch as soon as the drift has been preset. J. Place the vertical cross hair on the target with the turn knob. Double grip the turn and drift knobs to stop relative motion between the cross hair and the tar- get. Only very fine adjustments should be required, inasmuch as this operation will consist simply of refining the course that was established when the drift angle was preset. K. Check level of bombsight gyro to make sure the airplane is flying straight and level. L. Place the horizontal cross hair on the target with the displacement knob. Use the rate knob to stop relative motion between the cross hair and the target. Care should be exercised not to overcontrol at this point. Only very fine adjustments  232 Appendix E of the rate knob should be required, inasmuch as this operation will consist sim- ply of refining the rate that was established when the dropping angle was preset. M. Move the release lever up to firing position and lock in firing position by moving the lever upward to the limit of its travel and pressing the small locking pin into the operative position. N. Extreme caution must be taken not to overcontrol at this point. If the preced- ing operations have been carefully performed, a good course and a good rate have been established. Any adjustment made at this point should only be for the purpose of removing any very small errors still present. The gear ratios are such that any major adjustments at this time in course and/or rate may well result in much larger bombing errors than if the small remaining errors are accepted and the cross hairs moved back on the target by means of the turn and displace- ment knobs. O. When the telescope sector indicator drives into coincidence with the rate sector indicator bombs are released automatically. P. Notify the pilot that the bombs have been released. Q.
