g mission immediately preceding bomb release. Also bombing approach. 233  234 Glossary 235 Glossary CEP (Circular Error Probable) Measure of accuracy and reliability of bombing. Expressed as radius of a circle within which at least 50 percent of bombs dropped will land. Circular error Distance from a given point of impact, or from the mean point of impact of a pattern of bombs, to the center of the target, measured as the ra- dius of a circle around the point of impact, or the mean point of impact of a pat- tern of bombs. Often given as circular error probable (CEP), which was .939 times the arithmetic mean circular error. Also equal to 1.746 multiplied by the square root of the product of the range error probable and the deflection error probable (1.746 VR, Â· D). Crosstrail Distance between the true course of the airplane and the collision course to the target or distance that ground track of aircraft must be aligned upwind. Dead reckoning Estimating an aircraft's position at a given time by calculating heading, time, speed, and wind from a known position. Used in bombing from or through clouds or overcast. Deflection Distance measured on the ground from the point directly under an aircraft on a track parallel to the target to the target. Deflection error The distance from a given point of impact, or from the mean point of impact of a bombing pattern, to the center of the target measured per- pendicular to the direction of approach (normal to the ground track). Often given as deflection error probable (DEP), which was .845 times the arithmetic mean deflection error. Dive bombing Descending from high-altitude horizontal flight to low altitude at an angle of between 70 degrees and 90 degrees from the horizontal in Navy us- age, or above 30 degrees from the horizontal in Army usage, releasing the bomb or bombs just prior to recovery from the dive. Drift angle Difference between the longitudinal axis of an airplane or heading and the actual track the aircraft followed
