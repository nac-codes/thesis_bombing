ight mecha- nism to match the movement of the aircraft over a fixed point on the ground. Measurement of the movement of an aircraft relative to a fixed point on the ground. Tamping Filling in above an explosive charge to increase its power. Achieved in mining effect when bombs are dropped from high altitude. Time of fall Time duration from bomb release to bomb impact, roughly equal to the square root of the altitude divided by 16.08 (vAlt/16.08). Timing technique Use of stopwatch to measure the time required to fly over the same object on the ground, measured during the swing of a bombsight's tele- scope through a predetermined arc or from the movement of the object from the front cross hair to the back cross hair in a bombsight's telescope, in order to deter- mine ground speed. Measurement of a fixed point's movement relative to the air- craft. Trail Horizontal distance measured on the ground that a bomb lags behind the airplane that dropped it. Distance from the point of impact of a bomb to a point directly beneath the airplane that dropped it at the instant of bomb impact. Train bombing Dropping two or more bombs in succession at predetermined intervals (using an intervalometer) from the same airplane to achieve dispersal across an area target. Trajectory The path of a bomb through the air from the point of release to the point of impact. True air speed Velocity of aircraft through air, including influences of wind. Water-hammer effect Result of a bombing near-miss, wherein the weight of thousands of tons of water focus the force of the exploding bomb against the hull of a ship. Yaw Movement of an airplane around its vertical axis (from ventral to dorsal).
