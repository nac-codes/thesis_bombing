Broun, who tested the Norden Mark XV for the Navy at Dahlgren Naval Proving Ground in 1934, said, "It was called the pickle-barrel sight because of its accuracy." See McCollum, ed., Dahlgren, 36. Time magazine wrote in 1939 that the Army Air Corps could "drop a bomb into a barrel from 18,000 feet." See "In the Air," Time, October 23, 1939 33.
