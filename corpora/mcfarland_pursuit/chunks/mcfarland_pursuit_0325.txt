Ted" Barth, in the 1930s president of Carl L. Norden, Inc., which manufactured the bombsight. Barth was a genius at public relations and a guess that Barth coined the phrase would not be without foundation. 12.

See Manhattan Project: Official History and Documents, Reel 2, Pt. 7, Vol. 5, p. 2.6. Leslie Groves, director of the project, recorded that only $2.191 billion of the $2.3-billion allocation was actually spent, making the costs of the Norden project equal to 68 percent of the Manhattan Project. See Leslie R. Groves, Now It Can Be Told: The Story of the Manhattan Project (New York: Da Capo, 1962), 360. 16. The Army Air Forces procured 81,537 Norden bombsights, models M-1 through M 9B, the Navy 8,353. A 1942 contract for the bombsights called for a unit price of $8,500. Each bombsight also needed an autopilot/bombing approach apparatus ($5,000), a glide bombing attachment on some versions ($3,300), stabilizers, disc speed tachometers, rotor speed ta- chometers, pilot direction indicators, reflex sight attachments, low-altitude attachments, tan- gent scale kits, steering motors, formation sticks, rate end computers, spare parts, and so on. For the entire project, $1.5 billion, including government funds to expand production, is a conservative estimate.
