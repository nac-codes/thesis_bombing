of letters from women willing to sacrifice their long hair in the interests of the national defense. Late in the war, after much of the secrecy associated with the Norden had been peeled away, the Army notified prospective sources of human hair that "although a cross-hair design is produced in Army Air Forces' bombsights, it is not made by using either spider webs or blond hair as is often believed." See, for example, ACAS/Materiel, Mainte- nance and Distribution to Mrs. Elliott Dexter, May 1, 1944, File 452.26, Box 1277, Central Decimal Files, Oct. 1942-44, Textual Records of the Army Air Forces, Record Group 18, National Archives (hereafter RG18). Evidently the confusion was tied to the unfortunate terminology of "cross hairs." If the synonym "cross wires" had been used, most people would have assumed metal wires were used. The pieces of glass were heat-fused and human hair or spider silk would not have survived the heat of the fusing process. 19. LeMay and Kantor, Mission with LeMay, 265. Chapter 1.
