LÃ©on Foucault discovered the gyroscope while trying to demonstrate the rotation of the earth in 1851. Although others had worked with gyroscopes before, Sperry's 1907 patent was for a gyroscope mounted on pivots instead of a fixed mount, incorporating the principle of precession into an active rather than passive device. 25.

Lawrence Sperry called his device a mechanical pilot, while others preferred gyropilot or aeroplane stabilizer. After Sperry won the French award, the French press first used the term "automatic pilot." See Charles L.
