Hull personally promoted the sale of a book, Winged Warfare, authored by Henry Arnold, chief of the Air Corps, and Ira Eaker, who would lead Eighth Air Force in Europe during World War II. When Eaker went to England to set up Eighth Air Force he took then Lt. Harris B. Hull along as his A-2 (intelligence) officer. Eaker also took Capt. Frederick W. Castle, an officer in the Sperry Company before the war, to serve on his staff. Another officer serving with Eaker was Hugh Knerr, who had resigned from the Air Corps in 1939 to go to work for the Sperry Company. The Navy forced Sperry to fire Knerr in 1942 as a result of a series of articles he wrote for American Mercury in support of strategic bombing and critical of the Navy. Recalled to active duty in the Army Air Forces, Knerr went to England and took command of the Air Service Command in Europe, responsible for maintenance and supply, including bombsights, in Eaker's Eighth Air Force. See Murray Green, "Hugh J. Knerr: The Pen and the Sword," in Frisbee, ed., Makers of the United States Air Force, 99-126; Knerr papers, File 168.7028-1, HRA; and Parton, "Air Force Spoken Here," 111, 120, 131-32. With this Sperry connection, it is testimony to the integrity of these men that none intervened in favor of the Sperry bombsight during the war. 29.
