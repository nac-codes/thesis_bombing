Elmer A. Sperry Jr. told his audience at the Fifth Lester D. Gardner Lecture, May 1. 1963, that Hugh Knerr was responsible for the Air Corps' decision to build an autopilot. based on his argument that a lightweight autopilot would eliminate the need for one member of a bomber crew, thereby making room for more bombs. See transcript, Folder-Automatic Airplane Pilot, Box 30, Series V, Elmer Sperry Papers. 42. Sperry and the Army had discussed autopilot development since 1922. The Army unofficially encouraged Sperry to seek foreign sales to pay for development.
