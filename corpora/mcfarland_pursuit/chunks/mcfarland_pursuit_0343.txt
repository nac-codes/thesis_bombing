Sperry Jr., assignor to Sperry Gyroscope Company, "Automatic Control of Aircraft," U.S. Patent Office, No. 1,859,752 (filed June 29, 1928, awarded May 24, 1932). The Boeing 247 was the first com- mercial aircraft equipped with the Sperry automatic pilot. See M. Gould Beard and Percy Halpert, "Automatic Flight Control in Air Transportation," Sperry Engineering Review 8 (May-June 1955): 2-9. 47.

In a private correspondence, Foulois stated the following reasons for developing the autopilot: navigation aid, pilot relief, fog flying, aerial mapping, aerial torpedo control, and bombing, intending for the autopilot to be connected directly to the bombsight to eliminate the need for pilot direction indicators. See Foulois to Gillmore, January 25, 1930, File 452.7, Folder- Automatic Pilot, Box 630, RD-3250, RG342. 48. A critical technology of the A-1 was Sperry's development of an air-stabilized gyro- scope. Acceleration of the aircraft and bearing friction tended to make the gyroscope precess in a direction at right angles to the force of the acceleration or friction. This caused the autopilot to engage and apply correcting action when not necessary. Sperry directed an air stream at pendulum vanes covering four exhaust ports in the shaft space at the bottom of the gyroscope. When acceleration or friction caused gyroscopic precession, the gyroscope fol- lowed the vertical seeking pendulums, compensating and maintaining the true vertical.
