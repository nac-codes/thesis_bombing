ped dummy bombs against the radio-controlled Agamemnon with DH-9As from 6,000 to 14,000 feet in 1923. Dropping one bomb at a time, airmen achieved only 10 hits out of 223 bombs dropped. In July 1924 they failed to hit the ship with 114 bombs. The only live bombs used were against the HMS Monarch, but were placed against the hull and on the deck, not dropped. See Stephen Roskill, Naval Policy between the Wars, Vol. 1, The Period of Anglo- American Antagonism, 1919-1929 (London: Collins, 1968), 248-49. 5. The first target was the war prize German submarine U-117 on June 21, 1921, 50 miles off Cape Charles. Twelve 163-pound bombs with two to four direct hits sent it to the bottom in only 16 minutes. The second test was a tougher nut-the ex-USS Iowa. This radio- controlled battleship withstood two direct hits by 520-pound bombs out of 80 dropped. This test helped to convince the Navy that greater bombing accuracy was needed. The tests accel- erated with attacks on a surrendered German destroyer, G-102, sunk on July 13, 1921. A rain of 25-pound bombs had little effect, but seven hits by 300-pounders did. Again, accuracy was wanting-seven hits out of forty-four bombs dropped. The German cruiser Frankfurt on July 18 was next. Mitchell's aircraft dropped forty-four bombs and got four hits, the Navy seven of thirty-one. 6. The Army tried to begin a new round of ship-bombing tests in 1925, but the Navy claimed there were no surplus ships available.

Schornstheimer concluded that aircraft could not hit and damage maneuvering ships equippe
