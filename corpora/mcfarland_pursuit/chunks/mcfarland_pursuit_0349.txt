Foxworth, The Speed Seekers (New York: Double- day, 1976), wrote that Mitchell used "the earliest successful gyroscope-stabilized automatic bombsight" of Seversky in the tests (13). The Seversky C-series bombsights were just begin- ning research and development and were neither available nor successful at the time of the ship-bombing tests. The Sperry Company had begun its research on a stabilized bombsight in 1920, but had no sight ready for the Mitchell tests.
