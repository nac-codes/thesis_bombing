Flight Commander Edmonds of the HMS Ben-My-Chree, a seaplane carrier, dropped an 800-pound torpedo from his Short Type 184 aircraft at a 5,000-ton Turkish supply ship in August 1915-the first "kill" for an aerial torpedo. Ironically, a British submarine had already sunk the Turkish ship; Edmonds sank a ship beached by its crew. 48. Wagner, American Combat Planes, 107-16, 348-50. 49.
