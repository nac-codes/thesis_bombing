The Navy measured the accuracy of its bombsights in mils, not feet or circular error. The number of mils of error was the bombing error on the ground, measured in feet, divided by one one-thousandth of the altitude. For consistency, the author has presented all accuracy measurements converted to feet of error, not mils. The mils method can be misleading. The accuracy of a bombsight in mils does not change as the altitude increases. According to the Navy system, a bombsight with an accuracy of 10 mils would always be accurate to 10 mils regardless of altitude, which provides a false sense of precision. At 5,000 feet this bombsight would have a circular error of 50 feet, while at 20,000 feet the circular error would be 200 feet. 7. Brown, "Navy's Mark 15 (Norden) Bombsight," 86-89. 8. James B.
