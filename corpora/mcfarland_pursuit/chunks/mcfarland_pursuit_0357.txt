this bombsight would have a circular error of 50 feet, while at 20,000 feet the circular error would be 200 feet. 7. Brown, "Navy's Mark 15 (Norden) Bombsight," 86-89. 8. James B. Sykes to Capt.

Known as "gross bombing errors," both the Army and Navy, in peace and war, routinely excluded bomb drops over a certain distance from the target from their accuracy calculations. Two hundred bombs landing 100 feet from a target would give an average circular error of 100 feet. Ten more landing two miles away because of a navigational error would give an overall average circular error of 598 feet if not excluded. 10. McCollum, ed., Dahlgren, 19, 71, 79; and Jacobs, Scientist and His Experiences, 76-83, 165-67, 170. Jacobs also claimed that after the war BuOrd contracted with Norden Labora- tories to design the AN/ASB-1 bombsight, which he described as terribly inaccurate. This Norden bombsight received the approval of the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern,  Notes to Pages 72-77 258 1 t I 259 Notes to Pages 77-84 California, under the direction of Dr. L. T. E. Thompson. BuOrd's chief negotiator for the AN/ASB-1 was Robert Adams, brother of Paul Adams, who had just purchased Norden Labo- ratories. After the Navy had contracted to buy the new bombsight, Thompson and Robert Adams went to work for Norden Laboratories. 11.
