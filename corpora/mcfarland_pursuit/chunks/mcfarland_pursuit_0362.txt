Germany ran similar bombing tests in the prewar era, though typical of Hitler's flair for the grandiose, the Luftwaffe built its own testing ground at Fassberg in late 1935, including full-sized steel-reinforced concrete and steel truss bridges. Bombing experiments convinced the Luftwaffe that delayed fuzes were best against concrete targets, while instantaneous fuzes were best for steel targets.
