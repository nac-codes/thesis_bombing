led for the development of a strategic bomber force in 1923, reinforcing the more highly publicized efforts of Gen. Billy Mitchell, but to no end. 3. Sherman, Air Warfare, 210-18. 4.

Parton, "Air Force Spoken Here," 108-9, claims that Hugh Knerr was primarily responsi- ble for the development of this doctrine. Knerr was not at the ACTS during the years of doctrinal formation. Knerr's outspoken support for the bomber and the resulting reaction led him to retire from the Air Corps in 1939, when he went to work for the Sperry Gyroscope Company. 6. Herbert A. Dargue Papers, File 168.7119-2, HRA; Laurence S. Kuter, "Maj. Gen. H. A. Bert Dargue: A Lesson in Leadership," Air Force Magazine 62 (February 1979): 80-82; and H. A. Dargue, "Bombardment Aviation and Its Relation to Antiaircraft Defense," Coast Artillery Journal 77 (September-October 1934): 333-35. Dargue's relationship with Barth went back to World War I, where Dargue served as a flight instructor in France, while Barth commanded the Army's gas mask production program. Through the 1920s and 1930s Dargue and his family vacationed regularly with Barth, including a number of camping trips to Maine. Barth's apartment became a hotel for the Dargue family whenever they visited New York. Dargue was Barth's primary source for tickets to the annual Army-Navy football game. Had he survived a plane crash near Bishop, California, on December 12, 1941, on his way to investigate the fiasco at Pearl Harbor, Dargue certainly would have been one of the key lead- ers of the air war. 7.
