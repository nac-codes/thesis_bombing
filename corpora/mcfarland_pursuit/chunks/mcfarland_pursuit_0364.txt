This edition of the basic school text, authored by Walker, was the most precise and informative of all the ACTS texts covering two decades. Most were masterpieces of generality and abstraction. Walker's text discussed the capabilities of bombsights and identified the types of bombs to be used against different tar- gets. It explained the damages wrought by aerial bombs, the degree of cratering resulting from delayed fuzes, the danger zones for bomb fragmentation, and the mathematical proba- bilities of hitting a target based on the results of the Langley Annual Bombing and Machine Gun Matches. It was here that Walker wrote for a generation of Air Corps leaders that low-altitude bombing was more accurate than high, but was less effective because bombs rolled when dropped from low altitudes and failed to achiev
