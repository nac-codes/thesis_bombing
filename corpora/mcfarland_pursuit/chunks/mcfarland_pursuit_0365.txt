lker wrote for a generation of Air Corps leaders that low-altitude bombing was more accurate than high, but was less effective because bombs rolled when dropped from low altitudes and failed to achieve penetration and the min- ing effect. 14. Instructors at ACTS at the time included lieutenant colonels Donald Wilson and Edgar Sorenson; Maj. Muir Fairchild; captains Ralph Snavely, Laurence Kuter, and Hoyt Vandenberg; and first lieutenants Haywood Hansell Jr. and Leonard Harman. 15.

Claire Chennault, who criticized the planners for their conviction that large bombers would always get through. Chennault did not criticize, however, the underlying industrial fabric concept. 19.

The average radial error in this case has been determined by Kenneth Walker's formula: 1.746 multiplied by the square root of the range error multiplied by the deflection error or CEP = 1.746VR,.D.  1 t S 1 B dr Notes to Pages 94-100 262 263 Notes to Pages 101-106 t 1 11 C a b m sa ca re an ge bo 20.
