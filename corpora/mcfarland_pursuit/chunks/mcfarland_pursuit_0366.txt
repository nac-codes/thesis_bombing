The 500-pound bomb actually weighed 496 pounds, with the TNT (trinitrotoluene) filling accounting for 266 pounds. One reason for the overestimation of its destructive power was tests indicating that tamping resulting from high-altitude drops increased the explosive effect of the bomb by 4.5 times. 21.

File 167.5-45, HRA. Probability studies prepared earlier for the doctrine makers indicated that it took first-class bombardiers 1.5 aircraft, each dropping one bomb, to get a 70 percent assurance of a hit on a 100- by 600-foot target from 12,000 feet. With second-class bombar- diers it required 2.5 aircraft. With third-class bombardiers four aircraft were required. The training group with the best bombing record in 1941, the 4th Composite Group, required six aircraft to achieve a 70 percent assurance of at least one hit. An average group suc
