craft were required. The training group with the best bombing record in 1941, the 4th Composite Group, required six aircraft to achieve a 70 percent assurance of at least one hit. An average group such as the 11th required ten and the lowest ranking group, the 12th, required thirty. 27.

Copp, Few Great Captains, 397, writes that Maj. Gen. Frank M. Andrews, commanding general of GHQAF, requested the effort on August 14, 1937, because the Navy dismissed the Air Corps' success on the thirteenth. LeMay and Kantor, Mission with LeMay, 142-52, record the Navy demanding the effort of August 14 in order to prove that Navy ships could escape high-altitude bombing through evasive maneuvers. 31.
