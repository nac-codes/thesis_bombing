The Army developed three dive-bombing sights for its own use during World War II under the pressure of field units clamoring for anything to improve bombing accuracy: the K-2 "Peanut," the AN/ASG-10 "Integrator," and the A-1 Davis-Draper. None were available un- til late in the war and the Army Air Forces judged them inaccurate and impracticable. In World War II the Navy used Arabic numbers to designate equipment formerly assigned Ro- man numerals. The Navy also redesignated the Norden Mark 2 Aiming Angle Sight the Mark 16 and began a simplified Mark 17 version in April 1942. 8.
