ion of the Army Air Forces Herbert A. Dargue visited his old friend Ted Barth at Carl L. Norden. Inc., to discover the reason for the slow delivery of bombsights. Barth blamed BuOrd for all problems, feeling direct negotiations between the Army and Norden were the only solution. Dargue duly reported Barth's recommendation to Arnold and in late July 1941 Assistant Sec- retary of War for Air Robert A. Lovett asked Undersecretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal to allow such direct negotiations. Forrestal denied the request, citing the need to control Norden bombsight production because it was of "greatest usefulness against moving targets [and was] of vital importance to the Navy."

In a licensing agreement with the German firm of Askania Werke A.G., Sperry supplied Germany and its air force with a much-needed, efficient autopilot. 19.
