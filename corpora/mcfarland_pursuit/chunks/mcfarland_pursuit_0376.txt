Bates, assignor to Sperry Gyroscope Company, "Bomb Sight," U.S. Pa- tent Office, No. 1,783,769 (filed June 1, 1926, awarded December 2, 1930), and Bates, "Bombsight Alignment and Rudder Control." 21. One year earlier BuAer had asked BuOrd to link the Norden Mark XI bombsight to an "automatic steering device" in response to requests from aircraft commanders aboard the Battle Fleet. BuAer did not have in mind an SBAE or an autopilot, but was only reporting what pilots found obvious-the Mark XI was too complex to allow the pilot to maintain a precise bombing run. Nothing came of the request, however, because BuOrd was busy per- fecting the new Mark XV bombsight and testing the Sperry autopilot-as separate items.
