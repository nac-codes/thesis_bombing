Experimental Engineering Section memo, September 15, 1941, File 202.2-35, HRA. The Dahlgren Proving Ground asked for the suspension of all SBAE production until prob- lems with Norden's bombing system were corrected, but BuOrd overruled it on the grounds that no other alternative was available.

Materiel Center to BuAer, January 6, 1940, Contract Section, Materiel Center to Pioneer Instrument Division, March 4, 1940, and Air Materiel Command memo, November 21, 1943, File 452.19, Folder-Pilot Automatic Type A-5, Box 2243, RD-2626, RG342. The Sperry Gyroscope Company began the A-5 project in March 1940, completing an experimen- tal model in February 1941. Refinements took another year, but developers were unable to tie the A-5 to the Norden bombsight. It would not replace the Norden SBAE, though the Air Materiel Command attached the A-5 as an AFCE to the Sperry S-1 bombsight for use in B-24 Liberator bombers. AC Spark Plug and Autolite of Toledo, Ohio, produced the A-5 during the war. 39. BuAer to NAF, December 20, 1940, and NAF to BuAer, January 9, 1941, File F41-8.
