sion changed the designations to B-1 for the 12-volt Minneapolis-Honeywell AFCE and C- 1 for the 24-volt Minneapolis-Honeywell AFCE.

In operation the bombsight stabilizer and vertical flight gyroscope of the autopilot detected deviations from straight and level flight. The directional panel of the autopilot mea- sured and seven vacuum tubes amplified these deviations electrically and sent them to servo- motors located near the control surfaces. Power came from a rotary inverter, which generated alternating current for the amplifier from the direct current of the aircraft power supply. The three 23-pound servomotors operated from the 24-volt direct current of the aircraft's power supply. In operation the bombardier turned the bombsight course knobs to control the auto- pilot. The pilot also had a control panel and a formation stick ("pilot's controller") for flying through the power-assisted autopilot system. This latter device was similar to the "high-tech" joystick controls of modern aircraft.
