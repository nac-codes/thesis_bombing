The Air Corps wanted the switch from direct current to alternating current because AC did not require complex and costly commutators and transformers and because it was easier to switch AC to DC using a rectifier than to switch from DC to AC. 48.

The Navy admitted later that the attachments were possible "without interfer- ence with bombsight deliveries." 49. Bell Telephone Laboratories and the National Defense Research Committee com- pleted a Universal Sight in February 1945, capable of both optical and radar bombsighting. Only an experimental device, the Universal Sight, consisting of a Norden bombsight com- bi
