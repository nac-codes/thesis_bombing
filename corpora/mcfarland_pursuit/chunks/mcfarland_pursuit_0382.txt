rch Committee com- pleted a Universal Sight in February 1945, capable of both optical and radar bombsighting. Only an experimental device, the Universal Sight, consisting of a Norden bombsight com- bined with an AN/APQ-31 radar unit, required years of research and development after the war before it reached the production stage.

Simple adjustments to the Norden bombsight allowed it to be used at low altitudes, but lowering its minimum altitude by 200 feet also caused the sight to lose 1,000 feet from its maximum altitude, making the LABA necessary. 52. Brown, "Navy's Mark 15 (Norden) Bombsight," 151-68. At 1,800 feet, Navy crews missed their targets by an average 250 feet sighting through the Norden bombsight with the LABA, but only 150 feet through the bombsight without the LABA. 53.
