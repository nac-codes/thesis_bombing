omb- sights, Box 2323, RD-2644. 25. Loyd Searle ("The Bombsight Wa t War: Norden vs. Sperry") has suggested the S-1 was superior to the Norden and that the decision to cancel the S-1 was the result of a conspiracy. The entire Army Air Forces, not just a Board of Officers, assembled a truly impressive amount of data proving the opposite. The S-1 used a circle aiming point in its optics rather than the cross hairs of the Norden, resulting in a 30 to 40 percent decrease in efficiency and the obscuring of targets at high altitude. Combat crews recorded hundreds of malfunctions with the S-1/A-5 due to voltage problems resulting from crews turning on their radios or turrets. Second Air Force dropped 170,096 practice bombs with the Norden bombsight, achieving an average circular error of 278 feet, compared to 328 feet for the S-1 based on 71,143 bombs. See memo for Perrin, October 25, 1943, and Commanding General Second Air Force to Commanding General Army Air Forces, August 21, 1943, File 452.26, Box 763, Central Decimal Files, Oct. 1942-44, RG18. Eighth Air Force reported that it took 28 man-hours to repair a Norden bombsight and 12 hours for a C-1 autopilot, compared to 34 hours for an S-1 and 14 hours for an A-5 autopilot. See Eighth Air Force Service Command memo, n.d. (1944?), File 519.8724-1, HRA. Brig. Gen. E. S. Perrin, Deputy Chief of Staff, ordered schools to stop training bombardiers in the S-1 in September 1943 because of a general "lack of confidence in the operational value of the Sperry sight."
