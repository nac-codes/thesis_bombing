(April 1944?), File 519.8724-1, HRA. Eighth Air Force's goal was to have sixty- four Norden or Sperry S-1 bombsights per heavy bombardment group, depending on whether the group used B-24s or B-17s. By March 1944 it was 1,351 bombsights above this goal. 29.

The U.S. Navy trained 140 Soviet airmen in the operation of the Norden bombsight at the Elizabeth City, N.C., naval air station beginning in April 1944. In November 1944 an American mission traveled to the Soviet Union to teach a number of engineering officers to maintain the Norden bombsight. The training was part of a $100-million lend-lease program, code-named "Zebra" under Lt. Cdr. Stanley Chernack, to send 188 patrol bombers to the Soviet Union, including 100 Nordens. The Army Air Forces also decided in May 1944 to begin shipping Norden-equipped B-25s to the Soviet Union, although the actual transfer did not begin until late 1944.
