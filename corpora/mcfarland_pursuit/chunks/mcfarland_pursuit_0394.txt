B. In April 1943 the Army Air Forces cut flight training to six weeks for good candidates and eliminated it altogether if the candidate was a washout from any other advanced school. Flying training included instruction in code, physics, math, map reading, aircraft identifica- tion, chemical warfare defe defense, physical education, and formation drill. See AAF Historical Study No. 5, "Individual Training of Bombardiers." 9. TM 1-250 called for 300 bomb releases under a variety of conditions, from altitudes of 1,000 to 20,000 feet. In wartime the need to get as many bombardiers trained as fast as pos- sible cut training to less than 160 bomb releases, none from altitudes above 11,000 feet. In early 1943 a bomb shortage reduced releases to 125. See TM 1-250, October 1944, Folder- Bombing Accuracy Analytical Studies I, Box 76, Subject File, Spaatz Papers. 10.
