The C-1 AFCE allowed a bombardier to take two or three evasive maneuvers during the bomb run, except the last 10 or 15 seconds, but the need to fly in formation prevented such actions. 15. Before the war the Air Corps developed yellow warning and blue drop lights for use by the leader, but they were not used in combat during the war. See 7th Bombardment Group memo, October 2, 1936, File 471.62, Folder-Bombing Methods and Bomb Sight Develop- ment, Box 2891, RD-2884, RG342. In 1943 the Army Air Forces also developed a technique for dropping a group's bombs on signal from the ground. Eureka ground beacons (AN/PPN- 1) signaled the proper release point through Rebecca radio receivers (AN/APN-2) on board 279 che bombers. In testing, circular errors as small as 45 feet became common, though associated roblems prevented field deployment. See AAF Board Project No. (T-5) 35 (H2567), uRebecca-Eureka Bombing," August 9, 1943, File 245.621, HRA. An alternate plan to use the radio equipment of the AZON guided bomb to achieve an automatic release of a forma- son's bombs was subject to enemy jamming and was therefore dropped.

A similar plan to use a ground-based inverted Norden bombsight and tele- scope to spot the correct release point in the sky was also stillborn.
