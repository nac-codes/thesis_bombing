ilar plan to use a ground-based inverted Norden bombsight and tele- scope to spot the correct release point in the sky was also stillborn.

On B-17s the salvo switch was mounted on the bombar- dier's control panel, allowing easy access. On some B-24s the salvo switch was on a separate panel behind the bombardier. When even a second's delay could cause a bombing error of several hundred feet, such a problem increased inaccuracy. This factor alone could explain why B-17s were more accurate than B-24s during the war. In 1944 the average percent within 1,000 feet for B-17 groups was 36.3, but only 27.5 for B-24 groups. See "AAF Bombing Accuracy," July 1944-45, Report No. 2, File 134.71-83, HRA. The USSBS concluded that the B-17 was a more efficient combat aircraft because it was more accurate, more durable, few higher, and had more defensive machine guns.
