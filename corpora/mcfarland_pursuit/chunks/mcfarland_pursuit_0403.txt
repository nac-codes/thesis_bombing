The Eighth Air Force Operational Research Section reasoned the intervalometer scattered "bombs so widely that the number of bombs hitting the target is serious dimin- ished." From 22,000 feet using a 50-foot intervalometer setting meant a "decrease in number of hits by ratio of 137 to 100, but a gain in efficiency from 75% with Salvo to 85 or 90% with intervalometer. The loss is much greater than the gain." See Eighth Air Force Operational Research Section, "Memorandum on Salvo and Intervalometer Releases," September 16, 1944, File 520.547B, HRA. Fifteenth Air Force preferred the intervalometer release over the salvo release.  Notes to Pages 173-180 280 Notes to Pages 180-182 21.
