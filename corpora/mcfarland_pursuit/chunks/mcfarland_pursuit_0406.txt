nd "Introduction to Micro-H Bombing for Aircrews," August 29, 1944, File 168.6005-73C, HRA. At the end of the war the Army Air Forces de- oloved the SHORAN (short-range navigation) system, like Gee-H, but providing continuous " formation to the pilot direction indicator to allow the operator to concentrate on synchro- mizing rate. Shoran did not use the Norden bombsight, but a separate computer utilizing the radar's rate and altitude information to determine the bomb release point. 37. An executive order of June 29, 1941, established the Office of Scientific Research and Development to assure "adequate provision for research on scientific and medical problems relating to the national defense." Within the OSRD the NDRC recommended contracts with universities, research institutions, and industrial laboratories for research and development on instrumentalities of warfare." Division 14 dealt with radar. See U.S. National Archives, Federal Records of World War II (Washington, D.C .: Government Printing Office, 1950), 207- 0. 212-15. The Navy pursued a radar bombsight through Carl L. Norden, Inc. Bell Tele- phone Laboratories informed BuOrd of its progress on radar research in December 1941. BuOrd contacted Norden and brought the two companies together on May 11, 1942. BuOrd won commitments from Norden to design the stabilizer and bombing computer and from Bell Telephone Laboratories to design a three-centimeter radar system, capable of bombing from 250 feet up to 30,000 feet. See BuOrd to Naval Inspector of Ordnance (Norden), De- cember 18, 1941, and Minutes of Conference, May 14, 1942, File F41-8, Vol. 6, Box 711, BuAer Confidential Correspondence, 1922-44, RG72. 38.

The Italy-based Fifteenth Air Force called it "synchronous bombing" or "PFF- synchronous bombing." PFF stood for pathfinder force. See 1st Operations Analysis Section
