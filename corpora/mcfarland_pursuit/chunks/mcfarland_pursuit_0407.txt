g "H2X with visual assis- tance." The Italy-based Fifteenth Air Force called it "synchronous bombing" or "PFF- synchronous bombing." PFF stood for pathfinder force.

In radar bombing training the Army Air Forces developed a unique use for the Norden bombsight. Wright Field modi- fied an SCR-584 antiaircraft gun fire control radar to track the training aircraft. The radar determined the aircraft's position and transferred information on heading, altitude, and speed to a Norden bombsight mounted to project a light beam onto a map. A radio link determined the point of bomb release. 41. School of Applied Tactics, "Radar Bombing," 1942-45, File 248.231-140, and "Bomb- ing Errors," n.d., File 248.222-47, HRA. 42.
