Ironically Wright Field developed the NOSMEAGLE system not for improved accuracy, but because dramatically increased trail values resulting from the antici-  282 Notes to Pages 183-186 Notes to Pages 186-188 pated higher speeds of jet aircraft were beyond the capabilities of the Norden bombsight. Higher speeds meant bomb runs of shorter duration, limiting the usefulness of visual observa- tion. See Armament Laboratory to Engineering Division, May 1, 1944, and June 21, 1944, File 202.2-35, HRA. The Eagle's accuracy was based on a 16-foot antenna hung in an 18- foot airfoil beneath the aircraft.
