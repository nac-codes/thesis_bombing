nuscule angle that would be amplified to an error of several hundred feet on the ground. See Thomas and Witts, Enola Gay, 68-69. Additionally, Harvard University researchers discovered close to the end of the war that each bombardier's lens, pupils, and retinal images differed when focusing on objects at various distances-a problem magnified by the bombsight telescope. Such factors only multiplied inherent bombing inaccuracies. See Boyce, New Weapons for Air Warfare, 85. 52.

See, for example, Allen Raymond, "How Our Bombsight Solves Problems," Popular Science 143 (December 1943): 116-19, 212, 214, who notes the "technical miracle of precision 283 bombing . .. the bomb, which started out as a monster of terror and destruction, is to become an instrument of mercy, like a surgeon's scalpel." 54. Greenfield, American Strategy in World War II, 120-21. At peak strength, the American strategic forces arrayed against Germany included 7,177 heavy bombers, supported by 619,020 personnel. See USSBS, Overall Report (European War), Table 1. 35. The Air Corps Tactical School faculty wrote just before the war that "we believe-if 127 bombs must be dropped to get one in an area bigger than a baseball diamond-it may be better to employ bombardment to augment the artillery than against small vital objec- iges."

USSBS, "Daylight Bombing Accuracy of the 8th, 9th and 15th Air Forces," August 24. 1945, File 137.306-6, HRA. The average circular error for different bombs in Europe was 2,694 feet (100-pound bomb), 2,978 feet (250-pound bomb), 1,673 feet (500-pound homb), 1,308 feet (1,000-pound bomb), and 571 feet (2,000-pound bomb).
