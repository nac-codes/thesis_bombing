Fuller, The Second World War, 1939- 1945 (New York: Duell, Sloan, and Pearce, 1949), 231, claimed "the strategic bombing of Germany up to the spring of 1944 was an extravagant failure.

The USSBS claimed bombing caused "defeatism, fear, hopelessness, fatal- ism, and apathy." These were the products of the bombing: 305,000 dead, 780,000 wounded, 1.865 million homes destroyed, the forced evacuation of 4.885 million, and the deprivation of utilities to 20 million Germans.
