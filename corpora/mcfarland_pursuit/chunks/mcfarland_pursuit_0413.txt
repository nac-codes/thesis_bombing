ed evacuation of 4.885 million, and the deprivation of utilities to 20 million Germans. The Federal Statistical Office in Wiesbaden, Germany, claimed that bombing killed 593,000 German civilians and destroyed 3.37 million dwellings. See Hastings, Bomber Command, 352. 69. There are some who argue strategic bombing did win the war. Immediately after the war, Bernard Brodie argued that strategic bombing knocked the German war economy "flat on its back," though too late to affect the outcome on the battlefield. See Bernard Brodie, "Strategic Bombing: What It Can Do," Reporter, August 15, 1950, 28-31. In a 1988 book, Alfred C. Mierzejewski argued that the Army Air Forces's campaign against the German transportation network after the summer of 1944 effectively destroyed the German industrial war effort by interdicting the critical choke-point in the German economy-coal. He docu- mented the surplus capacity in that economy in defense of the length of time required for the collapse. The collapse did not come until the last six months of the war, however, by which time Allied armies were inside Germany's borders. Additionally, Mierzejewski saw war as a strictly economic issue-stop the shipment of coal and you destroy the economy and defeat Germany. Despite this collapse, the German military fought on. The synthetic oil industry produced fuel almost exclusively for the military. The oil campaign therefore struck primarily against the armed forces and led more directly to the defeat of the German military. Germany would be defeated only when Allied ground armies occupied its territory. See Mierzejewski, The Collapse of the German War Economy. 70.

The most telling data supporting the conclusion that several more months of bombing would have destroyed the German industrial capability to wage war comes from the Strategic Bombing Survey.
