ork: McGraw-Hill, 1982). In 1943 the Army Air Forces Board carried out extensive studies of the capabilities of the Norden bombsight in B-17s from various altitudes. Against a small boat at rest the circular error was between 80 and 180 feet. Against a maneuvering boat, 1,119 bombs achieved a circular error of 646 feet and a 3 percent hit rate from 20,000 feet.
