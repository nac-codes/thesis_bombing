of his works are also surprising in both their superficiality and their paucity in number. Most amazing of all, although Douhet wrote prodigiously, very few of his works have been translated from his native Italian. His prewar writings, war diaries, and numerous articles and novels composed in the 1920s are unknown in English. Indeed, fully one-half of the first edition of his seminal The Command of the Air  remains untranslated and virtually forgotten. Nonetheless, the available writings clearly place Douhet in the top rank of air theorists. He was one of the first to think and write seriously and systematically about the air weapon and the effect it would have on warfare. Like the other early airmen, he was profoundly influenced by the carnage of World War I. Douhet was a believer in the future of airpower even before the war, and his experiences during the Great War and the horrendous casualties suffered by the Italian army on the Austrian front hardened his views even further. His basic precepts—that the air would become a violent and crucial xiii  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 12 --- battlefield; that the country controlling the air would also control the surface; that aircraft, by virtue of their ability to operate in the third dimension, would carry war to all peoples in all places; and that the psychological effects of air bombardment would be great—have proven accurate. Unfortunately, however, he also had a distressing tendency to exaggerate the capabilities of airpower—an endemic affliction among air theorists. He grossly overestimated the physical and psychological effectiveness that bombing would have on civilian populations. Douhet’s hyperbole should not, however, allow us to ignore his very real contributions to the early development of airpower theory. Another of the early thinkers who had a similarly great impact on the evolution of the air weapon was Hugh Trenchard. Widely recognized as the father of the Royal Air Force (RAF), Trenchar
