wer theory. Another of the early thinkers who had a similarly great impact on the evolution of the air weapon was Hugh Trenchard. Widely recognized as the father of the Royal Air Force (RAF), Trenchard was both more practical and less inclined to exaggerate claims for the air weapon than was his Italian counterpart. As commander of the British air arm in war and peace, he was responsible not only for imparting a vision for the use and future of the air weapon, but also for carrying out the sobering task of organizing, equipping, training, and leading a combat organization on a day-to-day basis. Initially not a strong advocate of strategic airpower, Trenchard soon became a passionate proponent. Specifically, he was convinced that air bombardment of a country’s industrial infrastructure would have a devastating and decisive psychological effect on the morale of the civilian population. His emphasis on morale, regrettably, was often misunderstood as a brief for population bombing. Unlike Douhet, Trenchard never advocated such an air strategy. A major reason for this misunderstanding was an unwilling- ness or an inability to fully articulate his ideas on airpower. One can count the number of Trenchard’s published writings, none longer than 10 or so pages, on the fingers of one hand. Added to this were his notoriously poor speaking skills; seemingly, he was not a very good communicator—although it must be said that the RAF certainly seemed to divine his drift. Thus, attempting to reconstruct his views on air warfare is not an easy task. Indeed, to write a history of RAF thought between the world  wars, one must mine the fairly modest collection of xiv  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 13 --- essays written by serving RAF officers (mostly junior) that were published in the occasional book or in the pages of the RAF Quarterly  and RUSI [Royal United Services Institute] Journal . No individuals dominate this field, with the possible exception of John Slessor. But
