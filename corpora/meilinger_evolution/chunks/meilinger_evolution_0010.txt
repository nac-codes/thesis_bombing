in the occasional book or in the pages of the RAF Quarterly  and RUSI [Royal United Services Institute] Journal . No individuals dominate this field, with the possible exception of John Slessor. But even his intellectual reputation is based largely on, first, his book Air Power and Armies,  that contains a collection of his lectures at the British Army Staff College in the early 1930s, and, second, his later fame as a marshal of the RAF and the relatively prolific (for an airman) literary legacy that he accumulated after retirement. One should also note that there is no history of the RAF Staff College—what Trenchard called “the cradle of our brain,” where airpower doctrine was formulated and promulgated between the wars. Moreover, there is not even a complete collection of Staff College lectures extant that can give us a definite picture of what was taught there. Excavating the intellectual foundations of the US Army Air Corps can also be a challenge. We certainly have available the extensive writings of Billy Mitchell, who published five books, dozens of articles, and scores of newspaper op-ed pieces. Unquestionably, Mitchell dominated the early years of the American air arm just as Trenchard did the RAF. Like his British counterpart, this influence was due not simply to his administrative position but also to his ability to impart a vision of airpower to an eager group of subordinates.

Unfortunately, Mitchell’s writings become almost embarrassingly repetitious after 1925 or so. Moreover, his inordinate and near-neurotic hatred of the Navy distorted much of his writing, confused his message, and left a legacy of animosi
