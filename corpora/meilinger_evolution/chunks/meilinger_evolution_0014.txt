War II broke out, the French air force was hopelessly outclassed by the Luftwaffe. Moreover, French doctrine, which emphasized the primacy of defensive air operations, made the air arm almost an irrelevancy. One finds a different story in the Soviet Union. When the Russian Empire collapsed in 1917, the country’s air arm was weak and outmoded. For the next few years, this downward trend continued but began to change in the mid-1920s, when revolutionaries started rebuilding their military forces. Mikhail Tukhachevski, army chief of staff, articulated the concept of “deep battle” that was to dominate Soviet military thinking for the next several decades. Airpower played a major role in this type of warfare, mainly via interdiction of enemy troops and supplies. The predilection for tactical airpower was reinforced by the Soviets’ close relationship between the wars with the German military, which also emphasized tactical over strategic airpower. Although the Soviets did not neglect bombardment doctrine or the development of bomber aircraft, by the outbreak of war, the Soviet air force had a distinctly tactical focus. The rise of the Luftwaffe from the ashes of defeat makes for a remarkable tale. Field Marshal Hans von Seeckt was the intellectual progenitor of what would soon be called blitzkrieg. In this type of war, reminiscent of the ideas then being espoused by Tukhachevski, airpower was of great importance. More so than in any other country, the actions of the ground and air arms were closely linked—doctrinally and organizationally. The experience of the Spanish Civil War bolstered these beliefs. As a result, although the Luftwaffe flirted with the idea of strategic bombing in the 1930s, for a variety of reasons, the Germans never built a long-range air force. It is certainly debatable whether or not that was a wise decision. In any event, Germany, prostrate in 1919, had the strongest and most capable air arm in the world 20 years later.
