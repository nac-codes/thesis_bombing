rtainly debatable whether or not that was a wise decision. In any event, Germany, prostrate in 1919, had the strongest and most capable air arm in the world 20 years later. The intellectual center of the American air arm during the 1930s was the Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS). A coterie of exceptional individuals at Maxwell Field, Alabama, devised and disseminated the doctrine of high-altitude precision xviii  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 17 --- bombing of an enemy’s industrial centers. This was the “industrial web” concept that the Army Air Forces followed in World War II. Nonetheless, we must not forget that our knowledge of these men and their work is most unusual. First, they published very little at the time: the Air Corps had no professional journal equivalent to the RAF Quarterly . The closest thing to it on this side of the ocean was US Air Services,  an intelligent monthly magazine that dealt with aviation matters in both the military and civilian sectors. It often contained articles by American military airmen, but these were generally short and dealt with technical or tactical matters. Published herein and elsewhere were articles by George Kenney, Ken Walker, Claire Chennault, Hugh Knerr, and others. As in Britain, their names call to us from the pages of the 1930s, not really because of what their articles contained, but because of who they later became. How then do we know in such detail the nature of American airpower thought in the 1930s? Thankfully, we have a remarkable collection of lectures, written and delivered at ACTS, carefully stored away, and often containing appendices, notes, and comments by later lecturers. Most of our knowledge and understanding of American airpower theory is based on these documents—a fact that is both comforting and dangerous. It is comforting because we have a readily accessible, discrete, limited, and authoritative cache of information that, once mastered, gives a remarkably clear view of what went on
