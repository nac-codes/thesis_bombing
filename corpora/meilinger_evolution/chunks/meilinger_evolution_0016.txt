ting and dangerous. It is comforting because we have a readily accessible, discrete, limited, and authoritative cache of information that, once mastered, gives a remarkably clear view of what went on at ACTS. But does that picture reflect thinking throughout the Air Corps as a whole? Therein lies the danger. Generally, historians base their chronicles on the written evidence at hand; if there is no written evidence, there is no history. Because of this rather simple but ironclad rule, we know precious little of what doctrinal innovation was occurring at airfields and operational units around the country. Airmen were too busy “operating” to be encumbered with writing down what they did. Their story, though crucial, is little known and thus overshadowed by that copious, clear, discrete, and “authoritative” cache referred to above. In short, do we give a disproportionate share of emphasis and credit to the thinkers and instructors at ACTS merely because they xix  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 18 --- were the ones who had the time and opportunity to write all the books? Do we really know the extent of their impact on the contemporary Air Corps? Did anyone in the field actually listen to them? There are no such doubts regarding Alexander P. de Seversky (who liked to use his reserve rank of major), a prodigious writer and speaker who had an enormous influence on the American public. De Seversky was perhaps the most effective popularizer of and propagandizer for airpower in history. He wrote three books—one of which, Victory through Air Power,  was a Book of the Month Club selection, reportedly read by five million people and even made into an animated movie by Walt Disney. He also wrote scores of articles for magazines as diverse as Ladies’ Home Journal, Look, Reader’s Digest, Mechanix Illustrated,  and Air University Quarterly Review . Finally, he gave hundreds of radio addresses and wrote hundreds more press releases for the news media. All were devoted to
