leaders, the new theorists wrote of models and logic. Precisely because there was no experience, there was no proof, and no one could say whether the academicians were right or xxi  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 20 --- wrong. These were exercises in Aristotelian logic. Thus, the new thinkers were in much the same position as Douhet, Mitchell, Trenchard, and others several decades earlier—or, for that matter, as the medieval theologians who debated how many angels could dance on the head of a pin. During the decades of the 1950s and 1960s, this new breed dominated strategic thinking. Some people would claim that this domination was most unfortunate for the country, because thinking about conventional warfare—especially conventional air warfare—atrophied. Airmen like Douhet argued that war, though inevitable and total, would be mercifully short and decisive due to airpower. The nuclear theorists offered a more positive future: major war was now so horrible and thus “unthinkable” that it might no longer occur. Unfortunately, it did. As a result, this new breed planned and articulated, to a great extent, the strategy (or nonstrategy) of Vietnam. Military leaders, having lost their preeminence in the realm of military strategy, largely through their own intellectual lethargy, now received schemes designed by “whiz kids” and had to implement them. By necessity, airmen in the United States were forced to grapple, however tentatively, with the issue of the role of airpower in what was euphemistically referred to as low intensity conflict (LIC). LIC is not a subject most airmen readily discuss. Indeed, most military officers prefer not to treat with the subject. LIC is a nasty and brutish affair, not conducive to the gaining of either glory or military force structure. A standard response of military leaders is to assume away the problems involved in this type of warfare, believing that preparation for general war will ensure automatic coverage of “lesser” form
