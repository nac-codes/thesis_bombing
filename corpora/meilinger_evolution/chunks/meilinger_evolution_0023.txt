enemy leadership. This in turn would lead to paralyzing indecision and inaction. Although many critics have disagreed with Warden’s theories, his book’s xxiv  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 23 --- importance lies in the fact that it is one of the very few works about airpower theory written by a serving American officer since World War II. More importantly, Warden would eventually end up at the Pentagon as the deputy director for war-fighting concepts development, a position he held when Saddam Hussein decided to move south. His superiors then gave him the opportunity to translate his theories into a workable air campaign plan that served as the blueprint for the air war against Iraq. In some ways Warden was responding to a tendency he saw developing in the Air Force since the end of the Vietnam War: the increasing emphasis placed on tactical air operations. Institutionally, the US Army and the US Air Force emerged from Vietnam with much closer ties to each other than had existed before the war. As the senior leadership in the Air Force slowly changed from officers with bomber backgrounds to those with fighter backgrounds—the men who had borne the brunt of air combat in the Vietnam War—this closeness increased, especially in the sphere of doctrine. Significantly, because the Army has always taken the subjects of theory and doctrine most seriously, and because it formed a Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) in 1973, the Army took the lead in evolving new concepts and methods of achieving air-ground cooperation. 6 A strengthening of Warsaw Pact forces in the Central Region in Europe spurred this move. Outnumbered North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces needed to maximize the efficiency and punch of their combat units. The initial Army response, partly induced by the trauma still lingering from Vietnam, entailed an emphasis on defensive operations. But by the early 1980s, this posture was already moving towards a far greater concentration on th
