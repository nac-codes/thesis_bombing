s traditionally more stormy relationship with its naval counterparts. Personalities have been crucial in both instances. A particular and unique strain of airpower theory evolved in Europe as a result of NATO. The mission of the alliance was to keep the peace in Europe. However, the peculiar demands of each member nation ensured that military strategy was dominated by political imperatives to an unusually high degree. For example, in order to project the image that NATO was purely defensive, military planners were not allowed to plan for offensive operations outside alliance territory. If Warsaw Pact forces attacked, they would merely be driven back. NATO had no intention of liberating even East Germany, much less Eastern Europe. In addition, the requirement that military decisions, doctrine, and policy have unanimity among all the member nations put a high premium on compromise and consensus building. Analysts recognized early in the 1950s that NATO could never match the size of the Warsaw Pact forces opposing them. In geographic terms, this translated into a realization that West Germany—and perhaps the low countries as well—would be difficult to hold in the event of Soviet attack. To counter this deficiency, NATO relied on several factors: xxvi  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 25 --- technological superiority, nuclear weapons, energetic commitment to maneuver warfare, and airpower. In truth, all of these factors were directly related to airpower. This realization led to a number of doctrinal initiatives that stressed, among other things, centralized command and control of air assets. It also led to a long and spirited debate between and within member nations regarding the relative importance of strategic air attacks, air interdiction, and close air support. The nations attained consensus, but it took many years— and it carried a price. In order to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of NATO airpower, nations have had to specialize in those areas
