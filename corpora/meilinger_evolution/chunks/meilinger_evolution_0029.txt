and verifiable answer will be forthcoming to the question, Whither space? Theory and doctrine are not subjects that airmen readily take to. As Carl Builder has noted, airmen tend to be doers, not thinkers. 7 That is not a healthy trait. Unfortunately, the most recent major conflict has not helped the situation. In the Persian Gulf War, the abundance of available airpower allowed us to use it redundantly and even inefficiently in order to avoid irritating service and allied sensitivities. Doctrinal and theoretical differences were therefore papered over. But force drawdowns may not permit inefficiencies and doctrinal vagueness in future conflicts. The double bind for the future is that interservice rivalry will heighten as a result of budget cuts at precisely the time decreased forces and capabilities make any such rivalry unacceptably dangerous. Key issues such as command and control, theater air defense, the joint use of strategic tanker aircraft, the employment concepts of attack helicopters, the effectiveness of land-based versus sea-based airpower, the emerging field of information warfare, the organizational structure for employing space assets, and a host of other such issues must be addressed and resolved. Moreover, this must be done in peacetime; when a crisis xxix  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 28 --- erupts, it is too late to begin thinking through basic premises. It is the hope of the contributors, all associated with the School of Advanced Airpower Studies—the descendant of the Air Corps Tactical School—that this book will serve as a primer and an analytical treatment of airpower theory for fellow students of modern war.
