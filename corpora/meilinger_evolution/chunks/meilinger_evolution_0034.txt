or for that matter, the formation of independent air units.” Further, the major called on Italian industry to embrace the new invention and to develop its potential for both commerce and national security. The relationship between the civilian aircraft industry and the strength of a country’s military defense was an important subject, one to which he would later return. Finally, when discussing the types of aircraft the air force should have, Douhet  suggested that a “general purpose type of aircraft” be developed that could fulfill the roles of reconnaissance , air combat, and bombardment. 7 Significantly, this aircraft should be capable of carrying a heavy load of bombs. Overall, this report left interesting clues about the direction Douhet ’s ideas on airpower would soon take. Also in 1912, Douhet  assumed command of the Italian aviation battalion at Turin and soon wrote “Rules for the UseMEILINGER 3  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 32 --- of Airplanes in War,” one of the first such manuals in any air force. Interestingly, however, his superiors made him delete all passages referring to the airplane as a “weapon”; to them it was merely a “device” to support the surface forces—nothing more. 8 Douhet ’s incessant preaching on such matters irked his superiors, and he soon became known as a “radical.” Moreover, in early 1914 he ordered, without authorization, the construction of several Caproni bombers . In truth, Douhet had tried to go through proper channels, but his superior, Colonel Moris —who was still enamored with the dirigible — dragged his feet. Characteristically, Douhet  became impatient and took matters into his own hands. Such presumption, coupled with a personality variously described as dogmatic, assertive, persistent, impatient, tactless, and supremely self-confident, earned him exile to the infantry. 9 Unfortunately, Douhet ’s methods for advancing the cause of airpower tended to work at cross-purposes to his goals. Douhet  was serving as
