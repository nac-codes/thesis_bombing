Unfortunately, few of his many works have been translated into English. Indeed, fully one-half of the first edition of The Command of the Air , comprising a lengthy appendix discussing the principles of flight and technical details of aircraft and seaplane construction, has never been translated and remains largely forgotten. 22 Giulio Douhet  died of a heart attack on 15 February 1930, while tending his garden at Ceschina, near Rome.

What made the attritional war  of 1914–18 more horrifying was advancing technology —specifically the machine gun— that gave an overwhelming advantage to the defender. Defense behind
