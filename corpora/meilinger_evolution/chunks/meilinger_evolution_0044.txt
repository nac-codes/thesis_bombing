—their armies were still largely intact in the fall of 1918, but the will of these nations to continue the fight had dissolved. In Douhet ’s view, airpower could break a people’s will by destroying or neutralizing a country’s “vital centers ”— those elements of society, government, military, and industrial structure essential to the functioning of the state. Because of their value—as well as their immobility and vulnerability— these centers  were protected by fortresses and armies. It was therefore necessary to defeat these armies and reduce these fortresses to expose the soft, inner core. Once disarmed, a country would then usually surrender rather than suffer the humiliation of an enemy occupation. Over time, many people began to equate destruction of the army with the objective of war, rather than merely as a means to an end. The Great War demonstrated that such a goal could have catastrophic consequences. Douhet  reminded his readers that the true objective in war was the enemy’s will , and only aircraft could strike it directly, overflying and ignoring the surface conflict below. In short, aircraft could obviate the bloody first step of destroying the enemy army, which now became superfluous. Douhet  was perhaps the first person to realize that the key to airpower was targeting , because although aircraft could strike virtually anything, they should not attempt to strike everything. One had to identify the most important objectives and hit them most forcefully. Choosing the proper targets would not be an easy task and would require great insight; in this area, air commanders would prove their ability. Because the choice of targets would depend on a number of circumstances— economic, military, political, and psychological—it would be variable. But Douhet identified five basic target systems as the vital centers of a modern country: industry, transportation infrastructure, communication nodes, government buildings, and the will  of the people. 27 To Douhet , thi
