five basic target systems as the vital centers of a modern country: industry, transportation infrastructure, communication nodes, government buildings, and the will  of the people. 27 To Douhet , this last category was the most important, because the total wars of the new industrialized age were no longer a contest between armed foes: all people wereMEILINGER 11  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 40 --- combatants—women and men alike—and their collective will would have to be broken. Douhet  bluntly stated that one could do this most effectively by urban bombing , which would terrorize the population. But that is precisely why it would have such great effect: “Normal life could not be carried on in this constant nightmare of imminent death and destruction.” 28 In “The War of 19—,” which described a fictional war between Germany  and a French-Belgian alliance, Douhet  had German bombers striking cities immediately after the outbreak of war to make a “moral impression” on the population. 29 Significantly, Douhet  implied that one might not need such terror bombing  because gaining command of the air would be so psychologically devastating that destruction of vital centers would be unnecessary. The side that lost control of its own airspace would realize what was in store and surrender rather than face devastation. Thus, war would become so horrible it would be humanizing, a paradox which generated in Douhet  a strange ambivalence about the righteousness of airpower that he never fully resolved. Also of interest is his emphasis on the importance of gaining command of the air, which implied that this effort was comparable to clashes between opposing armies, wherein a decisive battle meant victory in the war: “Once a nation has been conquered in the air it may be subjected to such moral torture that it would be obliged to cry ‘Enough’ before  the war could be decided upon the surface” (emphasis in original).30 In other words, he came close to identifying the en
