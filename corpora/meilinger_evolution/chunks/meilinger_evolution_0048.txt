his ideas, Douhet  called for an independent air force (IAF) . Airpower divorced from army and navy control was essential because it could not be the “Cinderella of the family,” dependent on the generosity of older sisters, 35 but must see to its own needs. Even the most conservative soldier and sailor recognized how essential aircraft had become to their operations. Although denying that airpower could be a decisive factor in war, they realized that victory was unlikely without it. To Douhet , this realization was dangerous if it meant that surface commanders could demand airpower, under their control, to support tactical operations. In this circumstance, the aviation defense budget  would suffer a fatal split between independent and auxiliary airpower —a situation that would help no one. The IAF would consist largely of “bombardment units” and “combat units,” the former comprising long-range, heavy- load-carrying aircraft of moderate speed. Although Douhet considered interception of a bomber  force unlikely, he admitted the possibility of such an eventuality and therefore called for “combat units” or escort aircraft . With approximately the same performance characteristics as the bombers , these escorts  would carry machine guns to ward off enemy interceptors. Notably, because he did not anticipate the actual occurrence of an air battle , he claimed that one would not really require such defensive armaments, but he included them as a comfort to aircrew morale. 36 The only other aircraft Douhet  thought necessary was a fast, long-range reconnaissance  plane to fly over enemy territory, photographing potential targets. One needed reconnaissance  for effective targeting , not only to pinpoint objectives but also to determine the effectiveness of air attacks on those objectives. In the revised edition of The Command of the Air , Douhet  combined the functions of bombardment and escort into one aircraft—the battle plane , which he envisioned flying en masse towards an
