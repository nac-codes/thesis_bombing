effective at “first strike” or preventive war. If mobilization were not a factor in air warfare and if air defense were impossible, then obviously the country that struck first would enjoy an enormous, almost insurmountable, advantage. Assuming Douhet ’s formulation, therefore, in times of crisis one would tend to use the air weapon precipitously. Thus—even more so than in the era before the Great War , when mobilization was tantamount to a declaration of war—the inexorable, almost inevitable, nature of air attack might mean that the slightest twitch in times of crisis could lead to catastrophe. The air weapon, by its nature, sported a hair trigger. Douhet  recognized that the strength of a country’s air force was integrally related to the condition of its civil aviation industry; indeed, he viewed military air as even more dependent on the civil sector than either land  or sea power . Douhet  saw a strong and symbiotic relationship among an air force, the aviation industry , the government, and a country’s commercial vitality. 39 He argued that the government must subsidize and support civil aviation in three general ways. First, it should establish air routes consisting of airports, emergency landing fields, radio and signal beacons, and weather stations. Second, it must fund research and development —aircraft and their special high-performance engines were too expensive to expect industry to assume the financial burden for their development. Third, Douhet  believed that civil airliners should be capable of performing military missions. He envisioned airliners with the same specifications as battle planes —and thus able to augment the air force in war. 40THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 16  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 45 --- This idea has some validity. Although complete commonality has not been possible, the technological relationship between civil  and military aircraft  has always been close because scientific advances often benefit both sectors.
