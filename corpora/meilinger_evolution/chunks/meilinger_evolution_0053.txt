warfare was even worse than he—or anyone else—had imagined. The few and fairly weak attempts at strategic bombing seemed to provide disproportionately large results. Douhet  therefore expanded upon his earlier ideas, threw in a few examples from the war, and produced the first edition of The Command of the Air in 1921. The response to his work was fairly muted. Perhaps because of Europe’s inevitable revulsion to war in the wake of the armistice  or because of the great turmoil occasioned byMEILINGER 17  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 46 --- the rise of Mussolini  and the Fascist state, Douhet ’s book caused little stir initially. During the six years after the publication of his book, the “second theorist” continued to think and write, out of the public eye, and in the process his radicalism grew. The result was the second edition of The Command of the Air , which, as we have seen, was more extreme than the first. The revised work reduced the role of the army and navy but increased the importance of strategic airpower . As a consequence, the utility of auxiliary aviation became nil. Finally, Douhet  placed even greater faith in the ability of the bomber  to penetrate enemy airspace and destroy targets. Escorts  were unnecessary. Unlike the first edition, the 1927 version of The Command of the Air had a noisy reception. The third Douhet  spent the last three years of his life reacting to the firestorm created by his revised work. Because of his reputation and personality, as well as the primitive state of aviation even into the mid-1920s, ignoring Douhet  had been easy. Clearly, his superiors—even those involved with aviation or sympathetic to it—had not taken him too seriously. As a consequence, his writings up to 1927 had generated little debate within his profession. After that date, however, such was not the case. Mussolini  clearly approved of airpower; new airmen like Italo Balbo  were becoming national heroes and gaining international reputations;
