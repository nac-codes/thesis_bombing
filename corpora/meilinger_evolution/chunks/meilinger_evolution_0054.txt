profession. After that date, however, such was not the case. Mussolini  clearly approved of airpower; new airmen like Italo Balbo  were becoming national heroes and gaining international reputations; and the aircraft themselves were becoming increasingly capable. The ideas of Douhet  thus posed a threat to the proponents of land  and sea power , whom he was constantly attacking. Not used to defending himself from incessant and virulent attack, Douhet  for the first time had to engage in an intelligent, albeit heated, debate with his military peers. Nonetheless, given the gusto with which he responded to his critics between 1927 and 1930, largely through the pages of Rivista Aeronautica,  he certainly seemed to enjoy the controversy. What effect did this long overdue dialogue have on his theories? The impact was mixed. On the one hand, it forced him to clearly define terms like command of the air,  and this clarification enhanced his theory. 41 On the other hand, however, it drove him to dig in his heels even more adamantly regarding the dominance of airpower over surface warfare .THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 18  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 47 --- The increased radicalization of Douhet ’s ideas, spurred by the heated debate in professional military journals, culminated in his last work, “The War of 19—,” written in the last months of his life but not published until soon after his death. In many ways, this piece combined and magnified Douhet ’s most extreme positions. The entire war lasts less than two days, and dozens of major cities lie in ashes. The battle planes of the victorious Germans suffer enormous losses, but succeeding waves continue and are unstoppable. The morale of the civilian population quickly collapses, and the political leadership sues for peace, while the land forces of the belligerents have barely even begun their mobilization and assembly. The war of the future is therefore rapid, violent, relatively bloodless (compared to the Great War )
