racy, as in Panama , then ground forces will dominate. But in other instances, such as the Persian Gulf War , airpower is dominant. In terms of this meaning, Douhet believed passionately that airpower could be decisive  in war and thus revolutionary. He did, however, stumble in several key respects. One of Douhet ’s more glaring errors was his overestimation of the psychological effects of bombing . He believed that people would panic in the face of a determined air attack . To a great extent, however, one can excuse Douhet  for this mistake since he had little empirical evidence to draw upon—and the available evidence was quite supportive. For example, in 1925 military theorist Basil H. Liddell Hart commented on the psychological effect of German bombing attacks on Britain  in World War I : Witnesses of the earlier air attacks before our defence was organized, will not be disposed to underestimate the panic and disturbance that would result from a concentrated blow dealt by a superior air fleet. Who that saw it will ever forget the nightly sight of the population of a great industrial and shipping town, such as Hull, streaming out into the fields on the first sound of the alarm signals? Women, children, babies in arms, spending night after night huddled in sodden fields, shivering under a bitter winter sky. 42 Douhet  had read of such panic during the war and noted it in his diaries. Clearly, these reports made a deep impression on him. In truth, one could find many such descriptions in the literature of the time, and even Stanley Baldwin, former British prime minister, proclaimed glumly in 1932 that “the bomber  would always get through.” 43 People clearly believed such warnings: during the Munich crisis of 1938, fully one-third of the population of Paris evacuated the city to avoid a possible German air assault .44 The problem with such apocalyptic predictions was that they failed to address whether morale  was even a relevant issue in a tightly organized police
