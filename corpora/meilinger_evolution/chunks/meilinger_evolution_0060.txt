order to achieve optimal bomb dispersion, crews should be trained to “scatter their bombs” in a “uniform fashion.” 51 Nothing more clearly exposes a key flaw in Douhet ’s theories. He was out of touch with the details and showed no understanding of the tactics needed to implement those concepts. Apparently, Douhet  was not an aviator; consequently, he frequently made serious missteps, such as this bizarre comment about scattering bombs uniformly, even in the heat of combat. 52 Moreover, Douhet  had an irritating tendency to exaggerate his prophetic powers. In The Command of the Air , he quotes at length from a piece he published in 1910, in which he predicts the coming dominance of the airplane. However, other pieces he wrote during that same period were far more conservative. As noted above, his official report on the Libyan War was strongly muted, dealing mostly with organizational and technical matters. In addition, in 1910 he published an article titled “The Possibilities of Aerial Navigation” that was similarly unremarkable. Douhet  sang the praises of the airplane, but stopped far short of calling for an independent air arm  or even emphasizing the role of strategic bombing  in future wars. Instead, he stressed the reconnaissance  and tactical aspects of aircraft and their importance in battle.53 Thus, Douhet ’s need to backdate his airpower theories to well before World War I  gives us an interesting insight into his personality. Being an early air theorist  was not enough—he had to be the first. Douhet  was also guilty of virtually ignoring the air battle required to attain command of the air. Because the airplane’s inherent attributes  of speed and range granted it tactical surprise, he believed that one could achieve command of the air without a fight. (In “The War of 19—,” the air battle  lasts a mere three hours.) A tension in war has always existed between the strategies of annihilation  and attrition . The latter definitely characterized land warfare
