German and Japanese war economies were devastated; and although not destroyed, civilian morale  was severely damaged by bombardment. Moreover, advocates maintain that Douhet ’s theories were never given a fair test because the basic tenet of his war-fighting philosophy—hold on the ground while attacking in the air—was never carried out, resulting in a diversion of effort that detracted from the potency of the air offensive . The arguments of these advocates are not credible. Millions of tons of bombs were dropped over a period of six years—a scale far in excess of anything imagined by Douhet —but the results did not fulfill his prophecies. (One should remember, however, that Douhet ’s theories presumed the use of gas bombs . It is impossible to say whether or not their use would have made a significant difference in the results of the air campaigns  waged by Germany , Japan , Britain , and the United States . Nonetheless, it is useful to remember the extreme anxiety, bordering on panic, that occurred in Israel  during the Persian Gulf War , when the Israelis feared that Iraqi ScudTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 30  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 59 --- missiles  had chemical warheads. Who would have thought that a country as inured to warfare and the threat of terrorist attacks as Israel  would react in such a fashion?) A seemingly more reasonable approach maintained that atomic weapons  vindicated Douhet ; after all, an invasion of Japan  proper was unnecessary, and the only battle of the home islands was the one conducted by American B-29s . Atomic weapons  seemed to grant new relevance to Douhet because a handful of bombs could now devastate a country, as he had predicted. 67 Such arguments may be even less credible than the claims that Douhet  did not receive a fair test in World War II . If the only circumstance that makes Douhet relevant is nuclear holocaust, then he is totally irrelevant. Given the limited wars of the postwar era, especially Vietnam , Douhet
