test in World War II . If the only circumstance that makes Douhet relevant is nuclear holocaust, then he is totally irrelevant. Given the limited wars of the postwar era, especially Vietnam , Douhet ’s ideas on airpower seemed best confined to the dustbin of history. This has now changed because the thawing of the cold war  and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact , coupled with the decreased presence of forward-deployed American troops, have put a premium on the ability to project power over great distances. This requirement is a natural characteristic of airpower, and the efficacy of the air weapon was never demonstrated more clearly than in the Persian Gulf War . For decades, airmen described airpower with terms like furious, relentless, overwhelming,  and so forth, but to a great extent those were just words, because the technology  did not exist to make them true. But the air war  in the Gulf  finally lived up to the prophecies of the past seven decades.

Douhet ’s rationale was not based on economic efficiency but military necessity. One could not subdivide war by medium—air, land, and sea. It was a whole, and only
