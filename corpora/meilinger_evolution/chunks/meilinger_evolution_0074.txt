r attaché wrote about The Command of the Air  in Aviation  magazine, and Billy Mitchell  later admitted that he had met with Douhet during a trip to Europe  in 1922. About that same time— perhaps even as a result of that meeting—a translation of exerpts from The Command of the Air  made its way into Air Service  files, and in 1923 a longer translation circulated at Air Service headquarters. One historian claims that Mitchell heavily “borrowed from” this translation, and it in turn formed the basis of early Air Service Tactical School  texts that dealt with strategic bombardment .74 This claim is questionable, but by the mid-1930s, articles discussing Douhet  began to appear in American military publications, and a translation of the second edition of The Command of the Air  circulated around the Air Corps  in 1933. 75 In sum, European and American airmen apparently had become well aware of Douhet ’s writings in the decade prior to World War II . Because many people in many places were attempting to come to grips with the new air weapon, drawing clear lines of influence among them becomes virtuallyMEILINGER 33  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 62 --- impossible. That many of the ideas percolating throughout the various air forces were quite similar to those expounded by the Italian air general does not mean those ideas were based on Douhet . What is clear, however, is that by the end of World War II —and as a result of the massive strategic bombing campaigns conducted throughout—the theories of Douhet were commonplace. This notoriety became even greater in the decade that followed, given the emergence of nuclear weapons delivered by airpower. Although equating Douhet  solely with the destruction of cities and their populations is simplistic and incomplete, his name has nonetheless become synonymous with a particular version of air warfare . Giulio Douhet  has generated intense and partisan debate over the past seven decades. Undoubtedly, he had many things
