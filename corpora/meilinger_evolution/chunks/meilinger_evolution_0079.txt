the largest air forces in the world with more than six thousand aircraft. Its sole mission is toTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 36  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 65 --- support ground operations. Douhet would not have dreamed of diverting so many resources to such a mission. 35. Douhet (Ferrari translation), 229. 36. Douhet envisioned “combat units” flying low over enemy defenses to draw fire so that their positions could be identified and then destroyed. This procedure is similar to that of the “Wild Weasels” in the Persian Gulf War: F-4G aircraft carrying antiradiation missiles flew ostentatiously over Iraqi territory, hoping to attract the attention of ground-defense radars. When the Iraqis turned on these radars to track the Weasels, those aircraft launched missiles that homed on the source of the radar beam. 37. During World War II, some B-17s were modified to carry extra armor and machine guns. These aircraft, YB-40s, were then mixed in with the bomber formations striking Germany. However, these modified battle escorts were too heavy to keep up with the bomber stream after the bomb-release point, so the experiment was discontinued. By contrast, the small size of the air-to-air missiles carried by today’s F-15E—the modern equivalent of the battle plane—allows a potent defensive capability that does not diminish the plane’s offensive punch. 38. Douhet (Fischer translation), 34; and idem (Ferrari translation), 347. 39. This concept is echoed in Secretary of the Air Force Donald B. Rice, An Aerospace Nation (Washington, D.C.: Department of the Air Force, 1990). 40. Civilian aircraft were perhaps most effectively used in the Persian Gulf War as cargo aircraft—an application not envisioned by Douhet. Activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet brought over three hundred commercial airliners under military control, and these aircraft moved over four hundred thousand personnel and 95,000 tons of cargo to the Middle East—repre senting 64 percent of the passengers and 2
