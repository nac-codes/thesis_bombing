Golovine, “Air Strategy,” Royal Air Force Quarterly 7 (April 1936): 169–72. Golovine was a Russian expatriate who had served in World War I. Douhet gave no estimates on the amount of incendiary bombs needed to burn a target. They had not been used extensively during the war, so there was little experience on which to base calculations. Gen Billy Mitchell, in his 1922 manual “Notes on the Multi-Motored Bombardment Group” (page 81), estimated that only 30 tons of gas were required to render an area of one square mile “uninhabitable.” That’s about one-third the amount suggested by Golovine. 50.

Lee Kennett, A History of Strategic Bombing  (New York: Scribner’s, 1982), 55. Kennett states that Douhet’s name does not appear on the lists of licensed Italian pilots through 1918. One should know, however, that when Douhet took command of the Aviation Battalion in 1913, he wa
