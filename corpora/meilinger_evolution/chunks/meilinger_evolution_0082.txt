Kennett states that Douhet’s name does not appear on the lists of licensed Italian pilots through 1918. One should know, however, that when Douhet took command of the Aviation Battalion in 1913, he was already 43 years of age—too old to take on the arduous task of learning to fly the dangerous and flimsy aircraft of the day. On the other hand, Douhet worked closely with Caproni in developing an aircraft stabilization device and an aerial camera, as well as designing a special bomb that was flight-tested in 1912. Although he may not have been a pilot, Douhet understood many of the technical problems of flight.

Faber, for translating this article for me. 54. Besides making it clear in “The War of 19—” that one should not be in the first plane of the first wave, Douhet also tantalizes his readers by referring to 180 “explorer” aircraft in the German air force. These were high-speed pursuit planes whose mission “had not been exactly determined.” They encounter French pursuits during the war but play no significant role. Why were they even mentioned? Douhet (Ferrari translation), 342, 383. 55. Douhet would no doubt have maintained that the Germans bungled the operation by shifting to urban attacks before they had achieved command of the air—a violation of his most cardinal precept. 56.

Although poison gas was not used in World War II, the Italians did employ it against Ethiopian civilians in 1935. In a sense, therefore, Douhet was correct in maintaining that hum
