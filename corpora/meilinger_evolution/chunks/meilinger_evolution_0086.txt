breaking either his will  or his capability to fight. Armies were generally condemned to concentrate on the latter by seeking battle. Hugh Trenchard , the first chief of the RAF  and its commander from 1919 to 1930, focused instead on the “will ” portion of that equation. Trenchard ’s influence on the RAF  cannot be overestimated. The near genius he brought to the task, despite his notoriously poor communicative skills, was crucial. Trenchard  believed that the airplane was an inherently strategic weapon, unmatched in its ability to shatter the will  of an enemy country. Yet, he could not erase the long British tradition of economic warfare . The result was a unique blend—an airpower theory  that advocated attacks designed to break the morale of factory workers by targeting  enemy industry and, by extension, the population as a whole. Trenchard ’s instinctive beliefs on this subject found 41  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 70 --- form in the official doctrine manuals  of the RAF . In turn, this doctrine  was taught and institutionalized at the RAF Staff College , where most of the officers who would lead their service in World War II  were educated. The most intellectually gifted man in this group, John “Jack” Slessor , had worked on Trenchard ’s staff in the late 1920s, and he understood airpower as well as anyone in the RAF . After attending the RAF Staff College , he spent three years instructing at the British Army Staff College . Combining his knowledge of aviation with the distinctive perspective of the army, he produced a brilliant book, Air Power and Armies —perhaps the best treatise on airpower theory  written in English before World War II . This chapter traces the evolution of RAF doctrine  between the wars, highlighting the special contributions of Hugh Trenchard  and John Slessor . Britain , like all other belligerents, entered the Great War with a small number of rudimentary aircraft but little or no doctrine  on how to employ them effecti
