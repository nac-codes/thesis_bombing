of Hugh Trenchard  and John Slessor . Britain , like all other belligerents, entered the Great War with a small number of rudimentary aircraft but little or no doctrine  on how to employ them effectively. Over the course of the next few years, the RAF, which became a separate service in 1918, grew to be the largest and most effective air arm in the world. Although airpower played a peripheral role throughout the conflict, its potential captivated the imagination of the public, politicians, and military thinkers. They were particularly enthusiastic over one particular aspect of airpower’s many roles and purposes—strategic bombing . The actual experiences of the bomber forces —scanty though they were—constituted a source of debate for the next two decades. In World War I , Germany  waged the first systematic strategic air campaign  in history. Beginning in early 1915, rigid airships—zeppelins —began making the long nighttime journey from their sheds on the North Sea  to drop bombs on military  and industrial targets  in Great Britain . At first, they conducted these attacks with impunity. But the British soon cobbled together fighter  planes, artillery, and searchlights into a makeshift air defense  system, 1 which was reasonably effective: the last great zeppelin  attack of the war occurred on 19 October 1917, when five out of 11 airships went down. 2 The Germans thereafter concentrated on large, multiengined aircraft—Gothas  and later Giants —that were faster and moreTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 42  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 71 --- maneuverable than the airships  and thus considerably more difficult to intercept and shoot down. It is difficult to exaggerate the fear, bordering on panic, that these bombing strikes caused among the British population and its government—for the next two decades. Because Britain  had remained sheltered behind its impassable moat for centuries, this fear proved worse than it would have been for a country that had no such traditi
