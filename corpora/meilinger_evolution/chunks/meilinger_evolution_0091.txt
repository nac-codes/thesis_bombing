was precarious, and Trenchard  realized the importance of the air arm’s protecting the fragile forces of Haig . Consequently, he envisioned an air campaign  focusing on what today we would term “interdiction ” targets: railroad marshaling yards, bridges, supply depots, and road networks that provided men and material for the front. As he phrased it, “I desire to emphasize that operations conducted by bombing squadrons cannot be isolated from other work in the air, and are inseparable from the operations of the Army as a whole. . .  . If an offensive is being undertaken on the ground, the work of bombing machines should be timed and co-ordinated so as to produce the maximum effect on the enemy.” 9 In addition, Trenchard  foresaw possibilities of more overarching value for strategic bombing  and singled out several industries  as particularly important: iron and coal mines, steel mills, chemical production facilities, explosive factories, miscellaneous armament industries, aero engines and magneto works, submarine and shipbuilding works, large gun foundries, and engine repair shops. Significantly, he selected many of these targets  on the basis of their large size and easy identification; blast furnaces, for example, had one-hundred-foot towers, and their fiery ovens could be seen for many miles at night. 10 The problems of navigation a nd targetMEILINGER 45  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 74 --- identification  hinted at here would continue for the next several decades. In his official report soon after the war, Trenchard  reiterated his previous stance that the aerial needs of the British army in France  had had first priority, but after his air forces met those needs, the bombing  of Germany  became “a necessity.” Its objective was to achieve “the breakdown of the German army  in Germany , its government, and the crippling of its sources of supply.” Recognizing that he had insufficient forces to collapse the German industry, he nonetheless attempted to
