re of his service; his relatively junior rank; his lack of a strong faction in Parliament , the press, or the public; and his notoriously poor writing and public speaking skills; his ability to get his way with the government and the other services was remarkable. When the government slashes funds, interservice rivalries tend to flare as the military arms begin to scramble for an adequate share of a severely shrinking budget —as was the case in postwar Britain . Determining who threw the first punch is difficult, but relations between Trenchard  and his service counterparts—Field Marshal Henry Wilson  and Adm David Beatty —were stormy, bordering on rude. Wilson  and Beatty  made no secret of their desire to disband the RAF  and restore its airplanes (few though they were) to the army and fleet from whence they came. For his part, Trenchard  fought back by noting the high cost in sterling and lives of traditional war making, costs dramatically reduced through airpower. For example, one Air Ministry  pamphlet suggested the existence of “certain responsibilities at present assigned to the Navy and Army which the Air Force is already  technically capable of undertaking, and for which it may be found economical in the near future to substitute to a greater or lesser extent air units for military or naval units” (emphasis inTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 48  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 77 --- original). 16 When the army  and navy  continued to push to disband the RAF  in the interests of economy, the CAS responded in a wonderfully Trenchardesque style : “The Field Marshal wishes to lay axe to the roots, as by doing so he thinks he may the easier obtain the fruit. What is wanted in order that the maximum amount of fruit may be got for our money is a severe pruning of the overhead fruitless branches of some of the neighboring trees which are at present crowding out the younger and more productive growth and thereby preventing its vigorous expansion to full maturity.” 17
