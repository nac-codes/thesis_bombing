verhead fruitless branches of some of the neighboring trees which are at present crowding out the younger and more productive growth and thereby preventing its vigorous expansion to full maturity.” 17 Given the increasingly heated verbal and bureaucratic sparring, it is surprising that Trenchard  was able to win a major concession from Beatty  and Wilson  in late 1921. Catching them off guard and appealing to their sense of fair play, Trenchard  convinced them to cease attacking his service for one year while he attempted to organize his fledgling command and make their struggle a more equal one. 18 The two men later regretted their decision, because Trenchard used that time to solidify his power, establish the RAF  on a strong organizational and administrative footing, and devise a use for the air weapon that would ensure its survival as a separate  service—air control of colonial territories. Administering the world’s largest empire was an expensive and labor-intensive enterprise, each colony requiring a garrison of sufficient size to maintain peace and order. In the aftermath of the war, such an expense caused consternation in the British government. In mid-1919, therefore, Trenchard suggested to Churchill  that the RAF  be given the opportunity to subdue a festering uprising in Somaliland . Churchill agreed. The results were dramatic: the RAF  chased the rebel ringleader, “the mad mullah,” out of the area and pacified Somaliland  at a cost of £77,000 rather than the £6 million it would have cost for the two army divisions originally planned. As a consequence, the demand for air control  grew quickly, and over the next decade the RAF  deployed—with varying degrees of success—to Iraq , Afghanistan , India , Ad en, Tra ns- jordan , Palestine , Egypt , and Sudan .19 The strategy employed in these campaigns involved patrolling the disputed areas, flying political representatives around to the various tribes to discuss problems and devise solutions, issuing ultimatums
