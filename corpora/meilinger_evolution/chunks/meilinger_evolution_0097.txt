strategy employed in these campaigns involved patrolling the disputed areas, flying political representatives around to the various tribes to discuss problems and devise solutions, issuing ultimatums toMEILINGER 49  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 78 --- recalcitrants if persuasion failed, and as a last resort, bombing selected rebel targets to compel compliance. To be sure, these air operations  were neither grand nor glorious, but they kept the RAF  alive while it sought a more suitable foe. This foe seemed to present itself in 1922, when continual arguments between Britain  and France  over occupation policy, trade, and colonial issues bubbled to the surface. For centuries, these two countries had been bitter rivals, and more recent cooperation had not yet hardened into goodwill and a meeting of the minds. Displeasure with France  turned to concern when the government received an intelligence report that showed a great and growing superiority in French air strength. France  allegedly had an air force  of 123 squadrons comprised of 1,090 aircraft and planned to expand to 220 squadrons of over two thousand aircraft—nearly 10 times the size of the RAF . To make matters worse, 20 of the RAF ’s 28 squadrons were stationed overseas, leaving a mere two fighter squadrons to defend the British Isles .20 Studies done by the RAF  speculated that if half the projected French air force  struck London , it could deliver one hundred tons of bombs in the first 24 hours, 75 tons in the second 24 hours, and 50 tons each day thereafter. Using the experience of the German air attacks  on London  during the Great War  as a guide, Britain  could expect to suffer an average of 50 casualties for each ton of bombs dropped (17 killed and 33 wounded). That is, French air strikes  would cause over 20,000 casualties in the first week of war. A maximum effort by the French would double those figures. 21 Although British leaders did not seriously believe that war with France  would
