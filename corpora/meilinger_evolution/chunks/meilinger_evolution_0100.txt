ters  as necessary. The ratio eventually arrived at was two to one. Thus, of the 52 squadrons designated for “home defense,” fully 35 were to be bombardment.26 Interestingly, this force ratio seemingly caused little debate at the time or, indeed, throughout most of the interwar period. Unlike the situation in the American Air Corps , where fighter advocates like Claire Chennault  argued vociferously for reduced emphasis on the bomber , no such open debate occurred in the RAF . Not until the late 1930s and the ascendance of Hugh Dowding  at Fighter Command  did anyone seriously question Trenchard ’s fundamental principles regarding force structure . The real key to the concept of strategic airpower  espoused by Trenchard  was the selection of targets . By this time, he had changed his views on the desirability of attacking enemy airfields in an effort to gain air superiority . During the war, the Independent Force  had directed fully 40 percent of its strikes against airfields, but these attacks had slight effect. As a result, he now envisioned a great air battle  taking place between opposing air forces. When one side gained the upper hand, it would then concentrate on paralyzing  the enemy nation and breaking its morale . Precisely how did he expect the morale  of an enemy to break? Like most airmen, he was frustratingly vague on this issue. Airpower was simply too new, and one sensed rather than understood the possibilities it offered to wage war in a fashion previously impossible. At its worst, such vagueness took the form of an address by Trenchard  in October 1928: “The objectives to be attacked will be centres which are essential for the continuance of the enemy’s resistance. They will vary frequently and the air forces will be directed against the one which at the moment is the best for air attack .”27 In another instance, he maintained that air attack  would “induce the enemy Government, by pressure from the population, to sue for peace, in exactly the same
