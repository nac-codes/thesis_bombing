In addition, he relied on two other avenues to formalize and institutionalize his beliefs on airpower: RAF doctrine  manuals and the Royal Air Force Staff College .30 In July 1922 the RAF  published its first doctrine manual , CD 22—titled simply Operations . To a great extent, CD 22 echoed the ideas Trenchard  had expounded since 1917, noting that air forces must cooperate with surface forces  because often the objective of a campaign was “the destruction of the enemy’s main forces.” It also stressed the importance of morale  in war and the idea that victory occurred when one imposed so much pressure on the people they would “force their government to sue for peace.” Regarding the importance of air superiority , it argued that other targets  were subsidiary and that one should not attempt them until one had inflicted “a serious reverse” on the enemy air force.31 The issue of which targets  would most effectively achieve the anticipated moral  effects was, as usual, unstated, although it did refer to naval bases, munitions factories, and railway junctions. 32 The manual did, however, point out that bombing  attacks were to be carried out in accordance with international law . Attacking “legitimate objectives” in populated areas was permissible, although one m
