manual did, however, point out that bombing  attacks were to be carried out in accordance with international law . Attacking “legitimate objectives” in populated areas was permissible, although one must take “all reasonable precautions” to spare hospitals and other privileged buildings. 33 This issue became the subject of much contention in the years ahead. Although air policing remained a major RAF  mission between the wars, the service did not want to hang its doctrinal hat on this mission since it garnered no glory and generated little force structure. CD 22 contained a chapter titled “Aircraft in Warfare against an Uncivilized Enemy” but clearly considered such operations of far less importance than conventional air warfare . The long-term effects of such air control  operations on RAF  thinking were mixed.MEILINGER 53  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 82 --- Operations  remained official doctrine  until July 1928, when it was superseded by AP 1300, Royal Air Force War Manual,  a more sophisticated effort that discussed air strategy  in a broader sense, yet reduced administrative and organizational material. Many of its arguments were the same as those in Operations:  war was largely a psychological effort; airpower was an inherently offensive weapon; airpower would serve as part of a joint force  in which all the services worked together to attain the government’s objectives; at times, the most effective use of airpower was to defeat the enemy’s army; and air superiority  was crucial to military success. The first major change concerned the sequence of the air superiority battle. Instead of directing that one resist all distractions until one decisively defeated the enemy air force, AP 1300 regarded the strategic bombing  campaign as primary and the air superiority  battle as a diversion.34 This reversal from previous doctrine no doubt reflected a desire to avoid the counterforce battle . The Great War  had degenerated into a bloody slugfest between
