92 --- enough to prevent the British army  from being overwhelmed. Therefore, air, land, and sea commanders had to cooperate to stop and perhaps drive back an enemy offensive. Nonetheless, Slessor ’s general comments regarding a strategic air campaign  are interesting. He had difficulty identifying the most lucrative targets; indeed, he recognized that most countries had several centers of gravity  that might change over time. Unlike some theorists, he carefully avoided equating strategic bombing  with a mechanistic destruction of target sets . One need not always obliterate the objective; rather, neutralization for a specific time period could be satisfactory. He used the example of a man’s windpipe: it was not necessary to sever it; simply interrupting it for a few minutes would achieve the same result. Further, Slessor  lent only tepid support to morale bombing . Although he appreciated the importance of psychological pressure, he saw the reduction of industrial capacity as both more practical and more quantifiable. Also stressing the need for industrial intelligence , he called for detailed technical expertise to ensure effective targeting . In this regard, he was obviously hinting at the concept then under consideration by the American Air Corps —the analysis of industrial systems to identify weak points or “bottlenecks.” In truth, these brief insights into strategic air warfare  are intriguing. It is interesting to speculate on what type of book Slessor  would have written had he instructed at Andover rather than Camberley. But we must be content with the book Slessor  did write. In it, he focused on the theater—what we now call the operational level of war —arguing that the neutralization of key nodes at that level would prevent effective operations. He decried people who advocated using airpower  as “flying artillery.” It was not a battlefield weapon; rather, he believed that one should attack the enemy repeatedly, as far from the battlefield as possible.
