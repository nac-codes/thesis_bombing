As a consequence, strong air defenses  combined with hundreds of new fighters  were in place in England  by 1940: Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding ’s Fighter Command  was ready for the Battle of Britain . The new war manual belatedly ratified these developments.68 As in previous manuals, AP 1300 took pains to stress that although the civilian populace was more involved than ever in the business of war, it was not, as such, a legitimate target . Consequently, the manual rejected area bombing : “All airMEILINGER 67  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 96 --- bombardment aims to hit a particular target,” and in every case “the bombing crew must be given an exact target and it must be impressed upon them that it is their task to hit and cause material damage to that target.” 69 Nonetheless, even if “the people” were not targets, “the workers” most certainly were, because they put weapons in the hands of soldiers and because they had a decisive grip on the actions of political leaders. The point in attacking certain industries  was thus not only to destroy the tools with which the enemy waged war, but to instill such fear in the people making the tools that they simply refused to show up for work. Hence, one should attack factories when the maximum number of workers are present. This scrupulous regard for precise targeting  of specific military objectives was not just for public consumption. The air targets committee in the Air Ministry  looked closely at potential target sets  in Germany and prepared an extensive list of suitable possibilities—specific military objectives such as oil, gas, electricity, chemicals, explosives, nonferrous metals, ferro alloys, the aircraft industry, iron and steel, roller bearings, raw materials, transportation, and optical glass. Seemingly, foodstuffs constituted an exception to this list, but they were a traditional objective of naval blockade and thus well established as a legitima
