terials, transportation, and optical glass. Seemingly, foodstuffs constituted an exception to this list, but they were a traditional objective of naval blockade and thus well established as a legitimate target in international law .70 In addition, a classified study written in 1938 by the Air Staff and endorsed by Air Commodore Slessor  (now director of plans), spelled out RAF  bombing  policy. The document noted that no internationally agreed-upon laws regarding air warfare existed—conferences convened since the turn of the century had failed to reach agreement. Consequently, air warfare tended to follow the same rules as did war at sea (which were much less restrictive than those for land warfare ). The key legal tenet guiding air leaders forbade the deliberate bombing of civilian populations: “A direct attack upon an enemy civil population . . . is a course of action which no British Air Staff would recommend and which no British Cabinet would sanction.”71 The Air Staff, however, worried that other countries did not share Britain ’s traditional respect for law. Specifically, one could hardly rely upon Nazi Germany , which had driven “a coach and four through half a dozen internationalTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 68  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 97 --- obligations,” to keep its word regarding the largely unwritten rules of air bombardment. Britain  must, therefore, maintain a defensive and offensive air capability that would prove effective, regardless of laws and agreements: “Expediency too often governs military policy and actions in war.” 72 This parting caveat was prophetic because expediency did in fact later shape British bombing  policy. But it seems clear that the RAF  leadership going into the war had drawn a clear line regarding the issue. One should also note that at the same time, lectures at Andover followed the line described above almost exactly. 73 This policy carried over into the war. The week before Germany  invaded Poland , the CAS sent a
