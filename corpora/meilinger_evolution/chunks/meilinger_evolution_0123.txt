so note that at the same time, lectures at Andover followed the line described above almost exactly. 73 This policy carried over into the war. The week before Germany  invaded Poland , the CAS sent a letter to Bomber Command  stating RAF  policy in the clearest of terms: “We should not initiate air action against other than purely military objectives in the narrowest sense of the word, i.e., Navy, Army and Air Forces and establishments, and that as far as possible we should confine it to objectives on which attack will not involve loss of civil life.” 74 During the campaign in France  the following year, the CAS reiterated this policy in a classified message to all RAF  commanders: the intentional bombing  of civilian populations as such was illegal.

Also included were power stations, oil refineries, and storage installations, as well as lines of communications and transportation serving military purposes. Following the provisions of international law  regarding land warfare , the directive concluded that “provided the principles set out above are observed [regarding the prohibition of deliberately bombing  the population] other objectives, the destruction of which is an immediate military necessity, may be attacked for particular reasons.” 76 To be sure, the motives for such restraint were not completely noble.
