The Air Staff reviewed the threat from antiaircraft and concluded blithely that it was insignificant. Based on experience in the war, guns expended over 11,000 shells to down a single aircraft. Not only did that rate wear out an average of two gun barrels but if one added the cost of ground crews, lights, and so forth, each downed plane cost the defender over £50,000. Moreover, the Air Staff saw no improvements in artillery since the war, and increased aircraft speed and altitude capability would compensate for any improvements in the future. “Notes on Anti-Aircraft Gunnery,” November 1926, Trenchard Papers, RAF Hendon, England, file CII/3/177–227. 26. “CAS Conference Minutes,” 10 July 1923, Public Records Office, Kew, England, file AIR 2/1267; and “Air Staff Memo No. 11A,” March 1924, Public Records Office, Kew, England, file AIR 8/71. 2
