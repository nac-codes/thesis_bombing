Alaska , which was at that point largely uninhabited wilderness, but the Army  sought to tie it closer to the lower states via telegraph. Mitchell ’s task was to string the necessary lines across this vast area. He later wrote of these experiences in an account that is both exciting and insightful. 5 Alaska  was a wild, open, forbidding, and unexplored country.

He learned the fundamentals of the new field quickly, and in 1905, while an instructor at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas , Captain Mitchell  wrote a field manual dealing with communications for the Army . Although most of the manual was a pedestrian description of Signal Corps  organization and equipment, the author noted the growing importance of balloons in the corps. The Germans, he wrote, had a
