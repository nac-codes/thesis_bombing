. Although most of the manual was a pedestrian description of Signal Corps  organization and equipment, the author noted the growing importance of balloons in the corps. The Germans, he wrote, had a significant balloon section attached to their army  that could provide valuable reconnaissance  information, via photography, to ground commanders . He then offered that rigid airships—dirigibles — were under development and were  far more capable than tethered balloons . Besides simple reconnaissance  work over the front lines, they could drop explosives on fortifications and even scout for the Navy . He concluded with a rather remarkable prophecy: “Conflicts no doubt will be carried on in the future in the air, on the surface of the earth and water, and under the earth and water.” 6 Written barely a year after the Wright brothers ’ first flight, this statement presaged Mitchell ’s views on air  and submarine warfare  in the decades ahead. Mitchell ’s Signal Corps  service both hindered and helped his future aviation career. On the one hand, signals officers—especially those like Mitchell , who had not attended West Point —seldom rose to high rank in the Army  and were treated with far less deference than were officers from the combat arms of infantry, cavalry, and artillery. As a result, brother officers could dismiss Mitchell  as a dilettante and refuse to take his ideas on warfare seriously. On the other hand, the close association with technology —the Signal Corps was a leader in this area within the Army —was of great importance to the new field of aviation. This technical bent manifested itself in Mitchell ’s later predictions regarding such exotic innovations as cruise missiles , glide bombs , jet propulsion, supersonic flight, and space travel. Although such prophecies often earned wry smiles at the time, he was proven correct in a surprisingly short period of time. 7 Mitchell ’s main focus, however, did not immediately turn to visions of airpower.
