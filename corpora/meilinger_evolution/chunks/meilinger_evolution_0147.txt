operations during this Spring and Summer, rather than a piece-meal attack against large factory sites and things of that nature. The factories, if completely destroyed, would undoubtedly have a very far-reaching effect, but to completely demolish them is a tremendously difficult thing, and, furthermore, even if they were ruined, their effect would not be felt for a long period of time (possibly a year) upon the fighting of their army. 21 “The Air Service  of an army is one of its offensive arms,” he stated after taking command in the Zone of the Advance : “Alone it cannot bring about a decision. It therefore helps the other arms in their appointed missions.” 22 Near the end of the war, Mitchell  demonstrated his ability to manage a large operation by massing fifteen hundred Allied aircraft, most supplied by the French and British, to back Pershing ’s drive at Saint-Mihiel . Tactically, the operation was a great success and added enormously to Mitchell ’s confidence and reputation within the Air Service . Mitchell  displayed strategic creativity as well. In October 1918, he proposed to Pershing  that Handley Page  bombersTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 86  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 115 --- drop the 1st Infantry Division  by parachute behind German lines at Metz .

Mitchell stated that the British bombers  could easily carry 10 to 15 soldiers each and could later parachute supplies to them. Afterwards, he claimed that Pershing  tentatively approved the plan, but the war ended before it could be implemented. 23 Although Pershing  was probably not as sanguine about the plan’s prospects as Mitchell  believed, the idea was highly original. Further, it indicated that Mitchell ’s airpower emphasis remained on the land battle . Once assured of a continued American advance on the ground, however, Mitchell ’s focus returned to the possibilities of strategic bombing . As long as
