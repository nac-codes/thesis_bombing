airpower emphasis remained on the land battle . Once assured of a continued American advance on the ground, however, Mitchell ’s focus returned to the possibilities of strategic bombing . As long as the Army ’s progress remained uncertain, he devoted his full energies to providing it with immediate air support. Of course, Mitchell ’s ego had much to do with his pragmatic approach to airpower—he craved a combat command, and the only combat air commands available were those attached to Army  headquarters. Still, by the summer of 1918, he realized that America ’s major contribution to the Allied advance would be made by the ground  echelons of the AEF  and that air support  could enhance their impact. Had the war continued into 1919, Mitchell , assured of a continuing American advance on the ground, planned an aerial assault against the interior of Germany . “I was sure that if the war lasted, air power would decide it,” he wrote after the armistice .24 According to his memoirs, he planned to combine incendiary attacks  with poison gas  to destroy crops, forests, and livestock. This air offensive , he mused, “would have caused untold sufferings and forced a German surrender.” 25 Yet, the likelihood of Mitchell ’s vision becoming reality was remote. On 4 November 1918, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker  told Gen Peyton March , Army chief of staff, to notify the Air Service  that the United States  would not conduct any bombing  that “has as its objective, promiscuous bombing upon industry, commerce, or population, in enemy countries disassociated from obvious military needs to be served by such action.”26 Moreover, in early January 1919, Mitchell revealed that his notion of strategic bombing  had come toCLODFELTER 87  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 116 --- resemble Gorrell ’s plan for bombing  key German war industries. In a treatise entitled “Tactical Application of Military Aeronautics,” he argued that the main value of bombardment would come from “hitting
