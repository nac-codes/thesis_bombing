air officers who stressed “independent” air operations: “It is therefore directed that these officers be warned against any idea of independence and that they be taught from the beginning that their efforts must be closely coordinated with those of the remainder of the Air Service  and those of the ground army.” 29 Mitchell  believed that such nonflyers had little appreciation for the airplane’s unique capabilities, and he bemoaned their efforts to restrict aviation to battlefield support. He stated that Army  officers—with theTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 88  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 117 --- sole exception of Maj Gen Hunter Liggett , who had commanded First Army —did not know what airpower meant. 30 The independent streak noted in Mitchell ’s early career manifested itself in France  in his dealings with his superior, Brig Gen Benny Foulois , one of the Army ’s first and most accomplished pilots—indeed, the Wright brothers  themselves had taught him to fly in 1909.

Yet, when Foulois  arrived in France  in November 1917 to take charge of American air operations, Mitchell —who had been in place for six months and thus felt he should be granted seniority—was outraged and did not try to hide his feelings. In his memoirs, he referred to Foulois  as a “nonflyer” and “carpetbagger” who imposed his authority without taking into consideration Mitchell ’s experience in the theater. Mitchell , though, had learned to fly barely two years previously and still required the services of another pilot whenever he took to the air.
