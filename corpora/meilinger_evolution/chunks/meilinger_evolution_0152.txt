The wartime application of airpower would, Mitchell  contended, “result in a diminished loss of life and treasure and will thus be a distinct benefit to civilization.”34 His unabashed faith that airpower had altered the nature of war caused him to demand an air force separate from Army  or Navy  control, to guarantee its proper use. Moreover, this separate air force  had to be commanded by an airman. In 1925 he testified before the Morrow Board  that “the one thing that has been definitely proved in all flying services is that a man must be an airman to handle air power. In every instance of which I have known or heard the result of placing other than air officers in charge of air power has ended in failure.” 35 Mitchell ’s belief that air warfare  was unique complemented his conviction that only a distinctive class of combatants could wage it. He often referred to a “community of airmen” and the “air-going people” who thought and acted differently than their earthbound counterparts. 36 His vision was one of aerial knights engaged in a chivalrous contest and supported by the population at large. This romantic notion was both incongruous and appealing after the horrors of trench warfare . Much like the muckrakers who preceded him, Mitchell  took his case directly to the American public: “Changes in military systems come about only through the pressure of public opinion or disaster in war.” 37 In his mind, surface officers were too conservative and hidebound to make the changes necessary to wage modern war. As a consequence, Mitchell aimed for the American people to compel the country’sTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 90  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 119 --- political leadership to create an independent air force .
