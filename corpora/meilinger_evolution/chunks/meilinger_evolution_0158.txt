s penchant for seeking public support for his notions. He was certain that the Army  leadership would never endorse his desire for air force  autonomy because his beliefs clashed with the Army ’s traditional views on airpower’s “proper” role in war; thus, he appealed to the American populace. He understood full well the Army ’s desire to guarantee that it received adequate air support for its ground forces —he had provided that backing in France  during the war, and he did not dismiss the need for it afterwards. Indeed, in his writings immediately after the war, he stressed the importance not only of supporting the other  services but also of deliberately using airpower to attack enemy forces directly.THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 94  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 123 --- In other words, Mitchell  was arguing that even with the advent of the airplane, wars were still won the old-fashioned way—by destroying armies and navies. Only now, the airplane made that task easier and less costly. Thus, in 1921 he advocated a balanced air force, one that consisted largely of pursuit  (60 percent) with the remainder evenly divided between bombardment  and attack .48 This early emphasis on the primacy of pursuit distinguished him from his contemporaries Trenchard  and Douhet . Soon, however, Mitchell  abandoned this position, calling instead for an air force based largely on bombardment. One reason for Mitchell ’s shift towards the bomber  was the realization that auxiliary airpower offered meager prospects for overcoming the murderous technology  of modern land warfare —or for justifying an autonomous air force . As long as ground advance remained the primary means to achieve victory (and Army  leaders had little incentive to change that emphasis), the bomber ’s ability to revamp war remained limited. “Should a War take place on the ground between two industrial nations in the future,” Mitchell  wrote in 1926, “it can only end in absolute ruin, if the same methods that the gr
