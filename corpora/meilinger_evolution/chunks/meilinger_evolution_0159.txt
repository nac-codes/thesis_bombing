war remained limited. “Should a War take place on the ground between two industrial nations in the future,” Mitchell  wrote in 1926, “it can only end in absolute ruin, if the same methods that the ground armies have followed before should be resorted to.” 49 In contrast, independently applied airpower presented an opportunity to decide a war by avoiding stalemate and slaughter. Mitchell  maintained that airpower could defeat a nation by paralyzing its “vital centers ” and thus its ability to continue hostilities. Those centers  included great cities where people lived, factories, raw materials, foodstuffs, supplies, and modes of transportation. 50 All were essential to wage modern war, and all were vulnerable to air attack . Moreover, many of the targets were fragile, and wrecking them promised a rapid victory. Mitchell  asserted that air forces will attack centers of production of all kinds, means of transportation, agricultural areas, ports and shipping; not so much the people themselves. They will destroy the means of making war, because now we cannot cut a limb out of a tree, pick a stone from a hill and make it our principal weapon. Today to make war we must have great metal and chemical factories that have to stay in one place, take months to build, and, if destroyed, cannot be replaced in the usual length of a modern war. 51CLODFELTER 95  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 124 --- Only an air force possessed the means to attack vital centers  without first confronting enemy surface forces , and destroying those centers  would eliminate the need to advance through enemy territory on the ground. “The influence of air power on the ability of one nation to impress its will on another in an armed conflict will be decisive,” he insisted. 52 Like many Army  officers of his time, Mitchell  could recite Clausewitz ’s dictum on the objective of war, but he did so with a parochial twist. Airpower would wreck an enemy’s will  to fight by destroying his capabilit
