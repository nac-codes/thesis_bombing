operate effectively “until the air forces have first obtained a decision against the opposing air force.” He was convinced that the first battles of a future war would be air battles  and that the nation which won them was “practically certain to win the whole war.” 60 In this emphasis on the importance of the air battle , Mitchell  mirrored his contemporary in Italy , Giulio Douhet . Mitchell  later stated that he had “frequent conversations” with Douhet  during his visit to Italy  in 1922; at any rate, he was well acquainted with Douhet ’s confidant—the aircraft designer and manufacturer Gianni Caproni —and received a synopsis of Douhet ’s classic book The Command of the Air  in late 1922. 61 Much of Mitchell ’s and Douhet ’s writing was remarkably similar. 62 Both agreed that “nothing can stop the attack of aircraft except other aircraft” and that after achieving air supremacy , an enemy’s vital centers —a term used by both men—could be wrecked at will.63 They differed, however, about how best to achieve air control . For Douhet , the best method was to destroy the enemy air force on the ground, either at its bases or before it left factory assembly lines. 64 Mitchell  argued that air combat  was also a suitable means and that attacking a critical vital center  would compel the hostile air force to take to the air in defense, where it could be overcome.65 Both thought that escort fighters  for bombers were essential to ward off the enemy’s fighters , althoughTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 98  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 127 --- Douhet  advocated an air force based on a single type of aircraft—a bomber  bristling with machine guns that he dubbed the “battle plane ” in his 1927 revision to The Command of the Air . Like Mitchell , Douhet  argued that an independent air force built around the bomber  was the cheapest and most efficient means to defend his nation. Unlike his American counterpart, Douhet  had to consider that his country was susceptible to air atta
