25–30 million; in 1934 appropriations fell to $12 million for the year; in 1938 to $3.5 million. 86 Manpower, which averaged fifteen hundred officers and 15,000 enlisted men during the first three Depression  years, stood at only 17,000 men and seventeen hundred officers as late as 1939. 87 Aircraft totaled 1,619 in 1933, of which 442 were obsolete or nonstandard. 88 Still, the recommendation of the 1934 aviation board chaired by former secretary of war Newton Baker  led to the creation of a GHQ Air Force , containing all Air Corps  combat units, in the spring of 1935. Although the airpower comprising the GHQ Air Force  was never significant—in 1939 it owned just 14CLODFELTER 105  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 134 --- four-engined B-17  bombers—it nonetheless was one step closer towards Mitchell ’s progressive vision of an autonomous air force  capable of achieving an independent victory. Establishment of the GHQ Air Force  did not indicate that either the nation or the Army  had accepted Mitchell ’s airpower ideology. The Baker Board ’s final report cautioned that “the ideas that aviation, acting alone, can control the sea lanes, or defend the coast, or produce decisive results in any other general mission contemplated under our policy are all visionary, as is the idea that a very large and independent air force  is necessary to defend our country against air attack .”89 The primary bomber assigned to the GHQ Air Force ’s three air wings at the end of the decade was the Douglas B-18 “Bolo,”  a dual-engined aircraft designed for short-range interdiction  or battlefield support. The War Department  ordered 217 B-18s  in 1935 over the objections of the Air Corps , which had endorsed the B-17 . To most General Staff officers, airpower meant preventing enemy aircraft from attacking friendly troops or using friendly aircraft to attack enemy troops and supplies near the battlefield. It did not mean achieving victory from the sky—a proposition that many Army
