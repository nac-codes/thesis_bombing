founded on the bomber . Mitchell ’s progressive vision of airpower applied against an enemy’s war-making capability and will to resist will likely endure among American airmen. Perhaps Mitchell , had he lived to see the modern age of limited war , would have recanted his increasingly bold assertions regarding airpower’s ability to achieve a cheap, quick victory. Still, Mitchell  remains America ’s foremost airpower prophet. His vision included the development of precision-guided munitions , remotely piloted vehicles , stealth aircraft , and drop tanks , as well as the creation of the Federal Aeronautics Administration  and the Department of Defense .

Mitchell had outranked Foulois, an ex-enlisted man, before the war, so when Gen John J. Pershing elevated him to chief of the Air Service in November 1917, Mitchell was furious. His dislike of Foulois endured long after the war. Gorrell had become chief of the Air Service’s Technical Section because of Mitchell’s recommendation, but the friendship between the two disappeared once Gorrell joined Pershing’s staff and began no-notice inspections of Mitchell’s squadrons.

Shiner, Foulois and the U.S. Army Air Corps, 1931–1935  (Washington, D.C.: Office of Air Force History, 1983), 9–11; and William Mitchell to Benjamin Foulois, letter, 19 July 1918, Mitchell Papers,
