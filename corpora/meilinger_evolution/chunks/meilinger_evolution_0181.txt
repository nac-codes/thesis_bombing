Mitchell, who continually voiced progressive notions, used the term directly in the foreword to his book Winged Defense:  “The time has come when aviation must be developed for aviation’s sake and not as an auxiliary to other existing branches [of the service]. Unless the progressive elements in our makeup are availed of, we will fall behind in the world’s development.” William Mitchell, Winged Defense  (New York: G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1925), x. 34.
