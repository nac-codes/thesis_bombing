Practically all officers were graduates of the Naval Academy , and the bulk of the seniormost officers had been through the Naval War College —and on the eve of World War I , some of the juniors were well indoctrinated through correspondence courses. 7 There was a rather strong commitment to the idea that both study and practical experience were vital to understanding naval war.
