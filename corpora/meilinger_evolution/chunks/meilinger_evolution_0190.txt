questioned the idea that the Navy  constituted the first line of defense.METS 117  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 146 --- Ideal Organization for War The effectiveness of the bureau organization was often debated, and the notion that the planning and operations functions should remain paramount and governed by a professional naval officer was very strong. Previously divided into line and engineering categories, a division that had caused much difficulty, the officers of the Navy  found themselves reunified, first in the curriculum at the Naval Academy  and then on the line of the Navy —both before 1900.9 Strong sentiment favored avoiding such divisions. 10 At the beginning of the era of flight, then, the US Navy ’s officer corps tended to consider the world as being made up of nation-states—always in conflict, sometimes at war, and never recognizing any superior authority. Achieving command of the sea remained the first objective for naval forces; that done, a variety of naval measures could help in realizing the nation’s goals ashore. As yet, little thought existed about radical changes in the relationship of the Navy  to the rest of the US national security  structure. Most thinking held that one should be a naval officer first and a deck or engineering officer second—that the officer corps should be a monolithic whole. Even Lt Commander Henry Mustin  himself argued before World War I  that to be competent as a naval aviator, an officer would need a comprehensive knowledge of the duties of the surface mariner. Because acquiring that knowledge took so long, he believed that trainees for aviation must come from the line of the Navy .11 Though, in time, Mustin  would argue otherwise, the organizational implication of his belief was that one should refrain from further attempts at specialized corps (notwithstanding the continued existence of the Marine Corps )—despite the fact that the fleet itself was organized along functional lines according to ship type
