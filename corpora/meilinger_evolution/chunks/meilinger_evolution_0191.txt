further attempts at specialized corps (notwithstanding the continued existence of the Marine Corps )—despite the fact that the fleet itself was organized along functional lines according to ship type. Some members of the officer corps felt that the bureau chiefs were too independent and that the creation of the office of Chief of Naval Operations (CNO)  was a good thing. As for the employment of navies, the consensus was that decision would come through a great sea battle  between battleships  and that all other vessels and organizations existed to support the main battle line.THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 118  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 147 --- Evolution of American Naval Air Thinking before Pearl Harbor Naval aviators had experimented with aviation in combat against Mexico  even before World War I .12 Pilots had made landings and takeoffs from ships as well, and people harbored serious questions about whether the main air effort would lie with airships  (lighter-than-air), flying boats, or shipborne airplanes. 13 The Navy  had substantial experience with aviation in World War I , both in overwater antisubmarine patrol and land combat  on the western front . None of that was part of major fleet action in open ocean. Henry Mustin , one of the first wave of Navy  flyers, was only one of many men who brought back perceptions of air war from Europe .14 As with the Army ’s Air Service , however, one could draw no definitive inferences because technology  was still in its infancy, and none of the exploits even approached being decisive. 15 Only the Battle of Jutland  resembled the Mahanian  great battle, but because of its indecisiveness, its implications remained unclear. 16 Aviation played little role in that battle, and its impact on the antisubmarine war  was significant but not decisive. Aircraft forced submarines  to remain submerged and, by closing the Strait of Dover , imposed the long trip around Scotland  on them. The consequent reduction of the time on
