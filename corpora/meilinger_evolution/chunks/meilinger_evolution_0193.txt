the Navy  to accept change. One factor was the Five Power Treaty of 1922, which drove the Navy  to embrace aircraft carriers more rapidly than it might otherwise have done. 20 A second was the implicit threat that if the Navy  itself did not move smartly into the era of flight, then the upstart Air Service  and, later, the Air Corps  would gather maritime aviation  unto itself.21 As yet, only a few officers, such as Adm William Sims and Adm William Fullam , questioned whether the carrier  or the battleship  would be the capital ship  of the future—a question that remained open until after Pearl Harbor . Methods of Conflict Resolution One sees a sample of the cast of mind of the earliest crop of aviators in a lecture delivered by Commander Patrick Bellinger at the Naval War College  in the summer of 1924. He allowed that naval aviation  had other roles, such as cooperation with the Army  in coast defense , but clearly his concentration remained on aviation as an adjunct to the fleet. 22 Despite the presence of many skeptical mossbacks not disposed to change, some naval officers did not need external prods to revise their thinking—Sims  and Moffett  for example.23 However, notions that one might bypass the great sea battle  through a direct air attack  on the enemy’s economic, cultural, and moral fabric appeared infrequently among their published and unpublished writings. Such interpretations appeared only because the writer (e.g., Capt George Westervelt  in 1917 and Adm William Pratt  in 1926) questioned the morality of such operations and theTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 120  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 149 --- validity of Douhet ’s notion that attacks on civilian morale would be humane because they would end the war quickly and thereby eliminate the danger of another misery in the trenches. Westervelt , even in 1917, showed considerable insight in suggesting that in the short term, the German attacks may have had military value in that they diverted very cons
