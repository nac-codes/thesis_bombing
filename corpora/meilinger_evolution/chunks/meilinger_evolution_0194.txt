ther misery in the trenches. Westervelt , even in 1917, showed considerable insight in suggesting that in the short term, the German attacks may have had military value in that they diverted very considerable military potential from the fighting front for the largely futile defense of London . In the long term, however, he speculated that Germany  might come to regret it. He thought the attacks might even toughen British civilian morale  on the one hand and, on the other, act as a stimulus for greater and more destructive reprisals on the Germans by British  and French air forces .24 At the end of World War I , the General Board of the Navy — made up of a group of the service’s seniormost officers, necessarily nonaviators at that time—advised the secretary on fundamental issues affecting the life of the organization. In 1919, before Billy Mitchell ’s bombing tests, the board held formal hearings and explicitly advised the secretary that the integration of aviation into the fleet was of the highest priority. 25 Further, one should not infer that all the logic was on the side of the aviators and that the “gun club” was irrational in its arguments. 26 Had the flying boat  proven practical in timely reconnaissance  and spotting  support in midocean areas in the 1920s, it might have been a better solution to the air problem than either catapult-launched or carrier-launched aircraft . Indeed, flying-boat technology  was much more mature than that of the other craft, and aircraft operated from catapults or platforms atop turrets probably would have reduced the fields of fire as well as the volume and rate of fire of the main armament. (Although aerial observation would radically enhance the accuracy of fire, more might be lost than gained.) Moreover, it was hard to imagine ever developing the means of recovering such catapulted aircraft without stopping the ship—clearly suicidal in the presence of enemy surface ships or submarines .27 On the other hand, if one accepted the
