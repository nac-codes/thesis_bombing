s, and their security with the fleet posed constraints on the offensive preferences of the commanders. 29 Many people made similar arguments in favor of airships . Thus, the thinking of the gun club was not nearly as Neanderthal as it might appear to observers looking back from the post–Pearl Harbor  period. The common flaw to that thinking was that if a force had no carrier aircraft , an enemy with carrier planes  could deny the use of the air over the battle area to the former’s catapult airplanes, flying boats, and lighter-than-air craft—and thus could produce an enormous advantage for his own battle fleet . Decisiveness would arise from the fact that the side with air superiority  would be able to take its enemy under concentrated, accurate fire at long ranges and during impaired visibility while the other side could not. 30THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 122  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 151 --- Worldview: Continuity and Change From about 1906, we considered the Japanese a potential enemy, though continuing some war games  with a Japanese-British enemy alliance until well after World War I .31 After the demise of German admiral Alfred von Tirpitz ’s fleet at Scapa Flow , both the games and the thinking increasingly concentrated on a Pacific war  against Japan —although we did not completely discount war against the British. 32 Capt Yates Stirling  Jr. provided us with a near-classical statement in Mahanian  terms. In an article published in 1925, he painted a worldview in which seafaring capitalist nations had to have overseas trade to survive; to do that, they had to protect that trade with navies; those navies would have to have battleships to command the sea or part of it; and only Japan  and Great Britain  were in the game. Although Stirling  more clearly identified Japan  as a potential enemy, he plainly asserted that competition with Great Britain  was inevitable and that only the statesmanlike work of the Washington  treaties promised to contain that c
