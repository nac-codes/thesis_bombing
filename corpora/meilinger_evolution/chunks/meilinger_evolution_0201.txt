that any admiral who lost that spotting  capability found himself at a huge disadvantage. 45 The corollary to that principle, as on the western front , was that one had to make every effort to protect free use of the air over the battle and to deny it to the enemy. Thus, hardly anyone in any of the services needed much persuasion that command of the air remained a paramount consideration. In 1926, Admiral Pratt  himself argued that it was a primary function of naval aviation. 46 Although in the 1930s, mainstream thought seldom wavered from the idea that the primary and final instrument of victory would be the battleship , it held that Japan  would refuse battle until the combat power of the US Navy  had been diminished by projecting itself all the way across the central Pacific. Most strategic thinkers felt that the Navy  could minimize this weakening if the US offensive went across the central (instead of the north or south) Pacific , invading and building up island bases as it went (as opposed to making one giant leap that would force the Japanese navy  to come out and fight for the sea when the Americans arrived in the vicinity of the Philippines ). Carrier airpower  would always be a scarce commodity. In those days, people deemed land-based airpower  a formidable threat. Without air bases to protect theTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 126  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 155 --- line of communications and naval bases to attenuate the erosion of sea power  as it projected further across the Pacific , the defeat of the Japanese fleet  on the other side remained improbable. 47 In all of this, aviation  had two main functions. First, it would enhance the effectiveness of the cruisers and destroyers of the scouting fleet through reconnaissance . Second, it would enhance the effectiveness of the battle fleet  through conducting reconnaissance , spotting the fall of shot, and defending against the enemyâ€™s carrier airpower  (usually through sinking or disabling enemy car
