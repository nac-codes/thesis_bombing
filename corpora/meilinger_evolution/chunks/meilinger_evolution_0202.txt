he effectiveness of the battle fleet  through conducting reconnaissance , spotting the fall of shot, and defending against the enemy’s carrier airpower  (usually through sinking or disabling enemy carriers .)48 Sometimes, aircraft might attack battleships , but usually they sought to slow them down so that the plodding American battleships could catch up with the speedier Japanese dreadnoughts to administer decisive blows with their guns. 49 Not long before his death, Admiral Moffett  spoke of using offensive carrier aircraft  in exactly that way to facilitate the great sea battle .50 Even up to the eve of World War II , aviators who delivered lectures at the Naval War College  on the uses of airpower were clearly reluctant to claim too much for airplanes versus battleships .51 To a large degree, students of the intellectual history of any military force must grapple with an eternal problem: was the glass half full or half empty? Much of the final judgment necessarily resides in the eye of the beholder. Charles Melhorn and Curtis Utz  have demonstrated that declared policy and doctrine  do not always match the undeclared worldview of the decision makers  of any organization. 52 To some extent, the articulation of official doctrine  inevitably lags. Sometimes, acquisition policies indicate the difference between declared doctrine  and the undeclared vision of the future. They both show that the Navy  did make progress in aviation between the armistice  and Pearl Harbor —in fact, there were almost as many carriers  as battleships  under construction on 7 December 1941. Those “flattops” under construction were close to double the size of the USS  Ranger —the first American carrier  designed as such from the keel up. The task force  idea developed well before the onset of war, having its genesis even before the initial “fleet problems” of the late 1920s, in which the Saratoga  and Lexington  participated. 53METS 127  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 156 --- In
