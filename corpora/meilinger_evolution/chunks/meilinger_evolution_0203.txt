ar, having its genesis even before the initial “fleet problems” of the late 1920s, in which the Saratoga  and Lexington  participated. 53METS 127  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 156 --- In the late 1930s, the deck loads of carriers  had changed substantially in an offensive direction before they were thrust into battle. Thus, naval aviators of the period and their earliest biographers and historians possibly exaggerated the weight of US Navy  conservatism for a number of reasons. 54 One was physical: dive-bombers  in 1930 could not carry bombs big enough to penetrate battleship  armor far enough to threaten the enemy battle line; by the end of the decade, they could.55 Clark Reynolds , long a leader in the history of naval aviation, provides a recent sample of the “half empty” part of the metaphor: “The rigid conservatism of the so-called Gun Club of battleship  admirals stood in his [Moffett ’s] way at every turn.” 56 Clearly, “rigid conservatism” can be in the eye of the beholder; Moffett  himself had been a first-class battleship  captain . On the eve of war, then, the worldview of the naval officer corps had not changed much from the realist perception of the international environment held at the beginning of World War I .57 Few people in the Navy  felt that the initial objective ought to be anything other than command of the sea, which would yield the capability for exploitation in a variety of ways, such as invasion or blockade . Nor did they lend much support to the idea of bypassing sea battles , blockades , or invasions in favor of a direct attack on the morale  or industrial vital  targets of an enemy. Sentiment remained strongly opposed to a separate air force —and strongly in favor of the Navy ’s having its own air arm. Mitchell  had not persuaded many people in the sea services of the desirability of a unified department of defense . As regards internal organization, war at sea involving the use of aircraft required a task organization that
