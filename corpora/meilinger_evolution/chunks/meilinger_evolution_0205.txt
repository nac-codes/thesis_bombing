The destruction by land-based airpower  of the Prince of Wales  and the Repulse —both capital ships  and both under way —had a far greater psychological impact on both the Navy  and the American public. This, combined with the fact that precious few battleships  remained with which to test the old notions in combat, led to the rapid acceptance of the carrier task force  as the principal instrument of sea power .58 Objectives Notwithstanding the fact that implementation in war differed from that envisioned, the preferred strategy of the Navy  remained the same.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff  did not have the power or the inclination to force the Navy  into another choice—or to persuade Douglas MacArthur  in the Southwest Pacific Area to join the Navy ’s strategy.
