was coming out of two decades of serious deficit spending, and Billy Mitchell ’s idea of getting the job done with one air force instead of a two-ocean navy—especially an air force equipped with nuclear weapons —was highly attractive to President Truman , the Congress , and the public in general. Doing this in a unified department of defense  would eliminate much duplication and make available more ample funds for domestic purposes. 72 Attempts to resolve the dilemma were made in the Unification Act of 1947  and the Key West  and Newport conferences  of the following year. However, they really did not achieve much. Back in the days of Billy Mitchell , most of the Navy ’s officer corps had been dead set against a single military department containing all the services. But during World War II, some senior officers thought that unification might have some merit. Admiral Nimitz  was one of them, but toward the end of the war, he and the rest of the mariners closed ranks against it. 73 Led by James V. Forrestal , the tactics entailed avoiding a head-on attack on the issues of unification and a separate air force  because support for them was too strong— indeed, the president himself favored unification. Thus, the approach was to limit the function of a secretary of defense to powers of “coordination,” avoid opposing a separate air force directly, but try to constrain its functions as much asMETS 133  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 162 --- possible. Especially important as a goal was assuring the Marine Corps  and the Navy  of their own air arms, completely independent of any autonomous air force . Minority opinions inside the Navy  (e.g., that of Adm Dan Gallery ) proposed that since all the old visions were obsolete, the Navy  ought to take over the Air Force ’s strategic bombing role because the Navy  could do it better. 74 The legislation had emerged rather as envisioned by Forrestal , but neither that nor the subsequent Key West  and Newport “agreements”
