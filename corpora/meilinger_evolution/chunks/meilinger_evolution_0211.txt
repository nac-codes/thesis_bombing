strategic bombing role because the Navy  could do it better. 74 The legislation had emerged rather as envisioned by Forrestal , but neither that nor the subsequent Key West  and Newport “agreements” calmed the waters. Perhaps the subsequent B-36  debate was a manifestation of the insecurity of naval leaders, and the main outlines of a more stable Navy  worldview and vision for its future started to take shape only later as a result of the Korean War  and the reversal of the decline of defense spending . Also having an effect were the march of technology that resulted in the miniaturization of nuclear weapons ; the Soviet acquisition of nuclear technology ; the coming of the nuclear submarines ; and the submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM) .75 The Navy ’s internal organizational issues had largely been laid to rest. The powers of the CNO  had been further consolidated under the wartime leader, Admiral King , when he was appointed to that office and at the same time retained the title of commander in chief of the US fleet . The flyers had become firmly integrated into the upper ranks of the Navy , and little agitation remained for a separate naval air corps. 76 Visions of Employment in War The vision to emerge in the mid-1950s held that the United States  could exploit its command of the seas with a revised naval role—one that had both a strategic and conventional dimension. The Navy  could use its carriers  as it had in the Korean War —for power projection  ashore. They would have nuclear weapons , not to take over the strategic bombing mission, but to facilitate the maritime campaign by targeting against Soviet submarine  bases and the like. The SLBM  would give new life to the underwater arm of the Navy , even in the absence of a potential enemy with a significant surface naval or merchant marine dependency.
