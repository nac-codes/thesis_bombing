That is, Polaris  missile boats were invulnerable enough to ride out the first strike, yet their accuracy was not deemed sufficient to threaten a first strike themselves—thus they added to deterrent  stability. Further, the great transfer of submarine technology , doctrine, and equipment from Germany  to the Soviet Union  at the end of World War II —combined with the contemporaneous change in antisubmarine warfare (ASW)  technique—assured the future of the attack-boat portion of the submarine force. 77 Thenceforward, one of the chief antisubmarine weapons  would be submarines . The line officers’ preference for the offensive again received expression in the notion of attacking the Soviet underwater forces well forward: in their home waters with ASW  submarines  and at their bases with naval air forces, soon to be armed with nuclear weapons .78 By the late 1950s, the reappearance of the naval nuclear camel’s nose under the Air Force ’s strategic tent was not as threatening as it had been in Admiral Gallery ’s version of the late 1940s. The new conception called for a strategic triad , two legs of which would belong to the Air Force  (ICBMs  and heavy bombers ) and all of which were vital to deterrence  and nuclear stability. The Air Force , moreover, was no longer the new kid on the block and therefore had more confidence in its own role.79 The Navy ’s new vision proved remarkably durable, and recent writings from Maritime Strategy  to From the Sea 80 are really little more than a change in emphasis. Impact of Aviation on Naval Air Thought Aviation had not really changed the worldview of most of the Navy ’s officers corps by 1947. In a generic way, the primary objective of navies remained command of the sea, although not much of a challeng
