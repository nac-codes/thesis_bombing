For an equally clear preference by another of the early flyers, see P. N. L. Bellinger, “Lecture Delivered by Commander P. N. L. Bellinger, Aviation, 1 Aug 1924,” 12, in NWC History Collection. 7.

Mahan was only one of the most prominent officer-historians; he reached the presidency of the American Historical Association in 1902, after his many historical writings on the history of sea power had achieved worldwide notice. See also Philip A. Crowl, “Alfred Thayer Mahan: The Naval Historian,” in Peter Paret, ed., Makers of Modern Strategy  (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1986), 444–54. The USNI itself was established in the 1870s, as was its journal Proceedings,  which from the earliest times contained many articles of a historical nature. See Philip A. Crowl, “Education versus Training at the Naval War College: 1884–1972,” Naval War College Review  26 (November–December 1973): 2–10. Carl H. Builder in The Masks of War: American Military Styles in Strategy and Analysis  (Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989), 18, also argues that the Navy, above the other services, values tradition; I suppose that has some affinity for a historical approach to things.
