Writing at the time of the Vietnam War, Rear Adm Dan V. Gallery was only one of many people who looked askance at arms control but who nonetheless thought that the Five Power Treaty helped push carrier development along.

In this lecture, Craven reported that he understood that the Royal Navy had lost its aviation to the RAF precisely because it had not moved vigorously to develop it itself. The same idea is one of the themes of Alfred F. Hurley in Billy Mitchell: Crusader for Air Power  (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 1964, 1975), viii, wherein he suggests that Mitchell was an important catalyst for progress in naval aviation.
