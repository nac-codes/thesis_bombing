army  that tactical and support aviation  remained the primary missions of the air force : “Participation in ground operations belongs to the fundamental missions of the air force. All of the operational capabilities can be utilized for this purpose.” 21 One of Cot ’s most interesting innovations was the creation of an experimental airborne force in 1937. The 175-man unit, called “air force infantry ,” participated in the Brittany maneuvers that year 22 and showed real promise before quickly disbanding when Cot  was replaced as aviation minister in 1938. By their very nature, airborne forces are offensive units. But the air force  had little support in the higher reaches of the dominant army  leadership for a program to create an offensive force and doctrine . Cot revised the French air force  rearmament plans in 1936 to ensure the creation of a modern, effective strategic force. Unlike his Plan I , Plan II  gave top priority to bomber production  (1,339 aircraft) and lowest priority to fighters  (756) and reconnaissance  planes (645). 23THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 156  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 184 --- Reforms of air force doctrine  and attempts to modernize the air force  made little impression upon either the thinking of the French army ’s senior officers or the operational doctrine  of the army. In dramatic contrast to British, German, and Soviet theorists  of mechanized warfare, French theorist Lt Col Charles de Gaulle  showed almost no interest in the role aviation could play in the ground battle . In his controversial book Vers l’Armée de Métier  (1934), de Gaulle  argued for a radical reformation of the French army  and creation of a seven-division armored force that would form the primary offensive striking power of the army  in wartime. Although he argued for giving tanks a central role in army doctrine, de Gaulle ’s few references to airpower dealt only with reconnaissance  and observation of artillery fire. 24 The revised French army operationa
