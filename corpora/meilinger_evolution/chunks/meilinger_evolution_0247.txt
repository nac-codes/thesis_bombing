officers reexamined fighter and bomber tactics and the use of attack aviation . The French air force  journal Revue de l’Armée de l’Air  published some of the best analysis of the Spanish air war. Neither the events of Spain  nor the desire of air force officers to reform air doctrine , however, had any considerable impact upon General Gamelin  or Air Minister LeChambre . An army -dominated High Command, largely and profoundly ignorant of the capabilities of modern airpower, frustrated France ’s last chance to develop an effective operational air doctrine .

In dozens of articles written in the 1920s and 1930s, he systematically refuted the theses of Douhet . For example, in contrast to Douhet ’s opposition to air reserve  forces, Mecozzi  stressed the importance of maintaining an air reserve  for employment during critica
