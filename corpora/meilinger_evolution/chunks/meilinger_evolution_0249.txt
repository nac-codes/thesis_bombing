under Balbo ’s direction, the Italian air force  organized tactical ground-attack units and practiced maneuvers based upon Mecozzi ’s ideas. 38 In 1931 the Italian air force  established its first ground-assault group under the command of Colonel Mecozzi .39 By 1935 the Italian Air Ministry  had developed and produced a heavy, single-engined assault aircraft—the Breda 65—with a 1,000 kg bombload, in accordance with Mecozzi ’s theories. 40 Mecozzi  opposed Douhet ’s concepts on moral and practical grounds. On moral grounds, he scathingly referred to Douhet ’s theories as “war against the unarmed.” On a practical level, Mecozzi  viewed Douhet ’s strategic bombing concepts as inappropriate to the kind of war that Italy  might have to fight. Balbo  seconded this view in an article on aerial warfare published in Encyclopaedia Italiana  in 1938. He argued that one could not apply Douhet ’s concepts in all circumstances, providing numerous examples, such as the colonial war in Ethiopia  and the war in Spain , which did not involve strategic bombing . Nevertheless, aviation had proven an important, even a decisive, weapon in the support role. 41 By the time of the Spanish Civil War  (1936–39), Mecozzi ’s ideas had largely won over Italian air force  officers. In Spain , the Italian air force  made a major contribution to the war and, in contrast to the Italian  ground forces, performed very credibly. In Spain  the air force  primarily provided interdiction bombing, close air support , and antishipping strikes. In all of these instances, it effectively supported the Italian and Nationalist ground troops. In addition to providing aircraft and training to the Nationalist air force , Italy  sent 5,699 air force personnel to Spain  and maintained an air force  contingent of 250 aircraft. Between 1936 and 1939, the Italians sent over 759 aircraft to Spain .42 The Italian air force , like the German , viewed Spain as a testing ground for doctrine  and technology , trying out its
