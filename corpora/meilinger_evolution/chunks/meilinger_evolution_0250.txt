Between 1936 and 1939, the Italians sent over 759 aircraft to Spain .42 The Italian air force , like the German , viewed Spain as a testing ground for doctrine  and technology , trying out its newest aircraft—the Breda 65  fighter-bomber and SM 79 bomber. 43 The Breda 65 also proved successful as a dive-bomber , further reinforcing the Italian preference for ground-attack aviation .44 The high point of Italian air operations in Spain  came in 1938, when Italian air force  units attacking en masse in direct support of motorized andCORUM 161  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 189 --- mechanized Nationalist  and Italian  army units, enabled the Nationalist army  to make rapid advances across the Republican Front to the Mediterranean , isolating Catalonia from the rest of the republic. 45 The only Douhetian-style strategic bombing  executed by the Italian air force  in the Spanish War  involved the bombing of Barcelona  in March 1938.
