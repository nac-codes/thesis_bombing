pain  the air force  had extensively practiced its primary operational doctrine , as advocated by Mecozzi , and had found it effective. The poor performance of the Italian air force  during World War II  resulted not from poor doctrine  but the incapacity of Italian industry to produce aircraft and engines that could match those of its opposing air forces, either in quantity or quality. Even if Italy  had made the air force its top priority and had poured all available resources into aviation, its financial and technological position still would have proved too weak to have maintained a first-rate air force  by World War II . Italy , whose best aircraft lacked modern radios, bombsights, and navigation equipment, provides an example of a nation whose strategic ambitions far outreached its fairly limited capabilities. Soviet Union In the interwar period, the Soviet Union  began with the weakest air force  and aviation industry of the major powers. From this disadvantageous position, the new Soviet UnionTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 162  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 190 --- built a large, relatively effective air force , almost from scratch. The Soviet military was partial to new ideas and concepts, including new ways of looking at aerial warfare. The two leading military theorists  of the new Soviet Union  in the interwar period were Gen Mikhail Frunze  (1885–1925) and Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevski  (1893–1937). Frunze  was a successful civil war commander who became a leading theorist of the Soviet military  after the civil war. A prolific writer, he advocated the creation of a highly mobile, professional army  equipped with the most modern weaponry. In January 1925, Frunze  became commissar for national defense, but later that year Joseph Stalin , fearing Frunze ’s popularity and prestige, had him assassinated. Frunze  argued consistently for the importance of the offense in warfare, and in his theory of the offense, airpower played a primary role. In an article
