Lapchinsky , who in 1920 wrote a book and series of articles outlining how strategic bombing  would become a major weapon of modern warfare. 57 In the early 1920s, at a time when the Soviets still flew a motley collection of obsolete aircraft left over from World War I  and the civil war, Lapchinsky  laid the theoretical groundwork for the creation ofTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 164  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 192 --- what would become the world’s largest strategic air force  by the early 1930s. The enthusiasm of Soviet air officers for strategic bombing in the 1920s resulted not so much from a rational analysis of the capabilities of airpower and aerial technology  than from a feeling that strategic bombing  was somehow more “modern.” One ought to link Bolshevism , the most “modern and scientific” of all ideologies, to the most up-to-date of all military methods—specifically strategic bombing . Contemporary German reports reflect part of the spirit of the time. In 1925 the German army , as part of a comprehensive program to develop the Soviet military, as well as build and test German weapons in the Soviet Union , provided experienced general staff officers to instruct in the Soviet staff colleges. Capt Martin Fiebig , an experienced pilot officer, served as the senior adviser and instructor at the Moscow Academy for Air Commanders  in 1925 and 1926. Part of his duties included organizing war games  for the Soviet air officers. Fiebig  criticized the Soviet officers’ conduct of the war games , specifically their preference for a strategic bombing campaign over army  support.

Fiebig  advised the Soviets to postpone strategic air campaigns until they reached a higher
