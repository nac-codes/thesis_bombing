n the development of Soviet air thought. Between 1936 and 1939, the Soviet Union  made a major commitment to the support of the Spanish Republic. The largest component of the Soviet commitment to Loyalist Spain  numbered almost one  thousand pilots and ground crews 62 and 909 aircraft. 63 In Spain , although aircraft attempted some bombing missions against cities in the early stages of the war, the primary focus of air operations on both sides took the form of army support  operations. In March 1937 Soviet aircraft and pilots flying for the Republic during the offensive at Guadalajara  won one of airpower’s most dramatic victories. Between 9 and 21 March 1937, Soviet airpower  attacked and pushed a force of 50,000 motorized Italian troops into a rout. Up to 125 Soviet-piloted, Loyalist aircraft attacked Italian columns in what we today would term a close interdiction  campaign. Italian casualties included five hundred killed in action, two thousand wounded, and five hundred taken prisoner. The Soviets destroyed an estimated one thousand vehicles and 25 artillery pieces. Air attack  inflicted most of the damage and casualties.64 The air campaign  at Guadalajara  in 1937 was the most decisive example of the use of airpower against ground forces in the interwar period, and the Soviets, following the Spanish experience, placed greater emphasis upon ground-attack tactics. Even General Lapchinsky , writing in 1939, came to emphasize the tactical and operational aspects of aviation over strategic air war : “In order to conduct maneuver war , to win the air-land battles , which begin in the air and end on theTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 166  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 194 --- ground, one must concentrate all air forces at a given time on a given front.” 65 Between 1938 and 1941, the Soviets went through several reorganizations. The large, independent bomber command , organized in the mid-1930s, was downgraded and reorganized in 1940. 66 Bomber forces split into small
