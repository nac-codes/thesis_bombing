a centralized command. In fact, in 1916 the air service  proposed that it become an independent branch of the armed forces, equal to the navy  and the army .68 The army General Staff strongly supported this proposal. Against strong navy  opposition, however, the idea foundered. Certain principles, nevertheless, were established at this time. For example, all aviation matters, from aircraft deployment and production to antiaircraft artillery  and civil defense, were centralized and placed under the control of the air service .69 In late 1916, the air service  acquired its own General Staff. The German air service  also enjoyed special prestige after the war. By the close of the campaign in 1918, the air service found itself the only sufficiently viable fighting force in theTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 168  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 196 --- German military  capable of mounting an effective resistance to the Allies. 70 By the end of the war, the strong performance and relative success of the German air service  in combat assured the concept of an equal and independent air force  within the German military . In fact, at the beginning of the Versailles Conference , Hans von Seeckt  proposed that Germany  be allowed a significant, independent air force .71 Even though the Versailles Treaty  forbade a German air force , consensus held that when rearmament came—and German officers believed that it would come again some day—Germany  would have an independent air force . This attitude gave the Germans an advantage in creating an airpower theory . Secure in the idea that the military accepted the idea of service independence, German airmen felt no compunctions about creating theories and doctrines  solely for the purpose of justifying service independence. A comprehensive examination of the wartime performance of the German air service  served as the first step in creating a modern air theory . Beginning in 1919, approximately 130 General Staff officers, air unit comm
