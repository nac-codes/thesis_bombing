examination of the wartime performance of the German air service  served as the first step in creating a modern air theory . Beginning in 1919, approximately 130 General Staff officers, air unit commanders , and technical experts began analyzing every aspect of Germany ’s performance in the air during the world war. Heading this effort was Lt Col Helmut Wilberg , who served as chief of the secret Air Staff of the army  from 1919 to 1927. 72 This thorough examination of airpower in 1919–20 formed the basis for an effective critique of the way Germany  had used airpower during the war and the way it ought to use it in the future. The first principle derived from the postwar critique maintained that Germany  had made a major mistake in fighting with a defensive air strategy  during World War I . For most of the war, the Germans had fought a defensive air war, waiting for Allied pilots to cross their lines and then engaging them. Although this approach brought relative success and a kill ratio of approximately three to one over Allied pilots, the Allies nevertheless gained the initiative and then maintained air superiority  over the battle areas. 73 By 1920 German airmen had established the principle that airpower was intrinsically offensive and that the first duty of the air force in war was to aggressively seek out and win airCORUM 169  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 197 --- superiority . Air forces would attain air superiority  primarily by attacking the enemy air force on the ground, in its air bases. Army Regulation 487, Leadership and Battle with Combined Arms  (1921), expressed the new doctrine  in strong terms: “From the beginning [of the war] our forces will strive for air supremacy . . . . The battle for air superiority  is an offensive one. The enemy’s aviation is to be sought out and attacked forward of his own troops. The opponent is to be pushed onto the defensive, and his power and aggressiveness broken by the destruction of numerous aircraft
