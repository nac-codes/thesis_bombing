of providing the necessary range and performance. Faced with technological limitations, as well as the greater difficulty and cost of building large aircraft, the Germans gave the heavy bomber project a low priority for development. 85 Because of the availability of technology  to provide a force of modern medium bombers , dive-bombers , fighter  aircraft, and reconnaissance planes, the German air force  in the mid- to late 1930s developed as an interdiction  and tactical support force, rather than a long-range strategic force. In 1934 General Wever  directed the writing of the primary German air doctrine  of World War II , with Helmut Wilberg heading the committee. Luftwaffe Regulation 16, Conduct of the Air War  (1935), provided a more balanced view of airpower than the 1926 regulation. 86 Although the regulation still gave precedence to strategic bombing  as a primary mission, it remained more cautious about the ability of strategic bombers to damage civilian morale . In fact, the doctrine  of 1935 argued against bombing  cities in order to attack civilian populations on the grounds that, first, it was immoral and, second, it was likely to backfire and provide the opposite effect, strengthening civilian resistance and morale  rather than weakening them.87 Germans remember General Wever , who died in an air crash in 1936, for his advocacy of strategic bombing , but his vision of airpower was far more comprehensive. For example, he gave the development of close air support  aircraft, particularly the training of liaison teams to cooperate with the army  for air support, a high priority in 1936.88 Wever  also oversaw the creation of a paratroop force  that would soon become the largest and most effective airborne force in the world. First used in the maneuvers of 1937 and 1938, German paratroops  greatly enhanced their reputation by successfully seizing objectives behind enemy lines. 89CORUM 173  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 201 --- Because Nazi ideolo
