undamental changes in German airpower theory  or doctrine . Methods of close air support  were perfected during the Spanish War , in which close air support  remained a primary mission of the air force. Dive-bombing , in development since the late 1920s, was effective, but morale bombing  of civilians, as tried by both sides in the early days of the war and as the Germans predicted, was not. By the eve of World War II , the German military had generally succeeded in translating airpower theory  into effective doctrine  and tactics for the use of airpower. The German air force  of 1939 was well organized into effective tactical air fleets that could carry out both strategic and tactical missions. The Luftwaffe  comprised a bomber-heavyTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 174  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 202 --- force, envisioned since the first days after World War I  and capable of carrying out a wide variety of missions, from long-range bombing  to close air support  to the operational use of paratroops . As the war commenced, however, some serious failings in German airpower theory  and doctrine  came to light. First, enthusiasm for the technique of dive-bombing  set the development of German bomber technology  back several years. Gen Ernst Udet , who took over air force technical development in 1936, insisted that in the future, all bombers be designed as dive-bombers . This necessitated the redesign of excellent aircraft like the Ju-88  and resulted in production delays. 92 Second, the German air force  and navy  failed to create an effective naval air doctrine  in the interwar period. When the war commenced, the naval air arm had no modern aircraft capable of long-range antishipping strikes or torpedo attacks, a major failing in the war against England . One can characterize German interwar airpower theory  as comprehensive, practical, and well adapted to German strategy and technology . The greatest failings in translating airpower theory  into doctrine  for an
