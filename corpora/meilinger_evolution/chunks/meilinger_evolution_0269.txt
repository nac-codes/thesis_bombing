ll halfway between the two positions. Generally, the most important participants in the debate were within the armed forces. Douhet ’s influence waned quickly after he left the Air Ministry  in the early 1920s. Pierre Cot  wrote and spoke often on airpower before and after his tenure as air minister but had little impact outside of office. Professional German airmen explicitly rejected the Nazi view of air war  as expressed by Ludendorff  in the 1930s. For the most part, the decision to accept the view of the air force  primarily as a support force came from within the officer corps of the air forces. Italy , the Soviet Union , and Germany  allowed considerable free debate on theory and doctrine within the air force. Only France discouraged debate on fundamental military theory. Each major air power faced unique conditions and requirements in the process of translating theory  into doctrine . The Germans managed the process most effectively, primarily due to the tradition of the General Staff. They based their theory and doctrine  upon a thorough analysis of the use of airpower in World War I  and of airpower developments in other countries. Further, they objectively tested their ideas in war games  and maneuvers. The French, on the other hand, managed the process least effectively, also due to their General Staff tradition. Whereas the Germans tolerated debate among General Staff officers and regarded that body as a collective organization, the French saw the staff primarily as assistants to the commander in chief and considered the army commander’s vision the foundation of theory and doctrine . The three French army commanders of the interwar period— Petain , Weygand , and Gamelin —had little interest in the air force ; consequently, doctrine  suffered. Germany , the Soviet Union , and Italy  were able to test their respective airpower theories and doctrines  as the primary air combatants in SpainTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 176  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page
