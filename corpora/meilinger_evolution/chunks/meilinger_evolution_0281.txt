ndependent strategic bombardment against the vital centers  of an enemy state. To resolve the above questions favorably and to ensure that American airpower  realized its full potential, early air leaders and thinkers such as Mitchell , Patrick , Gorrell , Milling , Sherman , Benjamin “Benny” Foulois , and Henry “Hap” Arnold haltingly developed an ad hoc, four-part strategy designed either to create new roles and missions for the Air Corps  or to steal old responsibilities away from the Army  and Navy . Specifically, the strategy sought to (1) redefine America as an airpower rather than a maritime nation; (2) demonstrate and publicize the versatility of airpower in peacetime roles; (3) create both a corporate Air Corps  identity through political maneuvering and an independent air force  through legislation; and (4) perhaps most importantly, develop a unique theory of air warfare —unescorted high-altitude precision daylight bombardment (HAPDB)  against the key nodes of an enemy’s industrial infrastructure. (The development of air theory and doctrine  became the special responsibility of the Air Service Field Officer’s School [ASFOS , 1920–21], which the Army  laterTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 186  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 213 --- rechristened the Air Service Tactical School [ASTS , 1922–26], and then the seminal Air Corps Tactical School [ACTS , 1926–40]. The school divided its 20-year existence between Langley Field, Virginia , and Maxwell Field, Alabama , where it moved in 1931.)15 The airmen’s four-part strategy ultimately worked. Not only did the Air Service  survive as an institution but thanks to ACTS ’s infamous “Bomber Mafia ” and their sympathizers, the Army ’s semiautonomous air arm entered World War II  with the necessary organization, the specific bomber , and the unique theory/doctrine ultimately used to conduct the most devastating strategic air campaign  in history. To explain how this happened, this chapter explores how the first three compo
