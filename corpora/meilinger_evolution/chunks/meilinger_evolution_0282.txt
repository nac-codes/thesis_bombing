To explain how this happened, this chapter explores how the first three components of the Air Corps ’s ad hoc strategy helped it survive and then flourish as an interwar institution. In other words, the chapter broadly (and impressionistically) reviews how zealous airmen partially succeeded in promoting America as an airpower rather than a maritime nation, in demonstrating and publicizing the versatility of airpower  in peacetime roles, and in advocating an increasingly independent air force  through political maneuvering and legislation. Last, the chapter focuses on the seminal role of ACTS  in the development of a unique theory and doctrine  of American airpower. In particular, it looks at ACTS ’s three distinct theoretical/doctrinal phases and the way they led to Air War Plans Division, Plan 1 (AWPD-1) , America ’s first substantive plan for strategic air warfare .16 America: An Airpower or a Maritime Nation? Although the United States  has historically defined itself as a maritime power, Army  airmen like Hap Arnold  and Ira Eaker argued otherwise throughout the interwar years.
