er advocate Earl “Pat” Partridge , for example, taught himself to type by repeatedly transcribing Winged Warfare,  William Bishop ’s inspirational recollection of his experiences as a fighter ace in World War I .19 Walter “Buck”  Weaver, a “hard disciplinarian” who first commanded Maxwell Field  (1927–31) and then ACTS  itself (1939–40), invented “Chess Air ,” a three-dimensional chess game with the top board made up exclusively of aircraft pieces. 20 Further, at the Primary Flying School  in San Antonio, Texas, one particularly zealous monitor required the “Dodos” (pilot trainees) at his breakfast table to wear goggles on the mornings they ate grapefruits and, when they later performed their appointed rounds, to bank all turns made while walking (obviously, by holding their arms straight out from their sides and leaning in the direction of the turn). 21 In the public sphere, attempts to promote air-mindedness were often as silly, but they became more clearheaded with time. In one especially fertile (yet ambiguous) attempt to connect Americanism, Babe Ruth, and airpower, the “Sultan of Swat” tried to catch three baseballs dropped from an aircraft circling 250 feet overhead. The first two balls knocked Ruth flat on his back, but on the third try he did manage to catch the ball. 22 In contrast, the motive behind the 1920 “bombing” of the Alamo Plaza by Air Service  D.H.4Bs  was less opaque. The Air Service  clearly equated Army aviation  with Americanism by “bombing” the people below with recruiting literature.23 The air arm’s innumerable flying exhibits for county fairs (and even picnics) further promoted air- mindedness  in the public, as did Claire Chennault ’s Three Men on a Flying Trapeze—the Air Corps ’s first aerial demonstration team—and Jimmy Doolittle ’s repeated victories in highly visible national air races. (Much to the annoyance of the Navy , Doolittle  won the 1925 Schneider Cup, a race reserved exclusively for seaplanes !)24 However, media-savvy vision
