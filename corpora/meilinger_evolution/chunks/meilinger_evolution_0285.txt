d improved air arm; and he dramatized “values, attitudes, and behaviors” that arguably defined, along with the Ted Scott  series and dozens of other aviation-related examples, the “national character” of an entire generation of interwar youth. 28 Among its other qualities, that confident character certainly emphasized duty before self, particularly in a professional Air Corps  that fulfilled America ’s military needs first and foremost through the air. In the 1930s Oscar Westover , who served as chief of the Air Corps  from 1935 to 1938, joined Arnold  and Eaker  in trying to turn even more of America ’s youth into “airheads,” as one wag put it. 29 In particular, they focused their attention on the Junior Birdmen of America  (organized in 1932), the Jimmie Allen Flying Club , and several other boys’ aeronautic organizations. (In 1936 the Junior Birdmen of America  alone had 17 wings and close to five hundred thousand members.) 30 From General Westover ’s perspective, the members of these organizations fulfilled two needs—they acted as coworkers in aFABER 189  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 216 --- common, air-centered cause and they provided a future reserve of flying strength for America . (In the last case, Westover thought it “thrilling” that Junior Birdmen would soon fly state-of-the-art four-engined aircraft.) 31 Arnold  and Eaker , in turn, had an additional hope for America ’s young aeromaniacs, and they expressed it in the dedication of a proposed book (Flying and Your Boy) —“May they grasp the controls with firm hands and . . . stout hearts to the end that America  may lead the world in the air.” 32 In other words, the goal of America  was not only to become an airpower nation but—through its youth—to dominate the sky. (The Air Corps  strove to promote both goals in myriad ways. In one example, it hosted a national Junior Birdmen event in a balloon hangar at Brooks Field, Texas , and then provided the attendees tours of Randolph Field , home of
