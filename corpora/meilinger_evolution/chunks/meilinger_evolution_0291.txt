erior naval forces . . . seek a decisive naval engagement in the vicinity of the Panama Canal . . . . Such actions draw the U.S. Navy  to Caribbean waters, with its naval aviation . Land forces from the Orient, using Alaska as an advanced base, seek . . . to establish a salient in the area Washington, Oregon, California and inland to about Salt Lake City, as a land base for further offensive operations in U.S. territory. The concentration of the U.S. Army  with its aviation,  in the western theatre of operations would be mandatory to resist the land invasion. Simultaneously, the mass of the Allied air forces have been flown, or shipped under submarine and patrol boat convoy, from Ireland to Newfoundland and are prepared to launch air attacks, from air bases in eastern Canada, against any targets of their choice in the vital industrial heart of our country. (Emphasis in original) 45 The targets of choice, according to Capt Harold Lee  George— doyen of the ACTS  Bomber Mafia —would be rail lines, refineries, electric power systems, and (as a last resort) water supply systems. By attacking and destroying these objectives, George  argued, an invader would quickly and efficiently destroy the people’s will  to resist—the key to success in modern war. 46 George ’s emphasis on attacking will was thoroughly Clausewitzian and familiar. As a pedagogical concept, it appeared in Influence of Airplanes on Operations in War,  a text first used at the Field Officer’s School  in 1920–21. The text argued that war was “a conflict of human wills, bent and twisted in the heat of violent emotions”; that aircraft had a “peculiarly demoralizing influence” on any contest between moral forces; and that material factors in war (and therefore targets) only mattered to the extent that they modified an opponent’s will to resist .47 (The text’s logic was obviously deductive, as was the Bomber Mafia ’s. Robert Webster , for example, opined the following about human will and endurance: “There must
