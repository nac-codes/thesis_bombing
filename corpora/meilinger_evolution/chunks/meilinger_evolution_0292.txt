Robert Webster , for example, opined the following about human will and endurance: “There must be some limit to this endurance; it is not reasonable that a nation can see every resource that it has for waging war destroyed without realizing the folly of continued opposition.”) 48THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 194  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 221 --- If America ’s industrial triangle  were the ultimate, war- winning target of an invading force, regardless of how vaguely defined, what role did the Navy  have in continental defense?

Perhaps Thomas Milling  stated the early Air Corps  position best when he noted that “it needs no great stretch of the imagination to foresee the time when sea supremacy will rest entirely in air power.” 49 Such revisionism partially had its roots in the Preparedness Movement  of World War I , which the Washington Herald  deftly summarized in a later byline as “Training Is Good.
