policy on the relationship between Army  and Navy aircraft. The ASTS  commandant, Maj Oscar Westover , protested innocently that the intent of the school was not to preach or even suggest who should have particular roles and missions . But he also noted that the growth of aviation had brought about an appreciation of what air forces could do and thus required a “consideration of realignment of the real agencies making for National Defense .”63 Given this Janus-faced sentiment, it is not surprising that the suggested ASTS  changes to GO 20 deliberately sought to blur the geographical areas of responsibility between naval  and land-based aviation .64 Air Corps  leaders subsequently stressed this ambiguity and increasingly demanded that land-based aviation  should operate from America ’s shoreline up to six hundred miles at sea, depending on the source. The demands, regardless of how vaguely made, spurred Gen Douglas MacArthur  and Adm William V. Pratt , as heads of their respective services, to reach a temporary agreement onTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 198  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 225 --- coastal defense  in 1931. They seemingly agreed that naval air forces would exclusively support forces afloat and therefore enjoy complete freedom of action, while the Army Air Corps would defend the coasts of the United States  and its overseas possessions. In reality, the agreement was sufficiently vague that the Navy  interpreted the arrangement more broadly than the Army  did. As a result, the Navy  continued to expand land-based naval facilities and develop scout bombers .65 The upstart Air Corps ’s response was twofold. First, it repeated Milling ’s previous, topsy-turvy complaints: it was the Navy , by stealing away precious funds for itself, that was imperiling the creation of a proper air force for national defense ; it was the Navy  that was encroaching on the “prerogatives and proper duties” of the Air Corps ; and it was the Navy  that was neglecting its own role
