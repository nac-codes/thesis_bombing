the Navy ’s domain was not attributable to mutual cooperation or concessions to its complaints. Instead, it was attributable to the Air Corps ’s ability to provide a clearly stated alternative to sea-based national defense , which then attracted the support of a very powerful friend—President Franklin D. Roosevelt . But who specifically provided the Air Corps ’s blueprint for national defense  in the mid- to late-1930s? Not surprisingly, it was ACTS  and the Air Corps Board (ACB) , a group resurrected by the Baker Board  in 1935.69 From 1935 to 1940, the revitalized ACB  worked side by side with ACTS  at Maxwell Field . Its members usually included the ACTS  commandant and assistant commandant as ex officio members; a director of the board, who was usually its senior permanent member (Col Douglas B. Netherwood , Lt Col Edgar B. Sorensen , and Col Robert Kauch , for example); and five to eight officers and civilians who had an almost incestuous working relationship with ACTS . In the last case, bomber proponent Laurence Kuter  recalled that “the school thought it could get some things through the chief’s office via the board that it couldn’t any other way [and that] the board was quite happy to have that arrangement too.” 70 As a result of this close association, for several years ACTS  formally scrubbed all ACB  reports that went to the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps (OCAC) ; the board ensured that its studies were compatible with the principles taught at the Tactical School ; and the mutual cooperation between both organizations ensured that they spoke with one voice, especially when they developed the theoretical and doctrinal “language” that the Air Corps increasingly used to claim a role in offshore defense. In developing the above “language,” the ACB  fulfilled a charter that was both theoretical and practical. On the theoretical level, its role was to study Air Corps  problems and issues that involved considerable study and research, as assigned by the
