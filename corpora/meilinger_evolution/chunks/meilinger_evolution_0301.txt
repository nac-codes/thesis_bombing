The purpose of ACB-31 was to “determine the manner in which Air Forces may best perform those functions for which they are, or should be , responsible” (emphasis added). 76 The report, although endorsed by ACTS , was sufficiently controversial that OCAC  classified it Confidential and did not formally approve it until 29 October 1936. (The office copy, for example, has warnings such as “not to leave the office” and “do not forward” scrawled and underlined on the title page.) 77 Six weeks later, on 11 December 1936, General Westover recommended that the War Department  adopt ACB-31 as its official air policy. Not surprisingly, his recommendation went unheeded. The report, although circumspect, challenged the orthodoxy of the time. It conceded that the primary role of Army Air Forces (AAF)  was to defend US territory, preserve internalFABER 201  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 228 --- order, and support ground  and naval forces .78 However, since airpower  was inherently strategic, it also insisted that the Air Corps  develop, operate, and maintain follow-on air forces for defensive and possibly offensive strategic operations. 79 (Why?

The suggested targets included but were not limited to troop cantonments or concentrations, choke points in lines of communications , enemy air forces and naval vessels, fuel storage plants, power grids, munitions and aircraft factories, and assorted types of refineries. 81 Last, ACB-31’s definition of air-based coastal defense  was also premeditatedly va
