ing development.” 84 In other words, the role of airpower was not just supplementary—to attack hostile forces beyond the reach of the Army  or Navy —but to strike directly against an enemy nation! Its ultimate responsibility was to exert the greatest possible influence on the outcome of the entire campaign, rather than [be] diverted for the purpose of meeting some immediate emergency of lesser ultimate importance. Aircraft should never be used against targets appropriate for and within the range of other weapons unless there are no other objectives suitable for air attack  or the situation demands the concentration of all available weapons. 85 Therefore, to support the Monroe Doctrine  properly, AAF needed to perform most of its missions over areas that were potentially far beyond the operating radius of the Army  and Navy . Yes, the Air Corps  had an auxiliary, defensive role, but in the name of strategic defense, it was incumbent for the GHQ Air Force  to operate under the most favorable circumstances possible, which meant using bombers  to the fullest extent of their ability and where the opponent was most vulnerable to attack.86 The old areas of responsibility worked out by the Joint Board  and MacArthur-Pratt  no longer applied. An opponent’s most vital targets might now include land forces, large naval expeditions, or the structure of an enemy nation. 87 However, in order to provide long-range defense and more, ACB-35 insisted that the B-17  make up at least one-third of the Air Corps ’s bomber force and thus enable it to operate as far as fifteen hundred miles out at sea or from a particular base. Hap Arnold  and others subsequently used this well-developed paradigm to encroach on the long-range “defense” mission traditionally dominated by the Navy . They acted upon the ACB ’s recommendations, but the level of success they experienced against the Navy  in the mid- to late-1930s might not have occurred without a powerful new ally—Franklin D. Roosevelt .88 FDR
