rwar years, whether civilian or military, Army  traditionalists sought to thwart them at every turn. Col Benjamin Foulois , for example, complained to the Morrow Board  in 1925 that a fair, just, willing and sympathetic opportunity for the Air Service  to produce results has never been evidenced, from my experience of the past 17 years, and I doubt whether results can be obtained in the next 20 years if the Air Service  is required to continue its struggle for existence under General Staff control. 90 What was the reason for such hostility? Maj Gen Mason Patrick , while head of the Air Service , argued politely that in the case of the Army , its leaders were hidebound Neanderthals who did not realize the full potential of airpower and therefore took three years to acknowledge they even had an Air Service .91 In turn, Robert Bullard  claimed that the directors ofTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 204  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 231 --- the older services were “jealously intent upon keeping this new [aviation] arm subordinate, as an auxiliary, lest they lose power and prestige.” 92 And so the explanations and complaints continued well into the 1930s, when an anonymous airman refused to share credit or take comfort in the great strides made by Army aviation : “Although the Air Corps  has escaped from its role as [the] Cinderella of the Army , it has done so through its own effort alone and is still subject to the might of its none too appreciative parents.” 93 These “parents” were, in Hanson Baldwin ’s words, “short-sighted old fogies.” They included the long-suffering Maj Gen Hugh Drum , whom the “dervishes of airpower” attacked repeatedly as a thick-witted Army  traditionalist who refused to abandon his early claim that the American doughboy would forever remain the decisive element in war. 94 Were Army  airmen always right to fear their parent organization? Was the interwar Army  unremittingly hostile towards its own air arm? The answer to both questions is “no,” b
