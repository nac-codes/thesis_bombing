d the primacy of the bomber  and developed its core principles of employment. From 1927 to 1934, the Bomber Mafia  developed a uniquely American way of air warfare —unescorted HAPDB  against the key nodes of an enemy’s industrial-economic infrastructure. Last, from roughly 1935 to 1940, faculty members not only formalized their theory into doctrine  but also sought to identify what particular target sets  constituted the key vulnerabilities of an enemy’s industrial-economic system. Before one reviews these three rough-hewn phases, however, it is appropriate to provide a brief statistical portrait of ACTS . Between 1921–40, 1,091 officers graduated from ASFOS / ASTS /ACTS . The average officer was 39 years old, had 17 years of service, and had consistently received nothing less than ratings of “excellent” in previous efficiency reports. Ninety percent of the students were airmen, while the remaining 10 percent came from the other services or branches of the Army . Captains comprised the majority of the attendees (55 percent), while 29 percent were majors. (Thirty-four percent of the graduates then attended Army Command and General Staff College  at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas .) Ten percent came from other services or branches of the Army . Most importantly, however, only 15 percent graduated from 1921 to 1930, when the school remained relatively unsophisticated. In contrast, 65 percent of theFABER 211  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 238 --- students attended the school from 1936 to 1940, when it taught a mature, well-established version of HAPDB . Further, of the 1,091 total graduates, 261 of them became general officers in World War II . They comprised 80 percent of the senior leadership in AAF  and included 11 out of 13 three-star generals and all three of the four-star generals then in service. 119 The point is obvious—an overwhelming number of wartime Air Force  leaders attended ACTS  in the interwar years, and a significant number of them were systemat
