variety of sources, the majority of the early materials were Army -centered and trivialized the possible impact of air bombardment. Air Service  information circulars 56, 57, 73, 75, 84, and 87—all of which functioned as early texts for the attack, bombardment, observation, and pursuit portions of what soon developed into a 10-month course—certainly emphasized the importance of traditional ground forces  and the auxiliary nature of airpower. So did another conciliatory ASTS  text, Billy Mitchell ’s Notes on the Multi-Motored Bombardment Group, Day and Night, which became an official Air Service  publication in 1922 and which primarily stressed the role of bombardment in the immediate battle zone.FABER 213  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 240 --- Following that was Training Regulation 440-15, Air Tactics, which William Sherman  largely wrote in 1922 and the War Department  did not accept as official Army doctrine  until January 1926. It argued that the general roles of airpower included observation, artillery control, and transportation. The specific role of bombardment, in contrast, remained the interdiction  of hostile land forces and targets deep in the enemy’s “zone of the interior.” 124 Subsequently, the ASTS Bombardment  text of 1924–25 made a similar argument. Bomber aircraft  were nothing more than large-caliber guns that could outrange and outstrike other types of guns and thus harass approaching infantry columns or disrupt the concentration of troops. 125 Last, the 1926 version of the Bombardment  text continued to accept the largely auxiliary nature of airpower by advocating air strikes against the “spouts” of an army’s supplies. 126 All of the above texts provided a foundation for the rough-hewn ASFOS /ASTS  curriculum, but they did not ultimately stray from Army  orthodoxy. They agreed that workable principles of strategic airpower  were still few and far between and that pursuit aviation , since it was responsible for the necessary first step
