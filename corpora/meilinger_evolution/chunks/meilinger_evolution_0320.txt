Decisive attacks, in contrast, will spur the collapse of a society’s vital centers  and thus lead to the destruction of society as a whole. That Milling  supported the above assumptions depends on strong conjecture rather than direct evidence. However, in the case of Sherman , the above views are clearly documented in Air Warfare,  which appeared in 1926 and was the culmination of Sherman ’s work at the Tactical  School. In the book, he echoes the Combined Air Force  text in the following ways: enemy morale is the center of gravity  in air warfare ; one should put enemy population centers, supply systems, and other rearward objectives under pressure in an effort to paralyze an entire society; a vigorous aerial assault is appropriate since no one can wholly prevent a hostile air assault; the very nature of bombardment aircraft makes them a strategic weapon; and the skillful air leader should economize his strength “at all points to the point of parsimony, in order that he may spend with a prodigal hand at the all-important time and place.” 130 The above propositions illustrate a huge point: from 1920 to 1926, ASFOS /ASTS  did not develop a specific, universally accepted doctrine for the Army Air Service . What it did do, however, was elevate the importance of the bomber  and formalize a series of bedrock principles or working propositions that provided a foundation for the second great contribution of ACTS —the development from roughly 1927 to 1935 of unescorted HAPDB , a specific and unique air doctrine . ACTS Phase Two (1927–34) ACTS ’s Bomber Mafia  developed HAPDB . The zealous faculty members of this group (and their dates of assignment to the school) included Robert Olds  (1928–31), Kenneth Walker  (1929–33), Donald Wilson  (1929–34, 1936–40), Harold Lee George  (1932–36), Odas Moon  (1933–36), Robert Webster (1934–37),
