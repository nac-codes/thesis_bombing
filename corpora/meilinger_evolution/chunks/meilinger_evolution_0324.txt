An inviolable principle of ACTS  was that airmen use the bomber  only against vital material targets located deep within hostile territory and that it never serve in harassing operations for the Army .140 ACTS Phase Three (1935–40) Although Donald Wilson  tried to delve into strategic targeting  as early as 1932–33, the work of Robert Webster  and Muir Fairchild  in the mid- to late-1930s identified the industrial  and economic target sets  that still define modern war. As far as the bomber advocates were concerned, unescorted HAPDB  would destroy an opponent’s will to resist only if it focused on destroying or paralyzing “national organic systems  on which many factories and numerous people depended” (emphasis in original). 141 These systems included electrical power generation and distribution, since virtually all industrial and economic operations depended on them; transportation networks (railroads in particular); fuel refining and distribution processes; food distribution and preservation methods; steel manufacturing, which defined a state’s war-making potential; and a system of highly concentrated manufacturing plants, including those that produced electrical generators, transformers, and motors. 142 The above approach was nothing more than an economy-of- force doctrine  predicated on subjective analyses of the US economy. 143 It was best suited for the denial of war materials to a highly industrialized enemy whose industries and population were concentrated together. 144 Unfortunately—and despite the genuine belief by bomber enthusiasts that the Air Corps  had the minimum skills and technology  needed to meet the above targeting requirements—the strategic intelligence  on which proper targeting depended was still an infant art. A priori knowledge of what constituted a legitimate target set  for a given nation involved considerable guesswork and remained unreliable. As a result, immediately before and during World War II , Allied targeting
