dge of what constituted a legitimate target set  for a given nation involved considerable guesswork and remained unreliable. As a result, immediately before and during World War II , Allied targeting groups constantly revised their target lists, either elevating or demoting particular target sets  based on the sketchy strategic intelligence  then available. (The two wartime cases that best illustrate the problem involve ballFABER 219  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 246 --- bearings and electricity. In the first case, Allied planners overestimated the importance of ball bearings to the German war economy and thus wasted a considerable amount of resources against perhaps a second-tier target. In the second case, although ACTS  identified electricity as the organic essential of modern industrialized states, the Allies never mounted an air campaign  against German electricity. Other, more immediate, problems seemed always to take precedence.) Was the Bomber Mafia ’s theory flawed? Of course! (1) It assumed, in good Progressivist  fashion, that one could scientifically manage war. Like almost all the other American theories of airpower that followed, the ACTS  theory of unescorted HAPDB  was part of a cause-and-effect universe where one’s external means directly impacted another’s internal behaviors. Unescorted HAPDB , therefore, was too mechanistic and prescriptive for its own good. It wrongly assumed that one could impose precise, positive controls over complex events. (2) The theory was suspect because of its mid-Victorian faith in technology . It wrongly assumed that revolutionary bomber-related technologies would produce almost “frictionless” wars, regardless of pesky variables such as weather. The “dervishes of airpower,” in other words, saw technology  as a panacea. (3) The theory failed to acknowledge properly that armed conflict was, as Clausewitz  rightfully pointed out, an interactive process between at least two competing wills—not the imposition
