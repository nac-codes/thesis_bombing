a panacea. (3) The theory failed to acknowledge properly that armed conflict was, as Clausewitz  rightfully pointed out, an interactive process between at least two competing wills—not the imposition of one’s own will against a passive foe. As the North Vietnamese demonstrated repeatedly in the Second Indochina War , people subjected to air attacks can substitute for and work around lost capabilities. In short, they can react. (4) Unescorted HAPDB  overemphasized the offensive aspects of air warfare , like all other significant airpower theories, while minimizing the mischievous potential of defensive strategies and technologies. The theory did not properly anticipate the elaborate, radar-based fighter-AAA defense  networks that appeared in World War II . Therefore, in what turned out to be an egregious error, the Bomber Mafia ’s belief that massed bomber  formations could penetrate enemy air defenses  without fighter escorts  and still destroy selected targets with acceptable losses was dead wrong. Eighth AirTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 220  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 247 --- Force  had to fight its way into Germany  past intervening defenses, just like virtually all other invaders had done over the last five thousand years. To reach the vital centers  of Germany , Allied airpower had to attrit the Luftwaffe  from the sky—and needed long-range fighters (P-51 Mustangs and P-47 Thunderbolts ) to do it. (5) It overstressed the psychological  impact of physical destruction and merely assumed that the terrors inherent in bombardment would eventually destroy an enemy’s will to resist . Arguably, World War II  proved otherwise. (6) HAPDB  repeatedly (and wrongly) used metaphors to imply that modern industrial states, with their “organic essentials,” were brittle and closed socioeconomic systems—not the adaptable and open systems that they typically were, for example, in World War II. (7) The theory wrongly assumed that opposing states were rational, unitary actors
