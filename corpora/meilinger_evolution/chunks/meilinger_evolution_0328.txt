ral public, sympathetic “fellow travelers,” members of Congress , and ACTS  (in all its guises), it secured a semiautonomous strike force—GHQ Air Force ; it had a shared (yet still ambiguous) responsibility with the Navy  for hemispheric defense; and it had a strategic air doctrine  that stressed independent air operations—not against enemy armies but against the core vulnerabilities of an opposing nation’s economic infrastructure. In closing, however, one must answer one final question. Did the people at ACTS  and in the field completely surrender to the new orthodoxy of HAPDB ? Did everyone succumb to the vision of unescorted battle planes  making protracted warfare a thing of the past? In fact, archival evidence shows that even up to the last days before the outbreak of war, both students and members of the Air Corps  at large exhibited either ignorance about or resistance to the soothing answers found in the theory of unescorted strategic bombardment. To cite one representative example from ACTS , Gen Orvel Cook , who was a student in 1937–38, remembered that audiences were highly skeptical of the school’s bombardment doctrine : “Some of us had had more experience than some of the instructors and, consequently, we took a lot of this instruction with a large grain of salt, and we more or less made up our minds as to what [to believe], no matter how dogmatic the instructor might be.” 146 Cook  went on to note that the students had as many different points of view as the instructors: “We knew they were sort of talking off the top of their heads.
