ton, D.C. Although Flying and Your Boy  never appeared (as conceived) in print, Arnold and Eaker’s This Flying Game  (1936) included a dedication to the Junior Birdmen of America and the Jimmie Allen Flying Club. 33. See AFHRA, file no. 168.7023-4. 34. Quoted by Oscar Westover in “Military Aviation,” speech to the Aero Club of America, Buffalo, N.Y., 7 December 1932, 16, AFHRA, file no. 168.7103-26. 35. General Pershing, who appointed the “tough but fair” Patrick, expected his West Point classmate to muzzle the garrulous and therefore subversive Mitchell. Patrick was only partially successful. However, as a respected moderate who often (but carefully) sided with his subordinates against the “old guard,” he provided the Air Service with something it sorely needed—credibility. Also, it probably helped that Patrick was physically unprepossessing; his false teeth whistled when he spoke and he wore a toupee, which one unfortunate captain once pulled off while helping him remove his flight helmet.

To further illustrate the value of airborne fire patrols, Secretary of War John Weeks claimed that wildfires in California increased by 23 percent when the Air Service did not provide airplanes for forest protection in 1922.
