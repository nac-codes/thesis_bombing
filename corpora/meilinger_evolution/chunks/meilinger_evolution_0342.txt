If the Navy was the spearhead, the Army was the bulwark—or so Milling further argued. In reality, this “bulwark” remained porous, at least against attacking aircraft. By 1936 the Army’s Coast Artillery Corps still relied on sightless machine guns, three-inch guns, and 105 mm pieces that fired 62-pound shells. In the case of aerial defense, the normal mission was to concentrate fire on aircraft not attacking defense batteries! Even then, the batterymen had trouble properly aiming and firing their three-inch guns six hundred yards ahead of their intended targets (to establish a killing zone for oncoming aircraft). See Maj Gen A. H. Sunderland, “The Coast Artillery Corps,” lecture given at the Army War College, 9 October 1936, AFHRA, file no. 168.7001-37. 56. Wilson, 8, 9 (Walker section). In his testimony, Walker cleverly used the writings and lectures of Navy officers against their own service. 57. Ibid., 7 (Webster section). 58. Ibid., 6–8. 59. The Navy’s reaction is beyond the scope of this chapter, but Josephus Daniels’s huffy response to the dangers posed by land-based aviation to modern fleets was highly representative. According to Daniels, no air force would get close enough “to drop salt upon the tail of the Navy.” See New York Tribune,  8 February 1921, 1. 60. Quoted in Westover, “Military Aviation,” 9. However, did Coolidge envision a robust national defense? One should not forget the frugal president’s comment to Secretary of War John M. Weeks—“What’s all this talk about lots of airplanes? Why not buy one airplane and let the Army pilots take turns flying it?” See Foulois, 199. 61. Lt Gen Robert L. Bullard, “Army
