, AFHRA, file no. 248.211-65. 68. In 1938 insult followed injury, or so air zealots thought. After three B-17s intercepted the Rex (an Italian ocean liner) over seven hundred miles east of New York, the Navy temporarily succeeded in restricting Air Corps aircraft to a 100-mile zone off the coast. The lead navigator of the B-17s was Capt Curtis LeMay. 69. The Baker Board’s recommendation was explicit: “To assist in correcting the present unsatisfactory condition of unit training, the committee recommends the early creation of the Air Corps Board and that when created this board give prompt attention to the formulation of uniform tactical doctrines for all types of aircraft units.” Quoted in Lt Col W. C. McChord, chief of the Air Corps Plans Division, memorandum to acting chief of the Air Corps, 29 November 1935, 1, AFHRA, file no. 167.5 (1935–1936). 70. Gen Laurence S.

In this respect, the ACB’s charter paralleled those of other branch-specific boards, including the Infantry Board, the Coast Artillery Board, and the Chemical Warfare Service Board.

The provisions of the regulation subsequently remained in effect, but the board accomplished little until the Baker Board inspired its reconstitution in 1934. (A revised AR 95-20 was the instrument of change.) 72. Lt Col R. M. Jones, memorandum, subject: Major Aircraft Advisory Board, 8 April 1936, 2, AFHRA, file no. 167.5 (1935–1936).

Should fighter development emphasize interception or escort responsibilities? What types of all-purpose aircraft were suitable for aerial observation? In the case of two-seat fighters and fighter escort, the decisions later made by the Air Corps had unh
