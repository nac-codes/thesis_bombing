escort responsibilities? What types of all-purpose aircraft were suitable for aerial observation? In the case of two-seat fighters and fighter escort, the decisions later made by the Air Corps had unhappy consequences in the early phases of World War II.THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 232  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 259 --- 73.
