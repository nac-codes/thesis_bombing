upport aviation would grudgingly operate in a battle zone but only if absolutely necessary. It would strike troop transports, mechanized forces, and enemy formations. Last, in a postbattle environment, support aircraft would perform counterair operations and interdict hostile routes of retreat or the arrival of enemy delaying forces. In the case of the Navy, the role of land-based aviation in fleet actions would include attacks against battle-line, fast-wing, or individual vessels; attacks against light forces threatening battle-line flanks or disrupting friendly flanking maneuvers; the interdiction of hostile air operations through offensive operations; and attacks against convoy vessels. In particular, bombers would attack armed vessels, supply ships and transports, and naval bases.

ACB-35 based its argument on a major principle of war—economy of force. To use aircraft against objectives that are within range of ground or naval weapons is to use them in lieu of rather than in support of those weapons. See annex 4, p. 3. 86. “Analytical Study of J
