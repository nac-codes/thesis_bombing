briefly with the American Air Service  as an aircraft inspector in Buffalo, New York, de Seversky  found himself out of work. Young, aggressive, and ambitious, he soon opened a restaurant in Manhattan. He fell in love with America , and when fellow émigrés complained of conditions in their new home, he grew impatient and exclaimed, “If you don’t like it in this country you can always go back to Brooklyn.” 9 “Sascha,” as friends now called him, still viewed aviation as his chief interest, and in 1921 he met Brig Gen Billy Mitchell , the controversial and outspoken assistant chief of the Air Service . Mitchell  was then trying to “prove” the obsolescence of surface ships through a series of bombing tests. However, he feared that his aircraft’s bombs were not powerful enough to sink heavily armored warships. De Seversky  later claimed he suggested to Mitchell  the idea of dropping bombs next to the ships—not on them—to cause a “water hammer” effect that would open the seams in the side of the vessel below the waterline. Although this idea did not originate with de Seversky , it had validity. 10 In July 1921 Mitchell ’s aircraft used the water-hammer principle to sink several capital ships , including the German battleship Ostfriesland , off the Virginia coast. Over the next several years, de Seversky  worked with military airmen at McCook Field, Ohio , designing a gyroscopic bombsight hailed by Gen Mason Patrick , Air Service  chief. In addition, he began work on an idea he had conceived during the war. While flying in formation with another Russian plane one day, he playfully reached up and grabbed the trailing wire radio antenna of his mate, flying along “connected” to the other plane for several minutes. He suddenly realized that one could also use a wire or tube to transfer fuel from one aircraft to another in flight. Combat had taught him that bombardment aircraft were vulnerable to enemy fighter planes; thus, one needed escort  fighters to provide protection to
