.13 The P-35 featured two other unusual characteristics. First, it was extremely fast; a civilian version of it won the Bendix Air Race in 1937, 1938, and 1939. 14 Considering the fact that contemporary fighter  planes could barely keep pace with new bombers such as the B-17 , this was quite a feat. Second, it was specifically designed for long range (it could fly from coast to coast with only two refuelings), unlike other fighter  aircraft of the day, which were suitable only for point defense. Remembering his war experiences, de Seversky  recognized the need for fighter  aircraft with the range to escort bombers .15 One solution was the air refueling  device he had already patented, but extensive use of this system would have to wait another two decades. During the Vietnam War , tactical fighters  became strategic bombers  as a result of air refueling . In the late 1930s, however, people considered such an expedient too inefficient and costly. Designers, therefore, had to devise a method to extend the range of aircraft without air refueling .MEILINGER 243  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 270 --- Most of them thought that building a long-range escort  fighter was technically impossible, reasoning that any plane with the necessary range would have to be quite large in order to carry the requisite fuel. A large aircraft needed more than one engine and might require additional crew members, which, in turn, meant even larger size, more weight, more fuel, and so forth. In short, escorts  soon looked like the bombers  they were designed to protect and thus would become easy prey for enemy fighters. De Seversky , virtually alone among designers, was convinced that one could build a long-range escort  by using internal fuel tanks, which would not sacrifice the attributes characteristic of a successful fighter . At the same time, de Seversky  called for increased armament on fighter  planes. Whereas standard equipment generally consisted of two .30-caliber machi
