For example, airpower theorists typically criticized the conservative and traditional thinking of surface commanders , whom they considered relics of a bygone age. They did not understand the new air weapon, seeing it merely as an evolutionary development—a useful tool that would help them achieve their surface goals. This attitude was standard fare. But de Seversky  went a step further by taking on the leadership of the Air Corps , accusing it of equally outdated thinking. Specifically, he pointedly charged Arnold  with stymying innovative thought in aircraft development and being more concerned with “military politics” than with building effective airpower. 27 When in mid-1941 the War Department  announced a reorganization that created the semiautonomous Army Air Forces (AAF) , most airmen hailed it as a major step towards a separate service—their cherished goal. Not so de Seversky . He saw it as a dangerous half- measure—an “administrative enslavement”—to keep airmen in their place, a ploy by Arnold  to gain promotion. He did not believe it would seriously advance the cause of airpower. In a letter to President Roosevelt , he argued that the move was “positively harmful” because it gave an illusion of progress where none really existed. 28 As a consequence of these gratuitous and personal attacks, Arnold  kept de Seversky  at a distance; thus, these two powerful voices for airpower worked at cross-purposes, precisely at a time when they should have been close allies. Throughout his career, de Seversky  consciously attached himself to the Billy Mitchell  legend. He said once that MitchellMEILINGER 247  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 274 --- was his best friend, and he wrote several articles about the general, even dedicating his first book to his mentor’s memory. This affinity was not necessarily healthy because de Seversky  inherited Mitchell ’s inordinate distaste for the Navy . The saying that there is no greater antipathy towards ideas than that f
