memory. This affinity was not necessarily healthy because de Seversky  inherited Mitchell ’s inordinate distaste for the Navy . The saying that there is no greater antipathy towards ideas than that felt by the apostate was certainly true of former naval officer de Seversky . His writings consistently stressed the fleet’s lack of importance, arguing that sea power  was obsolete and that surface ships were doomed in the face of airpower. Like Mitchell , he often compared the cost of ships to that of aircraft, noting that one could buy hundreds of planes for the price of a single battleship . He even began one article with the blunt announcement that “our great two-ocean, multi-billion-dollar Navy , now in construction, should be completed five or six years from now—just in time to have all of its battleships  scrapped.”29 However, de Seversky  not only denigrated the gunships but also questioned the utility of aircraft carriers , seeing them as little more than attractive targets. He discounted their ability to project power ashore, asserting the inferiority of carrier planes to land-based planes. Conveniently ignoring the Pearl Harbor  attack, he stated that if carriers  attempted to strike a land power equipped with an air force, the latter would sink them long before their planes could perform any constructive purpose. 30 Like Mitchell ’s attacks, de Seversky ’s incessant barbs needlessly antagonized the Navy , while also spurring it to greater activity. Indeed, although the claim that Mitchell — and, by extension, de Seversky —was the father of naval aviation  is far too strong, it does contain a kernel of truth. As with most people of his generation who had lived through one world war only to see another spawned in its wake, de Seversky  believed that wars had become total. Distinctions between soldiers and civilians no longer existed— all people were part of the war effort. To de Seversky , this meant that all citizens might pay the ultimate price in war and th
