to fly over enemy armies and navies enabled it to strike directly at a country’s most vital  areas: its capital, industry, government, and so forth. Surface forces , on the other hand, generally fought only at the tactical level of war—force against force—hoping through an accumulation of victories in battle to position themselves for strategic, or decisive, military operations. Surface commanders  realized, however, that their operations would prove far easier and more successful if airpower supported them. De Seversky  cautioned against this, declaring that supporting an army tactically would squander airpower’s unique capability. One should employ airpower primarily as a strategic weapon and use it against targets  that had strategic significance. Similarly, de Seversky  rejected the view that the objective of war was to occupy territory—an outdated concept. Strategic airpower  could destroy the facilities and structures that made an area useful to the enemy: “Having knocked the weapons out of his hands and reduced the enemy to impotence, we can starve and beat him into submission by air power.” 45 This accomplished, oneTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 252  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 279 --- required occupation of only a humanitarian or political nature: the Red Cross or similar organizations would suffice. Second in importance, de Seversky  stressed the necessity of air superiority . The first two years of the war clearly demonstrated that whoever controlled the air also controlled the land and sea below. The French campaign especially illustrated the price an army had to pay when the enemy air force dominated the sky above it. To de Seversky , the most effective method of preventing this and protecting friendly soldiers involved gaining and maintaining air superiority  at the outset of a campaign. De Seversky  argued that one must seek this key battle for air superiority  as early as possible and conduct it with utmost vigor. Other air theorists , notably M
