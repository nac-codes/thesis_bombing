De Seversky  did not claim in Victory through Air Power  that airpower alone could win the war. Rather, he maintained that the airplane had become the dominant and decisive element in modern war. The vital role of land  and sea forces  was to hold the enemy in place while airpower pounded him into submission. In addition, the army and navy had to seize and hold air bases from which one could launch strategic air strikes  against the enemy’s heartland. Indeed, this was the strategy for the Pacific: the war against Japan  was essentially a struggle for air bases. Far-flung enemy islands had little strategic consequence; rather, they were useful as air bases for striking the Japanese home islands. As a way of lessening the dependence of airpower on these overseas air bases, de Seversky  pushed for the development of “interhemispheric” bombers  that could strike the enemy from the United States . He stated that such global bombers  would “change the whole picture of law enforcement”; the mere threat  of American airpower would be enough to keep the peace.48 He pointed to the massive B-19  and Martin flying boat  as examples of the type of long-range aircraft he envisioned, claiming that these behemoths had a payload capacity of over 30,000 pounds while also enjoying an unrefueled range of eight thousand miles. De Seversky  wanted thousands of such aircraft built. Unfortunately, his technical expertise deserted him in this instance. Both of these aircraft were underpowered and had structural shortcomings; they never came close to the performance de Seversky  claimed for them and never reached production. For the military to utilize airpower effectively, de Seversky called for a defense department with equal branches for land, sea, and air. He remained convince
