as the new president and his advisors—saw airpower as the only plausible solution. Such a strategy also necessitated a technologically first-rate air force, ready to fight at a moment’s notice. Clearly, de Seversky  had come a long way since the days before World War II , when he called for a balanced defense of land, sea, and air forces, while also rejecting suggestions that airpower alone could win wars. By the mid-1950s, he saw global airpower  as the solution to America ’s security needs. In some of his more outrageous suggestions, he called for a Department of the Air Force that contained a Bureau of Ships, a Bureau of Ground Forces, and bureaus “for other auxiliary units.” The Navy  would be drastically reduced so that only its antisubmarine warfare  activities and naval logistics functions remained. As for the Army , it should number a maximum of 250,000 troops, and its primary mission would be toMEILINGER 263  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 290 --- “maintain order in our country during an atomic holocaust, as well as to protect our domestic air and missile bases.” Obviously, he was now consigning the Army  and its leaders to the same dustbin occupied by the Navy . George Marshall  had “infantryitis,” Omar Bradley  (“the old monkey”) possessed a weak intellect, and Dwight Eisenhower  would “destroy and slaughter our youth” in areas like Korea  if he were elected president. (As noted above, he miscalculated dramatically regarding Eisenhower ’s intentions and was pleasantly surprised by most of his defense policies .) The Army , however, would also serve as an occupational police force after airpower had decided the matter. 81 Accomplishing all this was an Air Force  that received two-thirds of the defense budget  and that contained not a “mere” three hundred B-36  bombers then in procurement plans, but three thousand such goliaths to demolish potential adversaries with nuclear weapons  from bases in the United States .82 He had interesting beliefs
