undred B-36  bombers then in procurement plans, but three thousand such goliaths to demolish potential adversaries with nuclear weapons  from bases in the United States .82 He had interesting beliefs on the targeting strategy  behind such strikes. After achieving air superiority , global airpower (exemplified initially by manned bombers  and later by long-range guided missiles ) would strike the industrial center of the enemy. De Seversky  did not advocate merely bombing cities or targeting  the population. Such moves would prove counterproductive because “dead people don’t revolt.” Instead, he wanted to drive a wedge between the people and their leaders by attacking communications and transportation networks—by “disarming the government.” 83 This would result in an “internal blockade” of a country, causing paralysis  and inability to conduct war effectively. This emphasis clearly differed from that espoused by Douhet , who called for attacks on the population in order to foment rebellion. It also contrasted the thinking of theorists  at the Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS)  in the 1930s, who concentrated on enemy industry as a means of breaking the capability—not the will—of an enemy to fight. Consequently, de Seversky  offered a unique theory  of strategic airpower—related to, but distinct from, that of his precursors. The Air Force  was also studying the idea of “air policing ” in the early 1950s. Air planners  had looked at the experiences of the Royal Air Force  in the Middle East  between the wars. InTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 264  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 291 --- some cases, the RAF  had been quite successful at controlling large tribal areas through threatening air attack  and, if necessary, discreetly using it. Significantly, the RAF  could maintain order in places like Iraq  and Transjordan  at a fraction of the cost of using ground forces  for the same mission. In 1950 the Air Staff considered resurrecting this idea, terming it Project Control
