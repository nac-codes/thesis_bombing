order in places like Iraq  and Transjordan  at a fraction of the cost of using ground forces  for the same mission. In 1950 the Air Staff considered resurrecting this idea, terming it Project Control , and chose de Seversky  to participate as a member of the lengthy study that ensued. The basic premise of the project was that one could use airpower to pressure the Soviet Union  into following policies favorable to the West. If persuasion and threats proved unsuccessful, then selective strikes—with atomic weapons  if necessary—would put teeth in the threats. The Air Staff assumed that Soviet leaders would react just as backward tribes of the 1920s had reacted. 84 This proposal—which sounded to some extent like de Seversky ’s “internal blockade” plan—was, of course, never implemented. However, it received serious consideration from the Truman  and Eisenhower administrations. This entire idea of persuasion or “air policing ” signified an evolution in de Seversky ’s thought. In Victory through Air Power , he had discussed only two methods of applying military force: occupation—the traditional strategy of ground warfare —and destruction, now possible through airpower. Over the next decade he modified this view, seeing not only that airpower made possible the “neutralization” of an enemy, but also that peaceful applications of airpower  could achieve national objectives . Viewing airpower as an enormously effective propaganda  tool, he advocated the delivery of “ideas” as well as essentials such as food, clothing, and medicine via airpower to win friends and undermine enemies. Testifying before Congress  in 1951, he exclaimed that too many people saw airpower as nothing more than “bombs, bombs, bombs.” 85 Yet de Seversky  himself was guilty of this tendency. Indeed, by advocating massive retaliation  and at the same time calling for a relatively benign air policing  strategy, de Seversky  created a contradiction that he never resolved. One may attribute this ambivalence,
