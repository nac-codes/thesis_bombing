and political leaders—must understand all these ideas. In order to ensure that this was the case, America  must see itself as an airpower nation and look skyward for its destiny. Like many other air theorists , de Seversky  exaggerated the effectiveness of airpower . He overestimated the physical and psychological effects  of strategic bombing . In this sense, he shared the shortcomings of his predecessors. Like Douhet  and Mitchell , de Seversky  understood the importance of morale and will , realizing that, somehow, one must modify or bend the enemy’s will . Unlike them, however, he rejected the notion that urban area bombing  best produced this effect. Instead, he opted for airpower’s use against enemy industry or infrastructure. All of these men had the same goal—to break, or at least shape, enemy will —but chose different mechanisms to reach that goal. In short, they identified different key centers  against which airpower should concentrate. Again, like Douhet  and Mitchell , de Seversky  combined this emphasis on psychological goals with a penchant for selecting highly mechanistic methods. The major was convinced that a finite number of planes and bombs, delivered on specific targets, would equal victory. Air strategy  consisted of destroying target sets , resulting in a curious blend of psychology and science. In the parlance of more classical military theory , he melded Carl von Clausewitz  and Henri de Jomini . But the product was not altogether satisfactory. For example, he never seemed to appreciate the fact that nuclear weapons  had an even greater impact on the human mind than on physical structures. They represented a threshold, and discussions about their use far transcended considerations of military effectiveness. De Seversky  clearly misjudged the technical obstacles to building large aircraft. His trumpeting of the Douglas B-19 and Martin flying boat  proved premature. He designed a “superclipper” in the late 1930s, but it never got off the draw
