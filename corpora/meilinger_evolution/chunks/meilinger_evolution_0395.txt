the distressing traits of airpower theorists  is their tendency to claim too much for their chosen weapon. Airpower does not have to win wars alone  in order to be decisive , any more than does an army. True unification— what today we would call “jointness ”—recognizes that all weapons and services have unique strengths and weaknesses. Wise commanders choose those weapons and capabilities that will most effectively and efficiently accomplish their objectives. In the type of war envisioned by de Seversky , the unique capabilities of airpower  were at a premium. But airpower alone could not do everything. Nevertheless, Alexander P. de Seversky  captured the essence of a new weapon of war—and peace—and then conveyed an understanding of that essence to millions of Americans in a way unduplicated by anyone else, before him or since.

As a prophet, he was mediocre. As a propagandizer, he was exceptional. Notes 1. “Alexander P. de Seversky,” U.S. Air Services,  August 1937, 18–19. 2.
