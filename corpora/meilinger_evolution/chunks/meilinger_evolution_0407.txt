about strategic- and operational -level airpower  is often startling. The subject of nuclear strategy  is quite different: its theoretical soil has been cultivated nearly to the point of exhaustion, and in many places it has been virtually paved over by 50 years of intense study. During its first two decades, nuclear strategic  thought reached a plateau of maturity, where it essentially remains today. Although it is not quite the case that nothing new has been said about this subject since Thomas Schelling ’s Arms and Influence  and Bernard Brodie ’s Escalation and the Nuclear Option  appeared in 1966, subsequent work in the field generally has been limited to offering marginal (though often extremely significant) insights, challenges, and illumination of the work that went before. 1 Both new nuclear technological developments and new nuclear policy  debates, some of them important, have engaged scholars and other participants during the last 30 years, but, with few exceptions, these matters represent the reemergence of much older precursors. 2 The relative stasis of strategic nuclear thought during the last generation has led some people to characterize it as a theoretical dead end, ultimately rendered obsolete by the end of the US-Soviet cold war , if not before. In reality, however, the field reached an early theoretical plateau due to its rapid initial development, along with the intrinsic simplicity of the *The author thanks Mark Bovankovich, Mark Conversino, Thomas Ehrhard, C harles Glaser, Jonathan Kirshner, John Mueller, Robert Pape, Dan Reiter, and Jeffrey Re nehan for their generous advice and comments on this essay. 279  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 305 --- subject. Although a lifetime of scholarship is insufficient for most students of conventional warfare  to master their subject, any reasonably intelligent undergraduate can learn the essentials of nuclear strategy  in mere hours of instruction and study—or can become reasonably expert in
