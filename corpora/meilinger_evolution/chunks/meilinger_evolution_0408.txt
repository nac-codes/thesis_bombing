onal warfare  to master their subject, any reasonably intelligent undergraduate can learn the essentials of nuclear strategy  in mere hours of instruction and study—or can become reasonably expert in the subject in a semester. Indeed, 93 minutes spent watching Stanley Kubrick ’s consummate film Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb  (1964) will teach attentive viewers much of what they need to know in order to understand the principal nuclear debates .3 These factors made nuclear strategy  an unpromising subject for most writers of dissertations during the second half of the cold war , but they did not make it unimportant. Rather, the theories and insights developed by theorists of the “golden age” of deterrence theory —and subsequently refined by their successors—remain relevant, and one can see their growing influence on (or at least their congruence with) conventional airpower theory today. Because other writers have already ably documented and recounted the historical development of nuclear  weapons 4 and nuclear strategic  theory5 in far more substantial works, this essay does not seek to retell this story. Nor does it attempt to summarize the evolution of US or other nuclear strategies  and war plans 6—the development of which occurred parallel to but often almost completely disconnected from the work of nuclear strategic theorists —or of nuclear arms control .7 Instead, the following sections offer a brief sketch of the technological aspects of the nuclear revolution , as well as a primer on the enduring principles of nuclear strategic thought, focusing on the similarities and differences between this discipline and the other major strands of airpower theory. Finally, the essay concludes with a discussion of both the contemporary relevance (and irrelevance) of nuclear strategy  and its relationship with contemporary theories of nonnuclear airpower .
