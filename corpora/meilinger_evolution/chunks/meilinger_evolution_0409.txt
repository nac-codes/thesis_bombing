levance (and irrelevance) of nuclear strategy  and its relationship with contemporary theories of nonnuclear airpower . The Nuclear Revolution Most technological revolutions  happen gradually, resulting not from a single event but from the cumulative effect of a number of related innovations. This was certainly the caseTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 280  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 306 --- with the aviation revolution —and with the nuclear revolution as well. In both instances, technological developments paralleled the development of theories about their implications and application, with theorists  sometimes leading the way and sometimes trying to keep pace with advances driven by technological imperatives. However, there probably has never been another revolution  quite so dominated by technological forces as this one, or one in which theory  and doctrine  were so deductively derived from characteristics of the weapons  whose use they were intended to guide. Therefore, one may reasonably begin with an overview of the key technological elements that accumulated to form the mature nuclear strategic world that we have known since the late 1960s, before turning to the theories  that seek to explain it. Nuclear Warheads During the Second World War , the Anglo-American Manhattan Project  produced the first atomic  bombs—tested in New Mexico and then dropped at Hiroshima  and Nagasaki  in the summer of 1945. The Soviet Union  tested its first atomic bomb in 1949, followed by Great Britain  in 1952. This first generation of nuclear weapons  derived its revolutionary explosive power from nuclear fission —the splitting of heavy, unstable elements (uranium 235 and plutonium 239) into smaller atoms, releasing vast amounts of energy as blast, light, heat, and other forms of radiation. 8 Early atomic  bombs were on the order of one thousand times more powerful than conventional explosive bombs of similar size; fission weapons subsequently became smaller and more efficient,
