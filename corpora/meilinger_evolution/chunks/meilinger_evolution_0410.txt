diation. 8 Early atomic  bombs were on the order of one thousand times more powerful than conventional explosive bombs of similar size; fission weapons subsequently became smaller and more efficient, evolving into today’s tactical nuclear weapons .9 The destruction that a single atomic  bomb could wreak on a city or other target was comparable to that inflicted by a massive conventional air raid involving hundreds of heavy bombers . (One should recall that the deadliest bombing raid of the Second World War  occurred not at Hiroshima  or Nagasaki but Tokyo , on the first night of the US firebombing  of that city, 9–10 March 1945.) One may fairly say that with this technology , airpower had finally caught up with Douhet ’s imagination. A state equipped with heavy bombers  carryingMUELLER 281  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 307 --- atomic  bombs could destroy many of its enemy’s cities in rapid succession, even in the face of substantial defenses. 10 The next (and the last, to date) fundamental advance in nuclear explosive technology  came in the 1950s, as all three of the nuclear powers developed thermonuclear (or hydrogen) weapons . Using atomic explosives as triggers, hydrogen bombs  employ nuclear fusion —the combining of heavy isotopes of hydrogen into heavier helium atoms—to produce explosions one thousand times more powerful than those from similar-sized atomic  bombs, or a million times more powerful than conventional  explosives. Although a postwar atomic bomb could devastate the center of a medium-sized city, a reasonably large thermonuclear weapon  could obliterate a large metropolitan area—even if delivered with considerable inaccuracy. Nuclear attack  now threatened major powers not only with massive urban casualties and devastation but also with effective national destruction. 11 Subsequent developments in nuclear warhead technology have occurred around the margins, as weapons have become smaller with specialized characteristics—such as reduce
