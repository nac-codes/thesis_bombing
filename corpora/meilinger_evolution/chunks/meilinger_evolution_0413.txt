age 309 --- Generally smaller and shorter ranged than their land-based counterparts, as well as solid-fueled, SLBMs  offered the tremendous advantage of being based on platforms difficult or impossible to detect and attack prior to missile launch. 14 Their principal disadvantage was a significant reduction in accuracy compared to ICBMs , which persisted until the United States  deployed the Trident D-5  SLBM  in the late 1980s. 15 SLBMs  were also less easily controlled by central authorities than were land-based systems since their submarines  had to be able to operate with a considerable degree of autonomy. This is probably why they played a relatively small role in the Soviet arsenal compared to those of the United States , Britain , and France . As improvements in radar, missiles , and interceptor  aircraft increased the difficulty of slipping through hostile air defenses , another response was to equip bombers  with standoff weapons —nuclear-armed missiles  that one could fire at a target from some hundreds of miles away. One could use these weapons as the aircraft’s primary armament instead of free-fall bombs, to reduce the bomber ’s exposure to enemy fire, or could fire them at early warning radars and SAM  sites in order to suppress the enemy’s defenses and make penetration easier. 16 A new technology  with profound strategic implications appeared in the late 1960s with the development of multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles (MIRV) . By replacing the single warhead on a missile with a postboost vehicle or “bus” carrying multiple—and now very accurate—warheads (or reentry vehicles [RV] ),17 each of which could strike a different target, a single missile conceivably could destroy a larger number of the enemy’s nuclear weapons  (providing incentives to strike first in a crisis, as discussed in more detail below) or other dispersed targets. Multiple warheads were also potentially useful for penetrating antimissile defenses since they would increase t
