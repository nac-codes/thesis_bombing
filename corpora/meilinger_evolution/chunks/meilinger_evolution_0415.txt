uitable for carrying either conventional  or nuclear  warheads. Still other nuclear-delivery systems have been planned or developed without being deployed. 18 Most notably, the Outer Space Treaty of 1967  outlawed the placement of nuclear weapons  in orbit (or on the Moon), and an international agreement in 1971 proscribed the placement of nuclear weapons on the oceanic floor. Space-based weapons  were especially threatening because they could attack with little warning; similar concerns led to a ban on testing SLBMs  in depressed- trajectory mode, in which a submarine  fires the missile at a shallower angle than normal in order to shorten the length of its flight and minimize the defender’s warning. The most recent nuclear-delivery system not quite to appear was the so-called supergun, under construction in Iraq  prior to the Gulf War .19 Basing The evolution of nuclear  warheads and their delivery systems has principally focused on features familiar in almost all airpower theory—firepower, accuracy, speed, range, penetration ability, and flexibility. An additional area ofMUELLER 285  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 311 --- concern (to nuclear strategists , perhaps the most important one of all) relates to the basing mode of nuclear weapons , especially as this affects their survivability in the event of an enemy first strike. Protecting bombers  from preemptive attack remained a relatively straightforward problem, particularly before the development of nuclear-armed missiles . When air bases were vulnerable only to attack by manned aircraft, one could develop and maintain sufficient early warning capabilities and alert levels to enable the bombers  to take off before the enemy could destroy them on the ground. Another obvious response, but one the United States  did not quickly adopt, was the basing of bombers  far from the enemy’s bases in order to maximize warning times in the event of an enemy attack. Perhaps the greatest direct impact that civilian
