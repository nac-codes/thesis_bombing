ates  did not quickly adopt, was the basing of bombers  far from the enemy’s bases in order to maximize warning times in the event of an enemy attack. Perhaps the greatest direct impact that civilian strategists ever had on American nuclear policy  came in the 1950s, when Albert Wohlstetter  and others at RAND  explained to the Air Force  that the US bomber  force could be vulnerable to a surprise nuclear attack  at its forward bases around the Soviet periphery. 20 The appearance of ballistic missiles  complicated this problem considerably, further encouraging the dispersal of bomber  forces to secondary airfields in the event of a crisis and the maintenance of some US bombers on constant airborne alert. The deployment of SLBMs , with their shorter flight times, made the problem worse, but one could still reasonably expect successful launch of at least a portion of an alert bomber  force before its bases came under attack. Advances in surveillance satellites ’ ability to detect enemy missile launches reinforced this expectation. The problem of ICBM  survivability proved more challenging, since the missiles had to stay on the ground until authorities made a final decision to launch. One could not launch early ICBMs  on short notice, due to the need to fuel them, and an enemy could easily destroy their above-ground launch sites. During the 1960s, the advent of storable liquid (later solid) rocket propellants, the deployment of ICBMs  in hardened underground silos, and the development of SLBMs  carried by nuclear-powered submarines  addressed these problems. 21 Because one could reliably destroy hardened silos—relatively resistant to blast effects—only by the explosion of a warheadTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 286  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 312 --- in close proximity, an enemy would have to attack each silo separately and would need to use only fairly accurate weapons against them. Thus, SLBMs  would not prove useful for attacking ICBMs . Further, if two states
