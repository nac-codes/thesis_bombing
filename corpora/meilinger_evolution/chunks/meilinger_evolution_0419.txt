ined the combination of early warning radars, interceptors , and antiaircraft artillery (AAA) . The United States  deployed SAMs , air-to-air  missiles, and rockets armed with small nuclear warheads to increase the effectiveness of its air defenses . The improving capabilities of air defense  systems prompted rapid developments in electronic warfare  and standoff weapons , a shift to low-level flight profiles to take advantage of difficulties that ground clutter imposed on radar detection, and research into stealth technologies  to reduce the visibility of aircraft to radar and other sensors. Although never easy for the bomber , getting through modern air defenses  was not impossibleâ€”and nuclear weapons  meant that one could not disregard even a low percentage of successful penetrations. Ballistic missiles  presented an even more difficult defensive problem. In order for a SAM  to be an effective ABM , it needed to be able to shoot down an extremely small, sturdy projectileTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 288  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 314 --- reentering the atmosphere at perhaps 20 times the speed of sound, with relatively little time to detect and track the target. During the 1960s, the United States  developed several such systems to the testing stage, involving large exoatmospheric interceptor missiles  with thermonuclear  warheads as a first line of defense, backed up by shorter-range missiles with small nuclear warheads to attack RVs  that had penetrated the first layer. 26 The arms race between ballistic missiles  and ABMs  had several highly unattractive features. First, as one side developed its ABM  system, the other could simply increase the number of warheads it could launch in order to ensure that some of them would penetrate the defenses. This meant that one state could render itself immune to a nuclear first strike only if the other allowed it to do so (or ran out of money). However, a less-than-perfect ABM  system might allow the owning state to
