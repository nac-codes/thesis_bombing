at one state could render itself immune to a nuclear first strike only if the other allowed it to do so (or ran out of money). However, a less-than-perfect ABM  system might allow the owning state to launch a successful first strike , since defenses capable of stopping only part of the enemy’s total nuclear arsenal might prove quite effective against the weaker retaliatory  strike of a state just subjected to massive nuclear attack . Therefore, ABM  opponents argued, investing in extremely expensive defenses made sense only for an aggressive nation—to protect second-strike countervalue forces  otherwise vulnerable to preemptive attack  or to limit damage from a strike by a minor nuclear power undeterred by retaliatory  threats.27 The combination of high prospective costs and limited strategic benefits led the United States  and the Soviet Union  to sign a treaty as part of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT)  I agreement in 1972, effectively banning ABMs .28 With the country vulnerable to nuclear missile  attack, US investment in defenses against bombers became of limited value and gradually tapered off. From the earliest days of the nuclear era, the desire to limit damage in the event of an enemy nuclear attack also led to civil defense  efforts to protect populations and industry. In the United States , civil defense  lost some of its viability and most of its popularity once the Soviet Union  had achieved the ability to deliver large numbers of thermonuclear weapons  against the United States . Soviet enthusiasm for civil defense  persisted to a greater extent, and the United States  often interpreted it as aMUELLER 289  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 315 --- sign of willingness to fight a nuclear war . Eventually, however, it became clear that Soviet civil defense  preparedness was considerably lower in reality than in rhetoric. 29 Ballistic missile defense (BMD)  returned to prominence in the 1980s after President Ronald Reagan ’s announceme
