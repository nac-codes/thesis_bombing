viet civil defense  preparedness was considerably lower in reality than in rhetoric. 29 Ballistic missile defense (BMD)  returned to prominence in the 1980s after President Ronald Reagan ’s announcement in 1983 of a Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)  program to build a space-based ABM  system, which quickly became known as “Star Wars” to almost all but its most intense advocates. 30 Although SDI  involved research into a new generation of sensors and weapons—particularly a wide range of lasers and other directed-energy weapons —the strategic and budgetary debates surrounding it were virtually indistinguishable from those about ABMs  20 years earlier. Again, the prospects for developing the complete missile shield that Reagan  envisioned (generally referred to as the “astrodome” concept) appeared weak, even within the SDI  organization; a variety of less comprehensive defenses remained attractive to many people but drew criticism as being unreasonably expensive, technologically infeasible, or of limited value except as a supplement to a US first strike  against the USSR . The apparent decline of Soviet hostility in the late 1980s (attributed in part to Moscow’s recognition that it could not afford to engage in expensive BMD  and other arms races  with the United States ) resulted in reduced spending on SDI , but the program continued, shifting its emphasis to theater BMD against shorter-range missiles launched by regional powers such as Iraq . Principles of Strategic Nuclear Theory Many of the rudiments of nuclear theory  have already appeared in the preceding sections, for they are inextricably tied to—and largely derived from—the infrastructure of nuclear technology . Although nuclear strategic theory  may be the single most deductive body of thought in the social sciences, its development proved something less—but perhaps not far less—than a logical inevitability. Again, one should consider the parallels between analyses of strategic airpower  during the interwar
