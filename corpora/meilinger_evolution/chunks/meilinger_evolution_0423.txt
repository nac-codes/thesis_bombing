y real information regarding actual weapons effects).33 Second, a far smaller number of theorists , few of them with academic training, dominated airpower thought during the interwar period. Most of them were serving military officers with operational rather than strategic experience, facing many nonintellectual challenges, including the preservation or advancement of their beleaguered service arms. The closest interwar equivalent to the community of (mostly American) postwar nuclear theorists  was the US Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS)  of the late 1930s. A comparison of the two is striking. Despite the intellectual fertility of ACTS , the theories it generated were dominated by the work of a gifted few who had to be concerned not only with predicting the future but also with ensuring that independent  strategic airpower  would have a prominent role in it. On the other hand, strategic nuclearMUELLER 291  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 317 --- airpower  was the subject of intense study by a large community, including many highly trained and intelligent people who could focus the bulk of their energies on the subject. Finally, one should note that after 1945 the US military almost completely abdicated its traditional responsibility for strategic airpower  thought, passing it to the civilian experts they employed and whose guidance they occasionally followed. Strategic Air Command (SAC)  planners remained occupied with compiling theoretical target lists  and operational-level war plans  and continued in general to approach strategic airpower  much as their wartime predecessors had during the Combined Bomber Offensive .34 This is not to hold up RAND  as the intellectual heir of Platoâ€™s academy; indeed, it inherited the legacy of Douhet  and Alexander de Seversky . However, the nuclear theorists  enjoyed the advantage of being, if not powerful themselves, at least consultants to the makers of military policy  rather than prophets in the wilderness. They did
