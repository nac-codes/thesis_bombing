pendent states. Nuclear weapons  and associated technologies  brought to the table the ability to inflict catastrophic damage against an enemy, rapidly and relatively inexpensively. In one of Thomas Schelling ’s typically vivid expressions, they vastly increased their owners’ power to hurt.42 Because nuclear weapons systems generally didn’t have to fight the enemy’s nuclear weapons , the balance of nuclear forces was irrelevant; the relationship between weapons and targets determined the ability to punish, and thus to deter—and one did not need many nuclear weapons  to destroy even a large target. Similarly, if each side could inflict unacceptable levels of damage on the other, it did not matter which one could cause the greater amount. Thus, a powerful state could develop moreTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 294  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 320 --- nuclear striking power than it had any use for. Although sound strategic reasons existed for the superpowers to build what critics derided as overkill capability during the cold war , both the United States  and the Soviet Union  could have built much larger nuclear arsenals than they actually chose to do. 43 Assured Destruction and Mutual Assured Destruction If deterrence  is the foundation of most strategic nuclear theory , the conceptual cornerstone of the edifice is assured destruction —the ability of a state to destroy its enemy with a retaliatory nuclear  strike even after it is attacked. A state capable of assured destruction  ought never worry about attack from a state without such capability, since by choosing war, the latter would commit national suicide. Two states having such a capability exist in a relationship of mutual assured destruction and never should attack each other. The United States  had developed an assured destruction  capability against the Soviet Union  by the mid-1950s, if not before.  Nuclear experts often believed that the Soviets did not attain this capability towards the United States
