hus, accurate ICBMs , which possess these characteristics, have counterforce  capability. The survivability of second-strike nuclear  forces is critical, since a nuclear state vulnerable to destruction by an enemy first strike not only lacks assured destruction  capability but actually creates incentives for the enemy to strike first , in the event of a crisis likely to escalate to nuclear war . As a result of all of these factors, SLBMs  are generally considered ideal second-strike countervalue weapons, since they are nearly invulnerable while on station and their limitations with respect to accuracy and command and control (C2) do not create serious obstacles to performing this mission. However, even more vulnerable land-based systems can pose effective threats of assured destruction , since a first strike  would have to destroy a very high percentage of a large force in order to reduce its retaliatory  potential to a level that would not be tremendously destructive. Since even a massive countervalue strike against a superpower would require only a relatively small number of thermonuclear weapons , many believers in the deterrent efficacy of MAD  argued that the superpowers’ cold war  nuclear arsenals were much larger than necessary. Fears about the vulnerability of land-based nuclear weapons  to an enemy first strike  have prompted a number of major changes in nuclear force postures. On the American side, fears of a first strike by the strategic rocket forces of the Soviet Union  encouraged a shift away from forward-based medium bombers  and the ultimately abortive search for a survivable basing mode for the MX  ICBM . As for the Soviets, cumulative threats posed by the highly accurate MX , the counterforce-capable Trident D-5  SLBM , and other new and accurate US weapons such as the air launched cruise missile (ALCM)  spurred the Soviet adoption of mobile  ICBMs  in the 1980s. Improvements in missile accuracy did not threaten either country’s strategic submarine
