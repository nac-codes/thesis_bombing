apons such as the air launched cruise missile (ALCM)  spurred the Soviet adoption of mobile  ICBMs  in the 1980s. Improvements in missile accuracy did not threaten either country’s strategic submarine  forces, but the prospect of relying on only one leg of the triad  appealed to neither side,THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 296  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 322 --- and (as discussed below) the Soviets had reason to worry about the security of their fleet ballistic missile submarines (SSBN) as well. Concerns about vulnerability also prompted development of options to launch under attack (LUA)  instead of riding out an enemy first strike .46 Assured destruction  capability also requires that a state’s nuclear command, control, and communications (C 3) capabilities have a reasonable chance of surviving an enemy first strike  in order to avoid strategic decapitation .47 This became the subject of extensive study by nuclear scholars during the 1980s, when concerns about the robustness of US nuclear C 2 arrangements led to a major increase in investment in this area. Such programs would replace aging airborne command-post aircraft and would harden communications systems against the effects of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) .48 Although assured destruction  and MAD  underpinned American declaratory nuclear strategy , at least from the early 1960s, lesser nuclear powers such as France  have based theirs on a variation on the same theme. When Sweden considered developing nuclear weapons , the Swedish military aptly described this principle as “marginal cost deterrence”: the strategy of threatening to retaliate  against an invader with enough force not necessarily to destroy it but to significantly negate any benefits the invader might anticipate from conquering the small nuclear power. 49 At heart, this is similar to a superpower’s assured destruction  threat, except that the prospective attacker’s national survival may not be at stake; for the United States  and the Soviet Un
