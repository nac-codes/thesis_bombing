any grounds. 53 Some offer arguments about its strategic logic and assumptions, addressed below. Others base their opposition on moral objections to the targeting  of civilian populations 54—or on the grounds that dangers posed by the existence of nuclear weapons  remain intolerably high, making their abolition imperative. 55 The basic argument about whether MAD  acts as a stabilizing force in international affairs also lies at the heart of the central debate regarding nuclear proliferation —the development or acquisition of nuclear weapons  by previously nonnuclear states. The conventional wisdom about proliferation  traditionally was, and to a considerable extent still is, that the spread of nuclear weapons  is destabilizing because (1) new nuclear states are likely to be less responsible than their predecessors and (2) arsenals of so-called threshold nuclear states tend to be vulnerable to preemption—and therefore will encourage it. 56 However, a number of strategic theorists  have argued that if MAD  stabilizes superpower relations, one should expect it to do the same for regional rivalries among smaller powers. This school of thought rejects as ethnocentric the argument that Third World  states will be more reckless in their handling of nuclear weapons  than Western states have been, and proposes that the nuclear powers ought to help threshold nuclear states pass through the transition period to survivable second-strike  capability as smoothly as possible. 57THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 298  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 324 --- Credibility The preceding discussion of assured destruction  focused on issues of capability, but almost as important to nuclear deterrence  is the credibility of threats. Actually carrying out a threat to use nuclear weapons  would inevitably involve significant costs for the state concerned, 58 and these might well exceed the benefits, if any, expected from previous promises. Of course, although one need not automatically believe
