erican threat of assured destruction  against the possibility of decapitation .63 An additional variation on the doomsday machine  theme appeared in the 1980s, when scientists discovered that a massive nuclear strike  might produceMUELLER 299  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 325 --- substantial global climatic change, raising the possibility that even a fully successful first strike  could significantly injure the country that launched it. 64 An opposite approach to the credibility problem entailed providing leaders with limited nuclear options (LNO)  that might prove relatively credible, whereas an all-out attack would not. Much attention focused on LNOs  in the United States  during the early 1970s, but they always existed to some extent, even in the purest moments of the doctrine of massive retaliation  of the late 1950s. 65 Although its opponents often accused MAD  of presenting leaders with a choice between surrender and suicide in the event of limited attack, this never amounted to a fair accusation, since most of the people who lauded MAD  believed in the possibility of limited countervalue attacks , at least for demonstration purposes. 66 However, counterforce LNO  enthusiasts parted company from MAD theorists  in their beliefs about the controllability of nuclear war . The former tended to envision a relatively prolonged process of brinkmanship and escalation in which one could recognize limited counterforce strikes  as such; the latter did not think that escalation  would automatically occur, but they had little confidence that the fog of nuclear war would permit such subtle bargaining. MAD  enthusiasts also refused to be alarmed by the problem of limited threat credibility, emphasizing that even a small possibility of catastrophe is very frightening. This debate reached its zenith with arguments for and against the need for escalation dominance â€”a concept promoted by theorists who offered an alternative approach to nuclear strategy commonly ref
