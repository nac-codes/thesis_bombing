g. This debate reached its zenith with arguments for and against the need for escalation dominance —a concept promoted by theorists who offered an alternative approach to nuclear strategy commonly referred to as nuclear war fighting. 67 War fighters who supported a “countervailing” strategy conceived of a ladder of escalation  ranging from limited and major conventional war up through levels of nuclear conflict with progressively fewer limitations, before arriving at full-blown countervalue apocalypse. They argued for the necessity of maintaining escalation dominance —the ability to fight and win on whatever rung of the ladder the enemy chose—to avoid having to choose between losing, surrendering, or escalating to a more extreme level of violence.  In short, if the enemy could find—or invent—aTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 300  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 326 --- rung on the ladder from which it could prevail, it would have an incentive to strike. Skeptics of the countervailing approach rejected the premise that such a ladder existed for several reasons. First, they maintained that limitations of sensors and intelligence prevented one from distinguishing among subtly different levels of nuclear warfare .68 Second, they argued that even if one could make such distinctions, the scheme would work only if both sides conceived of the escalatory steps in the same way. Since one might define levels of violence by the weapons used, the types or numbers of targets attacked, the location of the targets or of the launchers, the scale of civilian damage, or other criteria (evidence indicates that Soviet and American doctrine did indeed differ in these matters), they suggested that the war fighters were trying to impose a degree of precision upon nuclear warfare that it intrinsically lacked. Third, as discussed below, they warned that war-fighting doctrines  and the weapons systems associated with them would create instability and encourage preemptive attacks . Finally, they
