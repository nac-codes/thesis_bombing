ted that doing so would result in severe nuclear retaliation . If nuclear war  (or a comparable cataclysm, such as conquest) appeared inevitable—especially if it also appeared imminent— states would have great incentives to attack first  if doing so would significantly reduce the amount of damage they would eventually suffer (or perhaps dramatically increase the damage they could inflict without increasing their own losses). In terms of deterrence theory , when the value of not starting a war begins to look extremely bad, war becomes relatively attractive; stability becomes endangered when states have reason to expect the status quo to lead to catastrophe. It becomes especially endangered when a state perceives a window of opportunity —a temporary chance to avert or mitigate the disaster. In nuclear strategy , one can expect windows of opportunity for preventive war when an adversary state appears likely to acquire and use nuclear weapons  in the near future—or to acquire a first-strike  capability that it does not yet possess. 78 Similarly, a state might perceive such a window if its second-strike  capability were threatened by an adversary’s anticipated development of strategic defenses , and if it expected the adversary would then attack or otherwise exploit this escape from MAD . In the early 1980s, Barry Posen brought to light a particularly noteworthy preemption scenario by observing that the Reagan  administration’s new maritime strategy  for offensive naval operations  in the Barents Sea during a conventional war in Europe  would gradually destroy much of the Soviet SLBM  force, endangering Moscow’s second-strike  capability. At the same time, one could expect a conventional air war  in Europe  to incapacitate Soviet early warning radar capability in the region, giving the Soviet Union reason to fear being decapitated  or disarmed by a surprise Western nuclear first strike .79 The Enduring Importance of Strategic Nuclear Airpower Theory In the post-cold-war
