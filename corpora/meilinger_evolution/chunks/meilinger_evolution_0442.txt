US and Russian weapons are no longer aimed at their cold war  targets, garnering widespread acclaim in spite of the strategic (if not political) superficiality of this measure. Yet, nuclear weapons  continue to lurk in the background as the ultimate guarantors of American and Russian security , as well as British, French, Chinese, Israeli, Indian, and Pakistani security. For each of these states, essentially the same nuclear issues matter—survivability, first-  and second-strike capabilities, and potential adversaries’ expectations about the values of war and peace. 80 Nuclear weapons  continue to figure into extended deterrence  as well, most visibly in the 1990s during the Gulf War , when Britain  and the United States  as well as Israel  made veiled and unveiled threats to Iraq  of nuclear retaliation  against chemical weapon
