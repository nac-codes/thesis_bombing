well, most visibly in the 1990s during the Gulf War , when Britain  and the United States  as well as Israel  made veiled and unveiled threats to Iraq  of nuclear retaliation  against chemical weapons  attacks. The spread of nuclear  weapons  continues to proceed very gradually, incessantly defying the expectations of proliferation alarmists. Prospective nuclear powers, like their predecessors, have weighed the costs and benefits of joining the nuclear club, and only a few see profit in it.81 Even the far less expensive spread of biological  and chemical weapons  has been slower than many people have expected, but sound reasons remain for serious concern about this less celebrated threat. 82 In deciding how to deal with each of these developments, scholars and statesmen again turn for guidance to deterrence and other theory originally developed for the nuclear world but relevant to other weapons  of mass destruction (or individual or small group destruction, for that matter). Interestingly, oneTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 306  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 332 --- can see the roots of MAD  not only in the early nuclear world but also a decade earlier, when both Germany  and the Allies opted not to employ nerve gas and other chemical  or biological weapons  during the Second World War , largely due to fear of reprisals by their enemies. 83 In some respects, conventional airpower , too, resembles its nuclear cousin more and more as advances occur in the guidance of precision munitions , stealth , and other technologies. Contemporary arguments about the coercive impact of targeting leaders, C 2 systems, economic infrastructure, military forces, or civilian populations essentially recapitulate debates about strategic nuclear targeting  from the 1980s and before, save that conventional weapons  would produce far less collateral damage .84 Schelling â€™s coercive principle of targeting what the enemy values applies similarly in both the nuclear and conventional worlds,
