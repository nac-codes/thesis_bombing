hat conventional weapons  would produce far less collateral damage .84 Schelling ’s coercive principle of targeting what the enemy values applies similarly in both the nuclear and conventional worlds, underpinning both yesterday’s and today’s debates about the relative merits of punishment and denial. Similarly, “parallel attack ” and the quest for strategic paralysis achieved with conventional airpower  share a distinct kinship with the pursuit of “splendid” first strikes  and nuclear decapitation . The nuclear revolution  in airpower meant that the bomb (if not always the bomber ) would in general get through and that nuclear powers could do all sorts of damage that they could not do before to an enemy without needing to conquer him first. To a considerable degree, the more recent conventional airpower revolution  of smart weapons  and stealth  does something similar, except far less expensively, for both the attacker and the target. Even the concept of MAD  may be relevant to sophisticated conventional strategic attack. If, as strategic airpower  advocates of several generations have argued, one can effectively cripple or destroy states from the air with nonnuclear attacks against key economic, communications, and other assets, and if states value their own survival, it may not matter decisively for deterrence  that this threat involves the deaths of thousands or hundreds instead of millions. In other respects, however, conventional airpower  becomes less and less like nuclear force as its ability to destroy targets inexpensively and comparatively cleanly improves, and as itsMUELLER 307  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 333 --- employers (at least in the West) increasingly eschew the option of attacking civilian targets . In short, the deaths of millions do matter, and although conventional airpower  possesses impressive speed and firepower, thermonuclear weapons , for good or ill, provide the ability in extremis to annihilate —more importantly, to thre
