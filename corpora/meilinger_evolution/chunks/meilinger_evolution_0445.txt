matter, and although conventional airpower  possesses impressive speed and firepower, thermonuclear weapons , for good or ill, provide the ability in extremis to annihilate —more importantly, to threaten  to annihilate—an enemy state. Just as warfare is the ultima ratio of international politics , so is nuclear attack  the final argument in warfare. Its very extremity has always made nuclear war  improbable, but the vast destructive potential of the absolute weapon still makes both the possibility of its use and the theories created to understand it important to both statesmen and strategists.
