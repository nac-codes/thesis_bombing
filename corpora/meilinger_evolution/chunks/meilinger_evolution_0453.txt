led to the Small ICBM (“Midgetman”) program (later canceled) to produce a single-warhead missile to be carried by hardened, off-road mobile launch vehicles. 25. This pattern changed somewhat in the late 1980s with the arrival of the Trident D-5, the first SLBM with sufficient accuracy to attack hardened point targets such as missile silos, along with the deployment of ultra-accurate Pershing II IRBMs and ground launched cruise missiles (GLCM) in western Europe, which promised to increase the ability of the United States to destroy the USSR’s land-based nuclear systems in a first strike. (The deployment of the highly accurate, 10-MIRV-per-missile MX in vulnerable silos probably did little to reassure the Soviet leadership about American intentions.) The relatively small Soviet SLBM force remained unaffected, but this too would come under threat in the 1980s, as discussed below.THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 312  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 338 --- 26. One problem with this scheme was that the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) produced by the detonation of the multimegaton, enhanced X-ray radiation, exoatmospheric ABM warheads would have done considerable damage to electronic systems on the ground, including the ABM tracking radars themselves. 27. Subsequent proposals to build a less capable US ABM system to provide protection against an isolated, accidental Soviet missile launch or a small Chinese nuclear attack were deemed unworthy of the necessary investment. Exactly the same arguments would emerge in the late 1980s for constructing Global Protection against Limited Strikes (GPALS)—a smaller version of the missile defense envisioned in the Strategic Defense Initiative—using a constellation of “brilliant pebbles” orbital interceptor missiles. 28. The ABM Treaty actually allowed each party to construct two ABM sites (later amended to one site) to protect the national capital, as well as an ICBM base, each with no more than one hundred interceptor missiles.
