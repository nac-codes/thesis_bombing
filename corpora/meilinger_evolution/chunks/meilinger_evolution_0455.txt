The seemingly obvious point that one must weigh the value of going to war against the value of not doing so is absolutely essential to deterrence theory; however, it is often ignored by deterrence theorists who find it convenient to treat states’ satisfaction with the status quo as a constant instead of an important variable. 36. See, among others, Brodie, Strategy in the Missile Age . 37. For the classic explanation of the relationship between these concepts, see Snyder, chap. 1. 38. See, for example, ibid., 14–16; and J. David Singer, Deterrence, Arms Control, and Disarmament  (Columbus, Ohio: Ohio State University Press, 1962), 22–24. 39. See, for example, Patrick Morgan, Deterrence: A Conceptual Analysis (Beverly Hills, Calif.: Sage, 1977), 20–22; Robert Art and Kenneth Waltz, “Technology, Strategy, and the Uses of Force,” in Art and Waltz, eds., The Use of Force,  2d ed. (Lanham, Md.: University Press of America, 1983), 10. 40. The seminal presentation of such a broad perspective on deterrence can be found in Thomas W. Milburn, “What Constitutes Effective Deterrence?” Journal of Conflict Resolution  3 (1959): 138–45. Among the few works to have seriously addressed the use of positive incentives for deterrence are David Baldwin, “The Power of Positive Sanctions,” World Politics 24 (October 1971): 19–38; and Peter Karsten, “Response to Threat Perception: Accommodation as a Special Case,” in Klaus Knorr, ed., Historical Dimensions of National Security Problems  (Lawrence, Kans.: University Press of Kansas, 1976), 120–63.
