In addition to short-warning SLBM strikes against leadership and C 2 targets, some decapitation scenarios involved the possibility of detonating large nuclear weapons at exoatmospheric altitudes in order to maximize their EMP effects, which would damage or destroy unhardened electronic systems over an enormous area. See Ball, Can Nuclear War Be Controlled? 10–12. Today small, nonnuclear, microwave-generating electronic countermeasures (ECM) warheads are being developed for tactical weapons to produce localized EMP-like effects against enemy C 2 tar
