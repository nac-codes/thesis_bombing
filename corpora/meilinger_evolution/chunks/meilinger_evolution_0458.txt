led? 10–12. Today small, nonnuclear, microwave-generating electronic countermeasures (ECM) warheads are being developed for tactical weapons to produce localized EMP-like effects against enemy C 2 targets and other electronic systems. 49. French strategists refer to essentially the same concept as “proportional deterrence.” See Beaufre . Charles de Gaulle characterized it less abstractly as the ability “to tear off an arm” of the attacker. This principle clearly lay behind the British Chevaline SLBM warhead program in the 1970s, which was directed at enabling the single British SSBN on patrol during a crisis to destroy Moscow, in spite of the ballistic missile defenses deployed around that city, by firing all of its missiles at the Soviet capital. See Norris, Burrows, and Fieldhouse, Nuclear Weapons Databook, vol. 5, 110–12. On the Swedish nuclear program and its eventual abandonment, see Mitchell Reiss, Without the Bomb: The Politics of Nuclear Nonproliferation  (New York: Columbia University Press, 1988), chap. 2. 50. However, assured destruction is more robust than marginal cost deterrence because a threat to annihilate an enemy’s country is far lessMUELLER 315  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 341 --- sensitive to marginal changes in the amount of damage that one can inflict than is a threat to destroy only one or a handful of highly valued targets. Therefore, although nuclear deterrence by smaller powers is similar to that of the United States or Russia, a potentially important difference exists between the two classes of states with respect to considerations of crisis stability. 51.
