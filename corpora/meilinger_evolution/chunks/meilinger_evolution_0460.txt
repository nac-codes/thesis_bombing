For an argument that nuclear accidents are inevitable (along with much evidence that they are extremely unlikely), see Scott D. Sagan, The Limits of Safety: Organizations, Accidents, and Nuclear Weapons  (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1993). 56. For one example among a plethora, see Lewis A.
