For a critical overview of the debate and indictment of the wild exaggeration of the initial research results, see Russell Seitz, “In from the Cold: ‘Nuclear Winter’ Melts Down,” The National Interest 5 (Fall 1986): 3–17. 65. However, early LNOs were much less limited than many of those later developed following National Security Decision Memorandum (NSDM) 242. See Lynn E. Davis, Limited Nuclear Options,  Adelphi Papers, no. 121 (London: IISS, 1976); and Friedberg. 66.

Gray, “Nuclear Strategy: The Case for a Theory of Victory,” International Security  4 (Summer 1979): 54–87; idem and Keith Payne, “Victory Is Possible,” Foreign Policy  39 (Summer 1980): 14–27;  Paul Nitze, “Deterring Our Deterrent,” Foreign Policy 25 (Winter 1976–1977): 195–210; Walter Slocombe, “The Countervailing Strategy,” International Security  5 (Spring 1981): 18–27; Victor Utgoff, “In Defense of Counterforce,” International Security  6 (Spring 1982): 44–61; and Robert Jastrow, “Why Strategic Superiority Matters,” Commentary, March 1983, 27–32. See also Kahn, On Escalation . One should note that some prominent war-fighting theorists such as Colin Gray were relatively skeptical of escalation dominance and countervailing. For detailed analysis of the war-fighting school(s), see Charles L. Glaser’s excellent essay “Why Do Strategists Disagree about the Requirements of Strategic Nuclear Deterrence?” in Lynn Eden and Steven E.
