Miller, eds., Nuclear Arguments  (Ithaca, N.Y.: CornellTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 318  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 344 --- University Press, 1989), 109–71; and Glaser’s Analyzing Strategic Nuclear Policy  (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1990). 68. Indeed, in the 1980s, fears arose that even the most significant intrawar escalation threshold of all—that between conventional and nuclear war—might not be recognizable because attacks with powerful conventional weapons such as IRBMs with FAE warheads might be mistaken for nuclear detonations. 69. Among the defenders of MAD against the war-fighting critiques, see especially Robert Jervis, The Illogic of American Nuclear Strategy  (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1984); idem, The Meaning of the Nuclear Revolution;  Glaser, Analyzing Strategic Nuclear Policy;  and idem, “Why Do Strategists Disagree about the Requirements of Strategic Nuclear Deterrence?” 70. Many people offer this argument; perhaps the most prominent instance is in Nitze. See also Benjamin S. Lambeth, “The Political Potential of Soviet Equivalence,” International Security 4 (Fall 1979): 22–39; Barry Blechman and Robert Powell, “What in the Name of God Is Strategic Superiority?” Political Science Quarterly  97 (Winter 1982–1983): 589–602; and Glaser, Analyzing Strategic Nuclear Policy,  chap. 3. 71. Richard Pipes, “Why the Soviet Union Thinks It Could Fight and Win a Nuclear War,” Commentary,  July 1977, 21–34. One key but rarely addressed problem with the argument that the Soviets might be inclined to start a war, provided they could expect to fare better in it than would the United States, was that with both superpowers crippled, all leading powers in the postwar world would be anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, or both. On the larger issue of the problems of understanding an adversary’s goals and intentions, see Robert Jervis, Perception and Misperception in International Politics  (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1976
