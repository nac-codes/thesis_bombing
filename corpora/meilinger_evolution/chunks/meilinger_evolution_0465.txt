Jervis, The Meaning of the Nuclear Revolution, see title of chap. 3. 73. Jervis, “Deterrence Theory Revisited,” 299–300. 74. On offense-defense theory and its relationship to nuclear weapons, see Robert Jervis, “Cooperation under the Security Dilemma,” World Politics 30 (January 1978): 167–214; George H. Quester, Offense and Defense in the International System  (New York: Wiley, 1977); David Goldfischer, The Best Defense  (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1993); and Sean M. Lynn-Jones, “Offense-Defense Theory and Its Critics,” Security Studies  4 (Summer 1995): 660–91. 75. In practice, one can use weapons interactively to complicate matters. For example, one could use less accurate SLBMs to suppress enemy air defenses, thereby assisting bombers to attack hardened counterforce targets. 76. Finally, under the recent Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) II Treaty, Russia and the United States agreed to ban MIRVs on ICBMs and to reduce the maximum number of warheads per SLBM to four. 77. Other incentives for the ABM Treaty included the desire to avoid the expense of an intense arms race between offensive and defensiveMUELLER 319  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 345 --- capabilities and the political damage that such a competition might do to relations between the superpowers, even if effective strategic defenses proved to be a pipe dream. 78. Windows of opportunity are central to debates about the strategic implications of nuclear proliferation as well. For discussion of the concept, see Richard Ned Lebow, “Windows of Opportunity: Do States Jump through Them?” International Security  9 (Summer 1984): 147–86; and Dan Reiter, “Exploding the Powder Keg Myth: Preemptive Wars Almost Never Happen,” International Security 20 (Fall 199
