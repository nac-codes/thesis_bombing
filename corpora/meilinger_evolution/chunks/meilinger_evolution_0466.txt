In general, biological weapons represent a far more serious threat than do chemical weapons. See Thomas L. McNaugher, “Ballistic Missiles and Chemical Weapons: The Legacy of the Iran-Iraq War,” International Security 15 (Fall 1990): 5–34; and Steve Fetter, “Ballistic Missiles and Weapons of Mass Destruction,”  International Security 16 (Summer 1991): 5–42. One should also note that nuclear materials such as plutonium, highly toxic if inhaled or ingested, can also be used as poisons. As with so many facets of the nuclear revolution, Manhattan Project scientists had already foreseen such radiological weapons as early as 1941. See, for example, Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb,  510. 83. In Cooperation under Fire: Anglo-German Restraint in World War II (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1995), Jeffrey Legro argues that important organizational factors also discouraged the use of chemical warfare by both sides. 84.
