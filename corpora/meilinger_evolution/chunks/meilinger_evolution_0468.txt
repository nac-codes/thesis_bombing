its theory of airpower. As this essay demonstrates, to a large extent, the Air Force has ignored LIC  as much as possible, preferring to think of it as little more than a small version of conventional war . But LIC is not just conventional war  waged on a small scale. Rather, LIC  differs fundamentally from conventional war .

But after World War II , limited wars  began to absorb inordinate amounts of US blood and treasure. Further, after World War II the US Air Force  gained its independence  as a fighting arm, with the responsibility to develop appropriate airpower theory and doctrine .

In the second place, LIC  is so nondescriptive that it has become little more than the rubric for an incredible mélange o
