oint of view, but it was certainly not low in its intensity for the Filipinos. In the second place, LIC  is so nondescriptive that it has become little more than the rubric for an incredible mélange of activities. At one time or another, one could find in the low intensity stewpot a distinctive type of warfare (insurgency  and counterinsurgency ), tactics (guerrilla methods and terrorism), short-duration conventional military operations (referred to euphemistically as “peacetime contingency operations ”), diplomatic activities (peacemaking ), and police activities (peacekeeping ).3 To bring some order and sense to a chaotic situation, the Joint Chiefs of Staff  published  Joint Pub 3-07,  Doctrine for Joint Operations in Low Intensity Conflict .4 This document limited the LIC  playing field to (1) insurgency  and counterinsurgency , (2) combating terrorism, (3) peacekeeping , and (4) contingency operations . Although helpful in narrowing the field, the four categories remain too broad for the purposes of this analysis. Within the four categories of LIC , one subcategory— counterinsurgency —has remained particularly troublesomeTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 322  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 348 --- and relevant for airmen. The nature of insurgency  challenges nearly every facet of US airpower theory and makes the application of traditional airpower theory problematic. Thus, this analysis limits LIC  to the insurgency /counterinsurgency problem. Although clearly an artificial limitation, it is most useful for the purposes sought here. I have argued that insurgencies —particularly those whose strategies derive from the classic teachings of Mao Tse-tung and his many disciples—are fundamentally different from conventional wars .5 Called variously “people’s revolutionary wars” and somewhat later “protracted revolutionary wars,” insurgencies  are revolutionary civil wars that differ fundamentally from conventional warfare  in at least five ways. The first difference is
