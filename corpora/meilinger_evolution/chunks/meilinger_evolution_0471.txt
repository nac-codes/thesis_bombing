fighters, obtaining needed supplies, and providing funds. On the military side, the insurgent objective is to harass government forces; demonstrate the government’s inability to cope with insurgent forces ; and after gaining the upper hand, take on government forces in conventional battles to administer the  coup de grace. As Douglas Pike  has pointed out, this remarkable duality provides the insurgency  with a built-in advantage. The government under siege must win both the civilian and military struggles. The insurgent must win only one. Further, the government faces a dilemma in resource allocation. Concentrating on the civilian struggle risks defeat on the battlefield. Concentrating on the military struggle allows the civilian part of the insurgency  time to infiltrate deeper and more widely into the population and governmental structures, perhaps risking a bloodless coup. 7 Conventional warfare , of course, is a web of military and nonmilitary aspects—a basic Clausewitzian notion. Rarely in conventional warfare  do we find such a seamless web or such an interdependence between the two aspects. The third fundamental difference concerns the tactics used by insurgent military forces . Guerrilla tactics  are certainly not unique to insurgencies . They have been used by regular forces in large “conventional” wars  (Orde Wingate ’s Chindits in the China-Burma-India theater  in World War II ) and by partisan irregulars during the same sorts of conflicts (the Soviet partisans and the French Maquis operating behind German lines). These operations, however, remained ancillary to the main military effort. Insurgents  use guerrilla tactics  as their principal method of military operation—and do so out of necessity. Insurgents are the weak fighting the strong—those out of power fighting those in power. Insurgents are often outmanned and nearly always outgunned. Guerrillas negate superior government firepower by operating in small, dispersed groups that do not provide lucra
