Perhaps the most important document published during the 1950s was a three-volume analysis of the French effort compiled by the French high command. 18 These remarkable volumes contain captured Vietminh  documents describing ways by which their tactics could obviate superior enemy airpower 19 and the difficulty of interdicting an enemy who required few supplies and relied on a very primitive and easily repairable logistic  transportation system. 20 Finally, these volumes directly called into question the applicability of the central tenets of American airpower theory, which the French referred to in these volumes as “the extremist thesis of Douhetism .”21 The continuing problems in Southeast Asia  during the latter part of the decade and the election of John F. Kennedy  to the presidency in 1960 spurred more interest in insurgencies  in the professional literature. 22 This was particularly true at Air University , Maxwell AFB, Alabama , where a number of student research papers directly addressed issues relat
