rgets  or the ability to see tactical targets  and therefore conclude that air power is limited is to overlook the inherent flexibility of the air vehicle. There is no such thing as limitations or impossible conditions, only incorrect tactics or poor employment.‚Äù27 Articles concerning insurgency  in the professional journals from 1960 through 1964 also increased significantly as US involvement in Southeast Asia  deepened. Remarkably few, however, dealt with the use of airpower. Noted academics Peter Paret  and John W. Shy  published perhaps the most important article that provided insights into the philosophy and strategy of protracted revolutionary warfare . Appearing in the Marine Corps Gazette  in January 1962, it provided an authoritative  tour de force on insurgencies  and the problems one faced when combating them. 28 Unfortunately, the authors paid scant attention to airpower, and the article apparently received very little attention from Air Force  airmen. The Gazette  and the corps continued their interest in the subject with an article on how President Sukarno  crushed an insurgency  in Indonesia  during 1958 29 and with a four-part series on the struggle to put down the Huk insurgency .30 Although the Marine Corps  showed great interest in protracted revolutionary warfare , Air Force  airmen published very little on the subject in their own professional journals. In 1962 a member of the History Department faculty at the Air Force Academy published an article about the use of airpower against the Huks ,31 and in late 1963 the Air University Review carried a short article on using airpower to escort ground convoy movements in Vietnam .32 Beyond this meager showing, the Air Force  seemed either supremely uninterested in the subject or assumed that, in terms of airpower, protracted revolutionary warfare  was just conventional warfare  writ small.THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 330  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 356 --- The Official Response In spite of protr
