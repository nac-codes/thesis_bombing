strialized state. 42 Ironically, strategic bombing  advocates believed that their vindication lay in the two Linebacker  air campaigns  waged in 1972. In the first campaign, both strategic  and tactical uses of airpower  played a significant, perhaps even decisive, role in defeating the North Vietnamese “Easter offensive .” In December of that year, President Richard Nixon  turned airmen loose to bomb previously restricted targets—includingTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 334  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 360 --- targets in Hanoi  and Haiphong —in Linebacker 2 . Shortly after this concentrated 11-day bombing campaign, the North Vietnamese agreed to a cease-fire and the return of US prisoners of war—a clear sign to many airmen that, had the politicians turned airmen loose earlier, they could have completed the struggle in Vietnam  quickly and successfully. The Unofficial Response One of the earliest responses by an American airman came with the publication of an important book by Maj John Pustay , a member of the US Air Force Academy faculty. Pustay  devoted an entire chapter to air operations  in such conflicts, drawing heavily on the experiences of the British in Malaya , the French in Vietnam , and reports from US advisors in Vietnam . Pustay  paid particular attention to the nonfirepower missions. As to firepower missions, he explained why aircraft should be able to fly low and slow and why they would be well served to have a second crew member for spotting fleeting guerrilla targets  in difficult terrain.43 At about the same time that Pustay  published his book, the Aerospace Studies Institute  at Air University  completed a study on the French use of airpower against guerrilla  forces in Algeria between 1954 and 1964. Although far from exhaustive and relying on mostly secondary sources, the study did provide at least one prophetic insight when the authors noted, “If the cause of an insurgency  is not, or cannot be, erased, then the best military effort will pr
