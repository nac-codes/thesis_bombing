War College  student research paper of 1967 provided a more balanced view of airpower in counterinsurgent operations. Col Robert L. Hardie ’s study emphasized the dual nature of insurgent warfare  and the requirement to integrate military and nonmilitary counterinsurgent  operations. Drawing on the writings of insurgent war theorists  as well as the experience of the British in Malaya  and the French in Algeria , Hardie  provided considerable evidence that the proper use of airpower would depend upon the phase of insurgent operations. 47 Hardie ’s paper is significant, for it represents the first example of a serious attempt to link insurgency theory and experience directly to air operations . However, it was the only such example found in the US professional literature until the decade of the 1980s. As to the remainder of the 1960s, two other items in the professional periodical literature are worth noting. The first article, written by a civilian historian working at Headquarters SAC , touted the effectiveness of the B-52  bomber in countering guerrilla  forces. 48 The second, from Great Britain , provided the first indication in the literature that aircraft on the ground were particularly lucrative targets for guerrilla operations  and that this vulnerability would be a difficult problem to solve. 49 Although the professional journals contained few articles on airpower and protracted revolutionary warfare  and althoughTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 336  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 362 --- Air University  published little in the way of serious research on the subject, civilian publishing houses provided a number of books during the 1960s that should have made it clear to airmen that the kind of warfare waged in Vietnam  was very different from the nuclear  or conventional war  paradigms reflected in US Air Force doctrine . Unfortunately, these books dealt with airpower only tangentially. 50 If the response by American airmen in professional military journals
