This was a crucial point because “military actions by friendly units which kill or injure innocent civilians can lose the loyalty of an otherwise friendly village.” 61 Again, this reference pertains to classic insurgent theory  and the fact that both sides in anTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 338  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 364 --- insurgency  have the same center of gravity  (the people) and that their objective is to capture the support of the population.
