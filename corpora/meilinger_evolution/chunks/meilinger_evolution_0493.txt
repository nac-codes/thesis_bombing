hors also demonstrated large areas of consensus. First, virtually all agreed that increasing the legitimacy of the government under siege was the key to successful counterinsurgency . Accordingly, the government must secure the population from rebel threats and address the sources of insurgent dissatisfaction.68 To reach these goals, the government must cut across traditional lines of authority and responsibility to produce a mutually reinforcing interagency effort. Further, almost all the authors agreed that the military portion of the struggle must minimize lethality in order to minimize collateral damage . The objective of military operations is not so much to kill insurgents as it is to coerce them and destroy their political will. However, both Grant Hammond  and Cable  emphasized that counterinsurgency  is not some sort of sociopolitical experiment. Hammond  declared that we must see it for what it is—war, albeit very different from traditional notions of warfare. 69 Cable  reminded his readers of the “simple fact that once armed insurgency  has commenced, it becomes the functional equivalent of a total war  of national survival in which only one of the two contenders for power will be extant at war’s end.” 70 Airmen voiced considerable interest and consensus in the airpower technology  required in such conflicts. 71 They nearly universally agreed that very sophisticated aircraft with attributes suitable for employment in high-speed conventional warfare  are inappropriate and often ineffective in operations against enemy forces using guerrilla tactics , particularly in complex surface environments such as jungles. Jerome Klingaman  summed up the problem by saying that “visual, aerial reconnaissance  and surveillance  of the guerrilla operating area is most effective when conducted at low altitude (below 1500 feet) and at low speed (under 125 knots). The effectiveness of visual surveillance  deteriorates rapidly above these limits. Very few jet pilots actually
