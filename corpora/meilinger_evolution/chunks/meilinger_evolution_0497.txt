As one of the architects of the air campaign  against Iraq  in the Gulf War  and subsequently as the commandant of Air Command and Staff College  at Maxwell AFB , his stature as an authority on airpower theory has grown significantly, and his influence over an entire generation of Air Force  officers is enormous. 84 The Official Response With the introduction of a new basic doctrine  manual dated 16 March 1984, LIC  had all but disappeared, save for two generalized paragraphs on special operations . But much more positive actions that held the promise of developing a theory of airpower applicable to protracted revolutionary warfare quickly overwhelmed this “slow start.” In 1985 the Air War College ’s annual Airpower Symposium at Maxwell AFB  focused on LIC . Also in the mid-1980s, the Air Force  established a Center for Low Intensity Conflict  (which quickly became an Army–Air Force venture) and took part in a Joint Low Intensity Conflict Project  sponsored by the Army ’s Training and Doctrine Command . Each of these developments represented growing interest in the subject, although the latter two developments produced nothing useful in terms of airpower theory. 85 A major step forward was the publication in December 1990 of an Army–Air Force pamphlet devoted to LIC .86 It introduced the internal defense and development (IDAD)  strategy as the basis for all actions (military and civilian) within the LIC  arena and brought together most of the concepts generally agreed upon in the professional literature over the previous 30 years. The pamphlet, however, presents its subject at a level of abstraction that precludes specifics about the use of airpower. For example, appendix E, “A Guide to Counterinsurgency Operations,” includes only one sentence about airpower.87 The IDAD  strategy, which blends interdependent civil-military functions, was the most
