States Air Force (1992). The theory so painstakingly developed thus languished at lower levels in an obscure manual of operational doctrine —namely, the aforementioned AFM 2-11. 91 In fact, at one point the basic doctrine  of 1992 appears to contradict directly the theory promulgated in AFM 2-11. Specifically, AFM 2-11 notes that insurgents “have no heartland, no fixed industrial facilities, and few interdictable LOC ,”92 whereas AFM 1-1 declares that “any enemy with the capacity to be a threat is likely to have strategic vulnerabilities susceptible to air attack .”93 Conclusion US airmen have long been known for their fascination with technology  and the mental toughness required to press home a bombing attack against fierce resistance or to outduel an enemy fighter . But they have never been known for their academic inquisitiveness, their devotion to the study of the art of war, or their contributions to the theory of airpower. Instead, American airmen have remained “doers” rather than introspective “thinkers.” Nowhere was that more evident than in the US Air Force approach to the problem of protracted revolutionary warfare . Wedded to the concept of “atomic airpower ” (and its power to justify an independent Air Force ) during the 1950s and early 1960s, American airmen virtually ignored the problem of insurgent  warfare until they entered the Vietnam War .THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 346  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 372 --- After the United States  withdrew from Vietnam , bitter memories, confusion about the impact of strategic bombing  on the war’s end, disagreement over the very nature of the conflict, and the continuing Soviet threat  made it all too easy for US airmen to push the unsettled enigma of protracted warfare  into the background. Retreating to the familiar problems of strategic nuclear warfare  and conventional warfare  in Europe  seemed much more comfortable. But the problem would not go away.
