One sees the truth of this observation in the fact that sapper attacks on US air bases in South Vietnam destroyed 96 aircraft (about one and one-third fighter-wing equivalents)—nearly 33 percent more than those destroyed in air-to-air combat and nearly as many as destroyed by the vaunted North Vietnamese surface-to-air missile systems. Nor does the figure of 96 destroyed include aircraft damaged and other destruction accomplished by sapper attacks, which adversely affected air operations.
