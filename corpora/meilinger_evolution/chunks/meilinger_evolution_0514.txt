The Army–Air Force Center for Low Intensity Conflict produced 51 major studies between 1987 and the present writing. Only three pertained directly to airpower: Logistic Support for Low Intensity Conflict—An Air Force Perspective; Planning Considerations for the Combat Employment of Air Power in Peacetime Contingency Operations;  and A Security Assistance Example—The US Air Force and the African Coastal Security Program (Langley AFB, Va.: Center for Low Intensity Conflict, 1988, 1988, and 1989, respectively).

Early drafts of the manual contained extensive information about the peculiar nature of protracted revolutionary warfare and extensive comment about the employment of airpower in such conflicts.

What remains are vague references rather than explicit theory. 92. AFM 2-11, 9–10, par. 3-3b. 93.
