This particular assertion was inserted at the general-officer level over my objections. Interestingly, vol. 2 of the manual, which contains evidence for every doctrinal statement made in vol. 1, contains no evidence of any kind to support this particular assertion.DREW 355  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 381 --- Chapter 10 John Boyd and John Warden: Airpower’s Quest for Strategic Paralysis Lt Col David S. Fadok A strategist should think in terms of paralysing, not of killing. —B. H. Liddell Hart Since the advent of heavier-than-air flight in 1903, theorists have posited numerous schemes to exploit the inherent ability of aircraft to rise above the fray of the battlefield and go straight to the heart of an enemy nation. From seeds sown by the Italian pioneer Giulio Douhet , strategic airpower theory has steadily evolved throughout the twentieth century. Along the way, it has been fashioned by harsh lessons of war, advances in technology , and the visionary concepts of a few, select airmen. Two modern-day theorists, Col John Boyd , now deceased, and Col John Warden , now retired from the US Air Force , have significantly contributed to this evolutionary process. Although Boyd  does not offer an airpower theory per se, his thoughts on conflict have significant implications for the employment of airpower at all levels of war. In contrast, Warden  has developed an airpower theory but focuses primarily on the strategic application of the air weapon. This chapter summarizes and critiques each man’s thoughts as they pertain to strategic conventional airpower .1 Further, it identifies and explains the theoretical linkages and disconnects between the two and highlights their contributions to the evolution of airpower theory. Specifically, I contend that (1) Boyd ’s theory  of conflict and Warden ’s theory  of strategic attack share a
