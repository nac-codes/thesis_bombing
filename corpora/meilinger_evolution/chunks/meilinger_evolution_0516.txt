between the two and highlights their contributions to the evolution of airpower theory. Specifically, I contend that (1) Boyd ’s theory  of conflict and Warden ’s theory  of strategic attack share a theme common to most, if not all, theories of strategic airpower—the goal of defeating one’s adversary by strategic paralysis ; (2) their divergent thoughts on strategic paralysis  represent two 357  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 382 --- distinct traditions regarding the nature and purpose of theory; and (3) together, the paralysis theories of Boyd  and Warden represent a fundamental shift in the evolution of strategic airpower thought from an emphasis on economic warfare  to an emphasis on control warfare .2 To demonstrate these assertions, one must first define the concept of strategic paralysis . Seven years after the “war to end all wars,” Basil H. Liddell Hart  published the first of his many books on military strategy and modern-day war. Its clever title, Paris; Or the Future of War,  recalls the mythical defeat of Achilles by his opponent Paris, via the surgical strike of a well-aimed arrow. As the title further suggests, attacking enemy vulnerabilities (instead of strengths) could and should serve as the role model for the conduct of war in the years ahead. The killing fields of World War I  had certainly made Paris’s strategy preferable; the technologies  of flight and mechanization seemed to make it possible as well. Thus, the search began for those key vulnerabilities of an enemy nation that were crucial to its survival and protected by the sword and shield of its armed forces. Along the way, airpower theorists  reintroduced the notion of paralysis  into the lexicon of military strategy . These early air enthusiasts extolled the “third dimension” that the aerial weapon added to the battlefield. The airplane’s unique ability to rise above the fray of surface battle led many people to speculate that airpower could defeat an enemy nation and its arm
