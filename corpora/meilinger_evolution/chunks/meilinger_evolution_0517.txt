t the aerial weapon added to the battlefield. The airplane’s unique ability to rise above the fray of surface battle led many people to speculate that airpower could defeat an enemy nation and its armed forces by incapacitating—or paralyzing—the vulnerable war-making potential in the rear. Inflicting paralysis  through aerial attack upon the Achilles’ heel of the enemy nation seemingly promised decisive victory at significantly lower cost in terms of lives and treasure. To more clearly define the concept of strategic paralysis , one should examine the idea in light of the theoretical constructs developed by two preeminent military writers—the British strategist J. F. C. Fuller  and the German historian Hans Delbruck . Fuller ’s typology helps distinguish what strategic paralysis  is, while Delbruck ’s demonstrates what it is not. In The Foundations of the Science of War,  Fuller  sets out to examine the nature of war as a science, beginning his study by introducing the concept of the threefold order. He insistsTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 358  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 383 --- that this order is “a foundation so universal that it may be considered axiomatic to knowledge in all its forms.” 3 Since humans consist of body, mind, and soul, wars as human activities must be subject to a similar constitution. Adopting the threefold order as the framework for his military study, Fuller  posits three spheres of war—physical, mental, and moral. 4 Respectively, these spheres deal with destruction of the enemy’s physical strength (fighting power), disorganization of his mental processes (thinking power), and disintegration of his moral will to resist  (staying power). Fuller  adds that forces operating within these spheres do so in synergistic, not isolated, ways: “Mental force does not win a war; moral force does not win a war; physical force does not win a war; but what does  win a war is the highest combination of these three forces acting as one force” (emphasis in
