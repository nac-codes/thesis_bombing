memorandum of 1928 to the chiefs of staff on the war object of an air force, Trenchard  explicitly states that the goal of air action is “to paralyse  from the very outset the enemy’s production centres of munitions of war of every sort and to stop all communications and transportation.” 16 He argues that paralyzing attacks upon an enemy’s “vital centres ” offer “the best object by which to reach victory” because they obtain “infinitely more effect” and “generally exact a smaller toll from the attacker” than strikes against the surface and air forces that defend them. Coincidentally, across the Atlantic, a man whom Trenchard  met and influenced on the western front  was airing similar views in a distinctly American manner. An outspoken advocate of airpower, Brig Gen Billy Mitchell also believed in strategic paralysis . In 1919 he asserted that aerial bombardment’s greatest value lay in “hitting an enemy’s great nerve centers at the very beginning of the war so as to paralyze  them to the greatest extent possible.”17 Six years later, during his well-publicized court-martial , Mitchell  spoke fondly of airpower’s unique ability to incapacitate one’s foes. Finally, in his last book, Skyways,  Mitchell  concludes that “the advent of airpower which can go straight to the vital centers  and entirely neutralize and destroy them has put a completely new complexion on the old system of war. It is now realized that the hostile main army in the field is a false objective and the real objectives are the vital centers . The old theory that victory meant the destruction of the hostile main army is untenable.” 18THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 362  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 387 --- Clearly, both Trenchard  and Mitchell  were early proponents of strategic paralysis . Their hauntingly similar writings proclaim the revolutionary nature of aerial warfare. The airplane possessed a unique ability to avoid the bloody stalemate on the ground and to combine shock and firepower into a
