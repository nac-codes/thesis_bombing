gly similar writings proclaim the revolutionary nature of aerial warfare. The airplane possessed a unique ability to avoid the bloody stalemate on the ground and to combine shock and firepower into a single weapon able to strike deeply into the enemy heartland. Given the substantial influence of Trenchard  and Mitchell  on their respective air services, the notion of paralysis became imbedded in the theoretical foundation of British and American strategic air doctrine , resurfacing most recently in the ideas of John Boyd  and John Warden . The tactical seeds of John Boyd ’s theory  of conflict were sown during the Korean War , when Boyd , a fighter pilot who flew the F-86 Sabre  in “MiG Alley ,” developed his first intuitive appreciation for the efficacy of what he would later refer to as “fast transient maneuvers .” Although the Soviet-built MiG-15 proved technologically superior to the F-86  in many respects, the latter’s hydraulic flight controls provided Sabre  pilots a decisive advantage over their opponents—the ability to shift more rapidly from one maneuver to another during aerial dogfights. Just when the MiG  pilot began reacting to the initial Sabre  movement, a rapid change in direction would render the enemy response inappropriate to the new tactical situation. This agility contributed to the Sabre  pilots’ establishment of an impressive 10-to-one kill ratio against the formidable MiG-15 . A few years later at Eglin AFB, Florida , Boyd  quantified these air-to-air combat lessons in the form of his energy maneuverability theory —a collection of tactical principles that still guides the training of Ameican fighter pilots. Yet, not until his retirement did Boyd  set out to expand his tactical concepts of aerial maneuver warfare  into a more generalized theory  of conflict.19 Beginning in 1976 with a concise, 16-page essay entitled “Destruction and Creation,” Boyd ’s strategic ideas evolved over the next decade into an unpublished, five-part series of briefi
