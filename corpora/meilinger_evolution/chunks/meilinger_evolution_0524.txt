of conflict.19 Beginning in 1976 with a concise, 16-page essay entitled “Destruction and Creation,” Boyd ’s strategic ideas evolved over the next decade into an unpublished, five-part series of briefings—“A Discourse on Winning and Losing.” Ironically, the “Discourse” itself is a product of the very process of analysis and synthesis described in “Destruction and Creation,” a cognitive process that Boyd  insists is crucial to prevailing in a highly unpredictable and competitive world. It is a form of mentalFADOK 363  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 388 --- agility, “a process of reaching across many perspectives; pulling each and every one apart (analysis), all the while intuitively looking for those parts of the disassembled perspectives which naturally interconnect with one another to form a higher order, more general elaboration (synthesis) of what is taking place.”20 Using the dialectic process of “Destruction and Creation,” Boyd  embarked upon an in-depth review of military history to unravel the mysteries of success and failure in conflict. Boyd ’s firm belief in fast transient maneuvers  instilled during his fighter days undoubtedly influenced this scholarly exercise. The end product is an eclectic and esoteric discourse on how to survive and win in a competitive world. Boyd ’s theory  of conflict advocates a form of maneuver warfare  that is more psychological and temporal in its orientation than physical and spatial. Its military object is “to break the spirit and will  of the enemy command by creating surprising and dangerous operational or strategic situations.” 21 To achieve this end, one must operate at a faster tempo or rhythm than one’s adversaries. Put differently, Boyd ’s maneuver warfare  aims to render the enemy powerless by denying him the time to cope mentally with the rapidly unfolding—and naturally uncertain—circumstances of war.22 One’s military operations aim to (1) create and perpetuate a highly fluid and menacing state of affairs
