mark of genius. 30 The mental images we construct are shaped by our personal experience, genetic heritage, and cultural traditions. They determine our decisions, actions, and observations. 31 Observations that match up with certain mental schemata call for certain decisions and actions. The timeliness and accuracy of those decisions and actions are directly related to our ability to orient and reorient correctly to the rapidly unfolding, perpetually uncertain events of war. Mismatches between the real world and our mental images of that world generate inaccurate responses. These, in turn, produce confusion and disorientation, which then diminish both the accuracy and the speed of subsequent decision making . Left uncorrected, disorientation steadily expands one’s OODA loop  until it eventually becomes a death trap. Tying the preceding comments together, Boyd  proposes that success in conflict stems from getting inside an adversary’s OODA loop  and staying there. The military commander can do so in two supplementary ways. First, he must minimize his own friction through initiative and harmony of response. This decrease in friendly friction acts to “tighten” his own loop (i.e., to speed up his own decision-action cycle time). Second, he must maximize his opponent’s friction through variety and rapidity of response. This increase in enemy friction acts to “loosen” the adversary’s loop (i.e., to slow down his decision- action cycle time). Together, these “friction manipulations” assure one’s continual operation within the enemy’s OODA loop  in menacing and unpredictable ways. Initially, this produces confusion and disorder within the enemy camp. Ultimately, it produces panic and fear that manifestFADOK 367  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 392 --- themselves in a simultaneous paralysis  of ability to cope and of willingness to resist. Using an analytical model developed by political scientist Robert Pape ,32 one can graphically depict Boyd ’s theory of strate
