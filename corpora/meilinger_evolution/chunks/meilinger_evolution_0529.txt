simultaneous paralysis  of ability to cope and of willingness to resist. Using an analytical model developed by political scientist Robert Pape ,32 one can graphically depict Boyd ’s theory of strategic paralysis  (fig. 2). As Boyd  himself would admit, his theory  of conflict is quite esoteric. He speaks of dismembering the “moral-mental-physical being” of the enemy and of getting inside his “mind-time-space,” yet he offers few, if any, operational details about accomplishing these abstract aims. The absence of detail is particularly frustrating for the practically minded war fighter whose profession centers on translating relatively obscure political ends into concrete military ways and means. Although Boyd ’s purpose is not to frustrate, neither is it to dictate. As he tells it, John Boyd  is a believer in theories, not theory— in doctrines, not doctrine. 33 He refuses to advocate any one approach, any one formula; following a single path to victory makes one predictable and vulnerable. Moreover, through the study of all theories and doctrines, the warrior accumulates a full bag of strategic tricks. Then, as a particular conflict unfolds, he can pick and choose from this bag as the situation demands. So, although Boyd ’s work is void of practical recipes for success, it is so by design. 34 A more appropriate critique of his discourse on winning and losing lies elsewhere. Ironically, one of the greatest strengths of Boyd ’s theory is, at the same time, a potential weakness—his emphasis on the temporal dimension of conflict. Reflecting an American bias for fast-paced operations and the related preference for short wars, Boyd  presumes  that operating at a faster tempo than one’s opponent matters—or, more to the point, that it matters THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 368  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 393 --- to the enemy. He may not care that we are “OODA looping ” more quickly. Indeed, it may be in his interest to refuse to play by our rules. To illustrate this p
