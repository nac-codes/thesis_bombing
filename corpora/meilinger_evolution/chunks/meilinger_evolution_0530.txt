To illustrate this point, I turn to the game of basketball. If our opponent is not particularly suited to a “fast break” style of play, it is in his interest to slow things down if we are a “run and gun” team. If he refuses to play at our faster pace and intentionally tries to slow things down, he may succeed in taking us out of our game just enough to win—even if we retain a relative advantage in speed throughout. Boyd  would no doubt argue that the fast-breaking side will paralyze  its opponent because of its quicker tempo, a point that may be true in some instances. It is certainly true if the naturally slower opponent agrees to speed things up. If, however, he slows the pace down, knowing full well that our fans will tolerate nothing other than fast-break ball, he may sufficiently frustrate our game plan so that, in the end, he wins. This basketball analogy seems to apply even better when, as in war, we remove the time clock. In fact, Mao Tse-tung  advocated precisely this approach as the strategy for liberating China  from the scorch of the Rising Sun in the War of Resistance against Japan . In contrast to both the subjugationists within the Kuomintang government and the theorists of quick victory within his own Communist Party , Mao  proposed the notion of “protracted war ” as the way for defeating the militarily superior Japanese aggressors. In a series of lectures from 26 May to 3 June 1938, Mao explained and justified his plans for protracted war  against Japan , couching his descriptions and arguments in the traditional Eastern dialectic of yin  and yang. For Mao , this Taoist “duality of opposites” informed not only the object of war but also the strategy for war. He argued that in war, one seeks to destroy the enemy and preserve oneself. 35 This twofold object “is the essence o
