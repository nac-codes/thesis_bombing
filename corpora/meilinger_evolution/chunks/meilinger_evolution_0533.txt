more political than economic in nature. Targeting  enemy leadership to produce desired policy changes is the overarching aim that should guide the employment of air forces. In this respect, Warden acknowledges an intellectual debt to the British military theorist J. F. C. Fuller . One of Fuller ’s classic works, The Generalship of Alexander the Great,  convinced him of the efficacy of attacking the command element as a means of defeating armed forces—a strategy of incapacitation through “decapitation .” While a student at the National War College , Warden  began to construct his theory of airpower. An academic thesis, originally planned as an examination of Alexander ’s genius, evolved instead into The Air Campaign: Planning for Combat . An influential text on the use of airpower in war, this book focuses on translating national political objectives and strategic military goals into theater campaign plans, with primary focus on planning airpower’s contribution to the overall effort. The book reflects the unique heritage of American air theory and practice. Warden ’s belief in the predominant role of air superiority  flows directly from the pages of the Army ’s Field Manual (FM) 100-20, Command and Employment of Airpower (1943). Likewise, his emphasis on air strikes  against enemy centers of gravity  recalls the writings of Billy Mitchell  and his kindred spirits at ACTS  with regard to attacks against “vital centers ” deep within the enemy heartland. 39 The main theme of The Air Campaign  is that airpower possesses a unique capacity to achieve the strategic ends of war with maximum effectiveness and minimum cost.

Central to this theme is the Clausewitzian concept of an enemy’s COG , defined by Warden  as “that point where the enemy is most vulnerable and the point w
