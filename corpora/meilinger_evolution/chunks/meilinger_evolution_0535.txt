ties into five component parts. 44 The most crucial element of the system—the innermost ring—is leadership. Extending outward from the center, in descending importance to the overall functioning of the system, are the rings of organic essentials, infrastructure, population, and fielded forces. 45 Within each ring exists a COG  or collection of COGs  that represents “the hub of all power and movement” for that particular ring. If the COG  is destroyed or neutralized, the effective functioning of the ring ceases, which affects theTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 372  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 397 --- entire system in more or less significant ways (depending upon whether it is an inner or outer ring). To facilitate the accurate identification of these key hubs within each ring, Warden  proposes the further breakdown of any given ring into five subrings (of leadership, organic essentials, etc.) and these into five more, if necessary, until the true COG  surfaces. The central theme of the five-rings model  is that the most effective strategic plan  always focuses on leadership, first and foremost. Even if leadership is unavailable as a target set, the air strategist  must still focus on the mind of the commander when selecting COGs  among the other rings. 46 Within these rings lie COGs  that, when hit, impose some level of physical paralysis , thereby raising the costs of further resistance in the mind of the enemy command.47 The implicit message is that destruction or neutralization of the leadership COG (s) produces total physical  paralysis  of the system, whereas successful attack upon COGs  within the other rings produces partial physical paralysis  but unbearable psychological pressure upon the leadership. When Iraq  invaded Kuwait  in August 1990 and US military planners  considered possible responses, Warden ’s Checkmate Division  developed an air option. Firmly believing in the efficacy of striking enemy COGs , he resurrected the five-rings FADOK 373  File:
