John Boyd  and John Warden . Both men contend that the target for all military action should be the enemy command and that the most effective and efficient mechanism for translating military expenditure into political gain is paralysis  of that command. Although they may share certain fundamental beliefs about the proper conduct of war, Boyd and Warden  diverge sharply in theoretical approach. Their distinct approaches represent two traditions regarding the nature and purpose of theory, best personified by two nineteenth-century theorists of war—Antoine Henri Jomini and Carl von Clausewitz . The Jominian tradition believes that one can reduce the practice of war (i.e., its strategy ) to a set of general principles or rules for scientific derivation and universal application. It recognizes that the nature of war may change due to political and/or moral variables but that the conduct of war is constant and governed by principles. For Jominians, theory uncovers these immutable truths and advocates their adoption and use. In the words of Jomini  himself, “Convinced that I had seized the true point of view under which it was necessary to regard the theory of war in order to discover its veritable rules  . . . I set myself to the work with the ardor of a neophyte” (emphasis added). 64 The Jominian school acknowledges that the nature of war is complex and dramatic and that, consequently, its complete mastery is truly an art form. However, the strategy  of war is scientific, knowable, constant, and governed by principles of eternal validity. Borrowing a concept from the emerging science of chaos and complexity, one notes that Jominians are predominantly “linear” thinkers regarding the conduct of war.FADOK 379  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 404 --- They believe in a certain causality or predictability of actions taken in war. That is, they believe that similar inputs produce similar outputs. Translated into the language of strategy , if a given plan of attack i
