the midst of war’s fog and friction. The Clausewitzian  school seeks to permanently arm the military commander with genius, which the Prussian himself defined as “a very highly developed mental aptitude for a particular occupation.” In the profession of war, this mental aptitude represents a psychological strength that entails a harmonious balance of intellect and temperament and allows one to function in the presence of uncertainty. Furthermore, one can develop this aptitude: “That practice and a trainedTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 380  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 405 --- mind have much to do with it is undeniable.” 69 Thus, Clausewitzians  share the belief that one can define and should teach the genius of war—a cherished conviction similar to the Jominian  belief in the principles of war. Evaluating our theorists of strategic paralysis  in this light, we note that Warden ’s thoughts are predominantly Jominian in their character, content, and intent, while Boyd ’s are predominantly Clausewitzian . Warden ’s theory of swift, simultaneous attack against the enemy’s physical form, as depicted by the five-rings model , is practical, concrete, and linear. He prescribes direct and/or indirect attack upon the enemy leadership as the way to impose one’s will in a world of conflict. Though one may want to vary one’s tactical approach, if a “bullet through the brain” has worked once, it will always work; therefore, it should remain the strategic aim of military operations. 70 In addition, Warden ’s representation of combat effectiveness as the multiplicative product of physical and moral strength allows him to focus on the tangible variable in the equation to the exclusion of the intangible one. Decimating the enemy’s physical capability renders his moral strength irrelevant. Thus, in both the practice and the theory  of war, emphasis on the physical sphere is understandable, acceptable, and— indeed—preferable. In contrast, Boyd ’s theory of maneuvering inside the en
