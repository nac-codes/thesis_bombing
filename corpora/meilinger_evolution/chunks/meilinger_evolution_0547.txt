onomic warfare  to paralysis  via control warfare . As the twentieth century passed its midpoint, the modern world began a slow metamorphosis from an industrial society to an informational society. Fueled by steady advances in computer and communications technologies , this tra nsfiguration continues today. Interestingly, methods of aerial warfare appear to be changing in parallel. Boyd  and Warden  stand as transitional figures in this evolution of strategic airpower theory. Although paralysis  remains the common underpinning for all twentieth- century thought on the subject, the theoretical transformation represented by Boyd  and Warden  is one from economic warfare based on industrial targeting  to control warfare  based on informational targeting . In the first half of airpower’s inaugural century, strategic air doctrines  that evolved in both Great Britain  and the United States  were fashioned by the theory  of strategic paralysis  and a belief that one best induced incapacitation of a hostile nation and its armed forces by striking directly at the enemy’s economic, war-making potential. RAF  strategic bombardment doctrine  reflected the man in charge from 1919 until 1928—Air Marshal Sir Hugh Trenchard , whose air policy aimed to bring about the disintegration and collapse of the enemy’s war economy. In the last of his 10 years as air chief, he produced perhaps the clearest statement of his beliefs on air warfare  in the form of a memorandum to his fellow service chiefs. In it, Trenchard  proposed the following war object for the RAF : “The aim of the Air Force is to break down the enemy’s means of resistance by attacks on objectives selectedTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 382  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 407 --- as most likely to achieve this end.” He went on to specify these military objectives as the enemy’s “vital centres ” of production, transportation, and communication from which the enemy sustains his war effort. 72 Trenchard  highlighted the moral
