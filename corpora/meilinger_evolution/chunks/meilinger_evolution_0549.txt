ming the “shank of the drill” into a closely knit industrial web requiring precision bombardment  to unweave it.75 They did not discount the potentially incapacitating effects on morale  that such precise bombing might provide as the natural consequence of economic deprivation. However, the instructors primarily focused (publicly, at least) on the physical paralysis  induced by precise industrial targeting , as opposed to the BritishFADOK 383  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 408 --- emphasis on the physical and psychological paralysis  of economic area bombing. Both the British and the American versions of economic warfare  through strategic air attack  would be severely tested after Germany ’s lightning strikes into Poland  and France ignited World War II . The end of that war coincided with the dawn of the Information Age . Alvin and Heidi  Toffler contend that this information revolution  will transplant the industrial revolution  of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and transform both wealth creation and war making accordingly. 76 Although theorists did not completely dismiss the notion of strategic paralysis  through economic warfare , a new form of incapacitation warfare  held great promise—control warfare against an enemy’s systems of governance and information processing.77 John Boyd  is one contemporary theorist who focuses on paralysis  through control warfare .78 More specifically, he concentrates on disorienting the mind of the enemy command by disrupting the process for exercising command and control (C2). Boyd  represents this process in the form of the OODA loop .79 As we have seen, one ensures victory in conflict by securing a temporal advantage  over one’s opponent in transiting the OODA loop , which in turn produces a psychological paralysis  of his decision-making and action-taking processes. In addition to being a governance loop, the OODA  model represents the process of information collection, analysis, and dissemination.
