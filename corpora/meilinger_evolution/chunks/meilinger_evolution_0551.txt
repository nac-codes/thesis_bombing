may spin wildly out of control, 81 suggesting that information linkages between rings may present the key to taking down the entire enemy system. Together, Boyd  and Warden  have transformed paralysis theory  as it pertains to strategic conventional airpower . They have shifted the focus from war-supporting industry to war-supporting command—from economic warfare  to control warfare . Yet, Boyd  and Warden  do not represent the end of the road. As many futurists predict, the information revolution will continue to affect how governments and their militaries wage war. Former RAF  Marshal Sir John Slessor  once wrote, “If there is one attitude more dangerous than to assume that a future war will be just like the last one, it is to imagine that it will be so utterly different that we can afford to ignore all the lessons of the last one.” 82 One of the foremost lessons of applying strategic airpower  in the Persian Gulf War  of 1991 was the efficacy of information dominance .83 By destroying Iraq ’s eyes, ears, and mouth and by exploiting their own surface- and aerospace-based data platforms, coalition forces  quickly established a form of information superiority  that may have been as decisive as the more traditional control of the air. The increasing dependence of modern war-fighting machines upon efficient information-processing systems will continue to create opportunities to deny, disrupt, and manipulate the collection, analysis, and dissemination of battlefield information. 84 Therefore, one may reasonably suggest thatFADOK 385  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 410 --- future wars will resemble Desert Storm  in at least one important respect—the strategic and operational pursuit of information dominance  via control of the war-fighting “datasphere.” 85 RAND ’s John Arquilla  and David Ronfeldt  have termed these future battles for information dominance  “cyberwar .” As they define it, cyberwar  refers to conducting, and preparing to conduct, military op
