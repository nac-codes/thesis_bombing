’s John Arquilla  and David Ronfeldt  have termed these future battles for information dominance  “cyberwar .” As they define it, cyberwar  refers to conducting, and preparing to conduct, military operations according to information-related principles. It means disrupting if not destroying the information and communications systems, broadly defined to include even military culture, on which an adversary relies in order to “know” itself. . . . It means trying to know all about an adversary while keeping it from knowing much about oneself. It means turning the “balance of information and knowledge” in one’s favor, especially if the balance of forces is not. 86 In a sense, Arquilla  and Ronfeldt  are speaking of inducing strategic paralysis  by attacking (physically and/or electronically) key information-related centers of gravity , be they nodes or connections. Future advances in command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C 4I) technologies and their integration with weapons-delivery platforms promise to increase the tempo of twenty-first-century warfare. 87 Friendly and enemy OODA loops  will “tighten” enormously as one collects, analyzes, disseminates, and acts upon battlefield information within a matter of minutes—not days. As a result, controlling the datasphere will become a top priority in most, if not all, future conflicts since “defeating the collection or dissemination of the information [upon which “shooters” so depend for effective strikes] will be tantamount to destroying the attacking platform itself.” 88 Achieving information dominance  will become key to military victory, since it will provide both the means to remain oriented and the opportunity to disorient the enemy. In this way, one can obtain relative advantages in the speed and accuracy of the OODA  process. Although the information revolution  may not affect the process  of decision making  as described by Boyd , it threatens to fundamentally alter the form  of the enemy sys
