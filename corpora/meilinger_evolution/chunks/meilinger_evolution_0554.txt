oblem-solving,” 92 will add a great deal of credence to John Boyd ’s notion of noncooperative COGs . Control warfare based on lateral cooperation targeting may indeed replace control warfare  based on top-down command targeting as the paralysis  “strategy of choice” in the twenty-first century. Yet, as the Tofflers  point out, all future warfare  will not be exclusively “third wave,” or information, warfare . That is to say, “first wave” (agrarian) and “second wave” (industrial) war forms will not disappear with the emergence of the Information Age . Instead, we will observe that “every large-scale conflict will be distinguished by a characteristic combination of these war-forms. Put differently, each war or battle will have its own ‘wave formation’ according to how the three types of conflict are combined.” 93 Thus, although the future of strategic paralysis  theory  may lie in the concept of control warfare  ushered in by Boyd  andFADOK 387  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 412 --- Warden , actual plans  to incapacitate an adversary may themselves remain “characteristic combinations” of the three war forms of paralysis  discussed above—economic warfare based on industrial targeting , control warfare  based on vertical command targeting, and control warfare  based on lateral information targeting . Though experiencing a renaissance in the wake of Desert Storm , the notion of strategic paralysis  has been around for quite some time. The nonlethal intent of incapacitating (instead of annihilating or attriting) the enemy sprang quite forcefully from the carnivorous trenches of World War I . Airpower’s first major war was one of mankind’s bloodiest and most senseless. Unsurprisingly, then, air veterans of that war heeded the strategic call to “think in terms of paralysing, not of killing.” 94 Two modern-day airmen, John Boyd  and John Warden , have done just that. As I have explained, Boyd ’s thoughts are process  oriented and aim at psychological  paralysis
