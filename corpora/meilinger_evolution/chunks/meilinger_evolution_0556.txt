of teaching warriors how to act—that is, teaching the principles of war. The ideas of Boyd  and Warden  complement each other and, together, have helped usher in the era of inflicting strategic paralysis  by means of control warfare . Although this general war form may become predominant in the Information Age , specific targeting schemes may need to vary somewhat. Thus, as always, the practical application of airpower theory must remain flexible and responsive. Tomorrow’s airmen should remain forever mindful of the Tofflers ’ warning that first- and second-wave war forms do not disappear in the era of third-wave conflict. Caveats aside, if twenty-first-century technologies  ever enable nonlethal capability to match nonlethal intent, then the strategic paralysis  theories of John Boyd  and John Warden  may offer the guidance necessary for effective and efficient operations inside the loops and rings of first-, second-, and third-wave adversaries who threaten us. Notes 1. In this respect, the works of Boyd and Warden represent a resurgence in strategic conventional  airpower theory. As Col Phillip Meilinger argues, the three decades of airpower prior to Operation Desert Storm witnessed the diminished doctrinal significance of strategic conventional airpower. He cites two primary reasons for this phenomenon: (1) the organizational rise of tactical airpower in the era of limited war and (2) the identification of strategic airpower with nuclear weapons in the age of the atom.

RAND’s John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt have coined the term cyberwar  to describe the nature of future conflict. The prefix cyber  comes from the Greek root kybernan,  meaning to steer or govern. They contend that cyberwar  is a more encompassing term than information warfare  since “it bridges the fields of information and governance better than does any other available pref
