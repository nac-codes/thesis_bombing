steer or govern. They contend that cyberwar  is a more encompassing term than information warfare  since “it bridges the fields of information and governance better than does any other available prefix or term.” A RAND colleague, Denise Quigley, offers the German term Leitenkrieg,  which roughly means control warfare. I prefer the latter term to describe the content of Boyd’s and Warden’s theories of strategic paralysis. 3. J. F. C.

Interestingly, Fuller’s three spheres bear notable resemblance to Clausewitz’s famed trinity of armed forces (physical), government (mental), and population (moral). 5. Fuller, 146. 6. Nonlethal intent distinguishes paralysis from more traditional strategies of annihilation. For a differing opinion, see Maj Jason B. Barlow, “Strategic Paralysis: An Airpower Strategy for the Present,” Airpower Journal 7, no. 4 (Winter 1993): 4–15. He contends that the difference between paralysis and annihilation is one of technological capability rather than politico-strategic intent. 7. David Shlapak writes of “indirect engagement” as a mode of attack whereby “the effect is meant to be felt primarily elsewhere than at the point of attack.” However, he defines paralysis as a “reduction in a combat force element’s capability  resulting from indirect engagement of that element” (emphasis added). In contrast, I view paralysis as a direct engagement of physical and mental capabilities so as to indirectly engage will.
