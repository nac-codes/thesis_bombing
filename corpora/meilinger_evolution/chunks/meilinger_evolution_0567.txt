nd the Nineteenth Century,” in The Theory and Practice of War,  ed. Michael Howard (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 1975), 13–14, 31. 66. In an extremely thought-provoking article, Alan Beyerchen argues that Clausewitz himself was a “nonlinear” thinker and that On War  is a classic exposé of the essential nonlinearity or unpredictability of battle.

Quoted in Webster and Frankland, vol. 4, 72. 73. Ibid., 73. Trenchard deplored “the indiscriminate bombing of a city for the sole purpose of terrorising the civilian population.” That said, he did focus heavily on the moral effects of strategic bombardment. The minutes of a meeting he chaired in July 1923 quote him as advocating “the policy of hitting the French nation and making them squeal before we did. . . . [This is] more vital than anything else” (page 67). Similarly, Air Staff memorandum 11A of March 1924 succinctly states that the proper employment of the RAF is “to bomb military objectives in populated areas from the beginning of the war, with the object of obtaining a decision by the moral effect which such attacks will produce and by the serious dislocation of the normal life of the country.” Col Phillip S.
