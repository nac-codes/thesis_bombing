ough the use of multiple cooperative (usually physically separated) problem solvers. Truly distributed problem solving must be contrasted with centralized problem solving with remote execution. In true distributed problem solving, no one element has access to all the information which will be used in the eventual solution. The essential issues involve the decomposition of problems, insuring cooperation among problem-solving elements, managing communications, and dynamically adjusting the system problem statements in response to changes in the situation.” Maj George E.

Winton* It is my conviction that the characteristics commonly associated with chamber music can be achieved in symphonic orchestras far more readily than is customarily imagined. It is a matter, first, of the excellence of the players themselves, and second of the manner in which they are trained to listen to what others are doing and to make their individual part contribute to the ensemble synthesis. —George Szell The era between the Vietnam War  and Operation Desert Shield  proved highly significant for all of America ’s armed forces but particularly for the Army  and the Air Force , both of which came out of Vietnam  with a mixed legacy. On the one hand, proponents could point to battlefield successes. On the other, both internal and external critics contended that the Army  and the Air Force  had failed to develop strategic and operational concepts that contributed to preservation of an independent, non-Communist Republic of Vietnam . These analysts argued that although part of the failure to achieve American political objectives
