at it said. This does not imply that the Air Force’s doctrine  has no active component or that the Army ’s has no theoretical content. Each is clearly a mix of both. Two distinct institutional preferences exist, however, and the divergence of these emphases was, in and of itself, a factor that complicated cross-service communication. Differing command echelons that developed each service’s most significant doctrine  also influenced Army–Air Force communications on doctrinal matters. The Air Force  doctrinal structure envisioned three levels: basic or fundamental doctrine , normally written at the Air Staff; operational doctrine , the responsibility of the major subordinate commands; and tactical doctrine , developed by a variety of schools and agencies. 7 Army doctrine  has a similar structure but remains more closely tied to its level of organization. At the top is capstone doctrine , the rough equivalent of Air Force basic  doctrine but, as we have seen, a much more explicit guide to practice than its Air Force  counterpart. Subordinate doctrine  addresses war-fighting and support concepts appropriate to corps, divisions, brigades, battalions, and ultimately even minor tactical units. The major difference between the Army  and the Air Force  after 1973 was that the Army  formed in that year a single organization—Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) — responsible for the development of virtually all its doctrine , from the capstone  manual to the lowest tactical  publication. Thus, the Army  had a powerful integrating agency that could, and did, make doctrine  the engine that drove the Army . This development directly reflected the personal philosophy of TRADOC ’s first, and arguably most dynamic, commander—Gen William E. DePuy . The more diffuse locus of doctrinal development in the Air Force reflected the anomaly that, LeMay ’s assertion to the contrary, doctrine  was a much more tangential concern in Air Force  than in Army  life. This  diffusion also created
