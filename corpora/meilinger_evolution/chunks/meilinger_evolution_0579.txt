evelopment in the Air Force reflected the anomaly that, LeMay ’s assertion to the contrary, doctrine  was a much more tangential concern in Air Force  than in Army  life. This  diffusion also created problems in institutional communication.THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 404  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 429 --- Both the Air Force  and the Army  recognized that the former’s Tactical Air Command (TAC) , which owned all US-based aircraft that flew CAS  and interdiction  missions, was the logical point of contact for interaction with TRADOC on doctrinal matters. Although the TAC -TRADOC  dialogue proved extraordinarily productive, it had two drawbacks.

This at times created frustration in the minds of Air Staff action officers, who, when approaching their Army  counterparts for coordination of doctrinal matters, received perplexed reactions that said, in effect, “Don’t bother me; that’s TRADOC ’s business.” 10 Despite the perceptional differences on the nature of doctrine  itself and distinctly divergent institutional arrangements for the formulation thereof, one actually finds a significant amount of cooperation between the two services during the era between Vietnam  and Desert Shield . That story begins with the development of the Army ’s Active Defense doctrine , published in 1976.
