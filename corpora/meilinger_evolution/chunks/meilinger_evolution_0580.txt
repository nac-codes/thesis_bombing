Three dynamics drove the 1976 edition of FM 100-5: the reorientation of the American national security  focus from Indochina  to Europe ; the increased range, accuracy, and lethality of direct-fire weapons evident in the Middle East War of 1973; and General DePuy ’s personal energy and determination.

Clothed in a camouflage cover; replete with numerous charts, graphs, and diagrams; written in a simple, direct style; and printed with the liberal use of eye-catching bold-and-italic, black-and-brown type; this manual was clearly designed to grab and hold the reader’s attention. The second paragraph of the opening chapter contained the clear imperative that “today the US Army  must, above all else, prepare to win the first battle of the next war”  (emphasis in original).13 The entire second chapter provided a discourse on the effects of modern weapons that graphically depicted their increased range and lethality from World War II  to the Middle East War  of 1973. The chapter’s most arresting state
