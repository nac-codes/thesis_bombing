8, “Air-Land Battle,” the second paragraph of which explicitly addressed the Army ’s dependence upon the Air Force : “Both the Army and the Air Force  deliver firepower against the enemy. Both can kill a tank. Both can collect intelligence , conduct reconnaissance , provide air defense , move troops and supplies, and jam radios and radar. But neither the Army  nor the Air Force  can fulfill any one of those functions completely by itself. Thus, the Army  cannot win the land battle without the Air Force ” (emphasis in original). 19 This analysis paid particular attention to the suppression of Warsaw Pact  air defenses , asserting that “whenever and wherever the heavy use of airpower is needed to win the air-land battle, the enemy air defenses  must be suppressed” (emphasis in original). 20 The manual depicted this suppression as a joint effort that required the integration of the intelligence  and strike capabilities of both services. It cautioned, however, that even with the best of air defense suppression, the Air Force , in a future European battle against the Warsaw Pact , would not be able to provide the unopposed CAS  to which the Army  had become accustomed in its three previous wars. In short, the Army ’s 1976 doctrinal prescription for a future war  in Europe  clearly recognized cooperation with the Air Force  as a tactical and institutional imperative. Air Force basic  doctrine in the period 1973–79 does not reflect a similar sense of commonality. The 1975 edition of AFM 1-1 was a bland document that reflected the desire of Air Force  leadership for a manual that “more accurately and fully restates the role and purpose of USAF aerospace power, relating [it] more directly to national policy  and national security strategy .”21 In other words, the manual sought to demonstrate the Air Force ’s relevance in the post-Vietnam  era. It listed eight combat operational missions: strategic attack , counterair , AI, CAS , aerospace defense of the United States ,WINTO
