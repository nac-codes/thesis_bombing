Desert Shield . The origin of the A-10  goes back to the late 1960s, when Air Force planners , based on requirements evident in the Vietnam War , developed preliminary specifications for an ideal CAS platform. Criteria included the ability to operate from short, unimproved airstrips; high reliability and ease of maintenance; capacity to carry large amounts of tank-killing ordnance; long loiter time; 350-knot speed with high maneuverability; survivability for both pilot and plane in the face of heavy air defenses ; and low cost.25 But how could one kill tanks with air-delivered munitions? The A-10  answered that question with its 20-feet-long, four-thousand-pound, seven-barrel Gatling gun that fired three to four thousand rounds of 30 mm armor-piercing ammunition per minute. 26 Two quiet, reliable General Electric turbofan engines canted upwards near the rear of the fuselage enhanced the plane’s survivability. A titanium “bathtub” that shrouded the cockpit enhanced the pilot’s survivability. Although slightly underpowered and ungainly, the “Warthog” was a ground-attack pilot’s dream. From the Army ’s point of view, fielding the A-10  not only underscored the Air Force ’s commitment to the CAS  mission, it also created a corpus of pilots whose whole professional being centered around providing that support.WINTON 409  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 434 --- The Air Force ’s analytical focus began to shift toward the problems of a European war in the mid-1970s. In late 1974, RAND  produced a study that examined the implications of air-and ground-delivered precision-guided munitions (PGM) for the defense of NATO .27 The report concluded that PGMs might “add to the ‘glue’ of NATO  and create problems for Pact strategists.” 28 In late 1975, RAND  completed a study that examined the relative merits of additional manned aircraft, remotely piloted vehicles , and standoff munitions  for improving air-ground capability in NATO .29 The study concluded that for an in
