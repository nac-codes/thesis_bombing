that examined the relative merits of additional manned aircraft, remotely piloted vehicles , and standoff munitions  for improving air-ground capability in NATO .29 The study concluded that for an investment of $1 billion over 10 years, CAS  standoff munitions  launched by A-10s  would kill the most armor and that terminally guided standoff munitions would kill the most enemy aircraft on the ground. 30 In May 1976, the Air Force  sponsored a two-day conference at RAND ’s offices in Santa Monica, California, to explore in some detail exactly how the Warsaw Pact  ground forces might attack NATO .31 Presenters included analysts from the Central Intelligence Agency , the Army ’s Combined Arms Combat Development Activity  (a TRADOC  agency), and RAND . Representatives from the Air Staff’s Directorate of Plans and Operations and the USAF Fighter Weapons Center  (a TAC agency) at Nellis AFB, Nevada , also attended. Issues addressed included how the war might start, principal attack axes, the primacy of the offensive in Soviet doctrine , Soviet concepts and tactics, logistical support, air defenses , and chemical warfare  capabilities. One presenter opined that Soviet forces arrayed in East Germany  consisted of 31–32 divisions organized into five armies, possibly augmented by 26 additional Warsaw Pact  divisions. 32 Other RAND  studies requested by the Air Force  included a 1978 analysis of the effects of weather on battlefield air support in NATO  and a 1979 assessment of the potential vulnerabilities of Warsaw Pact  forces to attacks against their tactical rear areas. 33 The main conclusion one draws from these analyses is that in the early post-Vietnam  years, the Air Force  took its mission to support the Army  in a European war very seriously indeed and engaged in a comprehensive effort to determine how best to accomplish this mission.THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 410  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 435 --- The most obvious institutional arrangement that reflected
