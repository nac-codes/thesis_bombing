the reserves (which also acted as a prophylactic against the Army  being called to war in the future without a reserve call-up) and (2) cut manpower at command levels above the division. Ergo, the field army as an organizational echelon disappeared. 42 The field army headquarters, however, had served as the nexus of air-ground cooperation  in both World War II  and Korea . The most famous example of this cooperation was the virtual marriage between Lt Gen George Patton ’s Third Army and Brig Gen O. P. Weyland ’s XIX Tactical Air Command .43 The fundamental precept that emerged from this relationship held that each field army would receive support from a colocated tactical air command that worked for the theater air commander but whose raison d’être was assisting the supported ground commander in the accomplishment of his mission. In January 1974, the Air Staff surfaced the problem to the Army  Staff, from which a proposal emerged for the establishment of an Army  tactical air support liaison element located at the air force component commander ’s tactical air control center (TACC) .44 This arrangement proved insufficient, however, to provide detailed tactical coordination between ground and air formations; and in January 1976 DixonTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 412  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 437 --- notified DePuy  that the situation required more work, particularly when multiple corps deployed in a single theater. 45 The proposal that emerged from these discussions entailed retaining an Army  element at the TACC , now redesignated the battle coordination element (BCE)  but supplementing this with a robust Air Force  liaison element at each corps headquarters, tentatively designated a tactical air coordination element (TACE) . The Blue Flag  exercise of December 1977 tested this arrangement.46 In January 1978, TRADOC  published its analysis of this exercise in an air-land forces interface study, which concluded that the TACE  provided adequate representation t
