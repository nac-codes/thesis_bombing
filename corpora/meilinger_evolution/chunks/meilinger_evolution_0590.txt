977 tested this arrangement.46 In January 1978, TRADOC  published its analysis of this exercise in an air-land forces interface study, which concluded that the TACE  provided adequate representation to the corps and that the BCE  provided adequate Army  representation to the TACC .47 Two anomalies, however, surfaced in this report. The first was that it envisioned individual corps commanders communicating directly with the air component commander regarding the redistribution of sorties among the corps— clearly not a position the Air Force  relished. 48 The second was that it did not represent the opinion of corps commanders in NATO , who felt that mere liaison at the corps level was not enough—that the corps battle required much more detailed interface with the Air Force  than a liaison party could provide. 49 Both of these issues derived from the demise of the field army, and both continued to bedevil Army  and Air Force planners  in the years ahead. In surveying the formation of the Army –Air Force partnership during the early post-Vietnam  years, one must also consider the development of Army  attack helicopters . During the Vietnam War , the Army  had developed the AH-1 Cobra , an attack variant of the ubiquitous “Huey.” Clearly, however, the Cobra  had neither the lethality nor the survivability to fight successfully in central Europe . Hence, the Army  embarked on an ambitious program to design a new generation of attack helicopter  from the ground up, resulting in the AH-64 Apache .50 The Apache’s  lethality derived from eight laser-guided Hellfire missiles , a 30 mm chain gun, and two pods of 2.75-inch rockets. Its design allowed it to withstand single hits from 12.7 mm armor-piercing rounds and 23 mm high-explosive cannon and continue to fly for 30 minutes. Equipped with a sophisticated target-acquisition andWINTON 413  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 438 --- night-sensor system, the Apache  was, indeed, a formidable weapons system. But its very
