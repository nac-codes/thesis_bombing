dition paid much more explicit attention to the conduct of campaigns and major operations. Of particular note for the conduct of air-ground operations  was the statement that operational level commanders try to set favorable terms for battle by synchronized ground, air, and sea maneuver and by striking the enemy throughout the theater of operations. Large scale ground maneuver will always require protection from enemy air forces andWINTON 417  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 442 --- sometimes from naval forces. Commanders will therefore conduct reconnaissance , interdiction , air defense , and special operations almost continuous ly. Air interdiction , air and ground reconnaissance . . . must all be synchronized to support the overall campaign and its supporting operations on the ground, especially at critical junctures. 67 This was a much different statement than that contained in chapter 8 of the 1976 edition, for it moved the locus of concern from the winning of a single battle to the winning of a campaign . It also reflected a growing maturity on the part of Army  doctrinal writers, for it specifically referred to supporting operations on the ground. Further, it established the ground forces ’ need for air protection and for the synchronization of interdiction  with those forces, especially at critical junctures. However, this doctrinal statement implicitly accepted the proposition that one would make critical decisions on how the synchronization would take place in the context of campaign objectives, not merely the tactical dictates of individual battles . This realization brought it much more in tune with the Air Force  perspective on the employment of airpower. The 1984 edition of AFM 1-1, now titled Basic Aerospace Doctrine of the United States Air Force, formally updated that perspective. Apparently aware of the deficiencies of the previous edition, Air Staff doctrine writers  set out to give the new manual “a new face and thrust.” 68 They fully
