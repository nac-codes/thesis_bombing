The purpose is . . . to generate situations where friendly surface forces  can then take advantage of forecast enemy reactions. 72 Although the manual did not go as far as some critics might have liked in discussing the inherent fog and friction of war, it did at least caution readers to respect the flexibility of enemy forces. 73 Perhaps the most serious charge that one could level against it was its failure to explicitly consider the emergence of the operational level of war as the connecting link between military strategy  and tactics. But the Army , which had first articulated the strategic-operational-tactical paradigm in American doctrine in 1982, was still working its way toward a mature statement of the implications of that model during the drafting of the 1984 edition of AFM 1-1. In sum, this statement of Air Force basic  doctrine represented a more coherent explication of airpower principles than did its predecessor and recognized some of the potential for the cooperation of air and ground forces  at the operational level. However, it stopped short of a fully developed typology of how one could best achieve this synergism. At the tactical level, however, the TAC -TRADOC  partnership was producing great dividends. Gen Wilbur L. Creech — Dixon ’s replacement at TAC —and Starry  continued the well-developed institutional dialogue and met quarterly for face-to-face consultations. 74 The most obvious result of this cooperation was a series of joint manuals dealing with key issues of air-ground operations . These manuals emerged primarily from Army –Air Force  participation in the Blue Flag command-post exercises at Hurlburt Field, Florida , and the Red Flag  force-on-force exercises at Nellis AFB  but also reflected an expansion of the TAC -TRADOC  partnership to involve the Marine Corps  and the Navy .
