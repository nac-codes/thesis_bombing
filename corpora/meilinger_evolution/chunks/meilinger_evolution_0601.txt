And they continued to have difficulty settling the issue of air-ground interface at the operational level of war. The focal point for this obstacle was the divergence of perspectives over battlefield air interdiction (BAI) , addressed as initiative 21. BAI  had a long and checkered past that arose from three issues: (1) the divergence between the Army  and the Air Force  concerning the relative authority of various command echelons in directing aircraft to provide ground support , (2) the elimination of the field army as a ground echelon of command, and (3) the influence of NATO  tactical air doctrine  on US Air Force doctrine . The Air Force  command philosophy, expressed most recently in the 1984 edition of AFM 1-1, was one of “centralize control —decentralize execution .”83 Although the doctrine  did not spell out the  level of centralization, the Air Force  preferred control at the theater of operations. Here, the air component commander  would recommend to the theater commander an apportionment  of assets among the functions of offensive and defensive counterair , AI, and CAS .84 Based on the theater commander’s decision, the air component commander  would allocate specific numbers of sorties by aircraft type to subordinate air formations to perform the various functions. 85 The theater airWINTON 421  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 446 --- commander , however, retained responsibility for control and direction of the AI  effort, and ground commanders  supported by various air formations had a voice only in the suballocation of CAS  sorties to their subordinate units. As we have seen, however, the structure of the air-ground interface process was now in a state of disarray brought about by the disappearance of the field army. The military command structure in Allied Forces Central Europe (AFCENT)  and divergences between British and American philosophies of air-ground operations  further complicated the problem. AFCENT ’s organization included a thea
