re in Allied Forces Central Europe (AFCENT)  and divergences between British and American philosophies of air-ground operations  further complicated the problem. AFCENT ’s organization included a theater headquarters; a supporting air headquarters known as Allied Air Forces Central Europe (AAFCE) , which contained the 2d and 4th Allied Tactical Air Forces   (2ATAF and 4ATAF); and two subordinate land headquarters—Northern Army Group (NORTHAG)  and Central Army Group (CENTAG) . Although 2ATAF  and 4ATAF  remained subordinate to AAFCE , they had responsibility for providing air support to NORTHAG and CENTAG , respectively. Although both ATAFs and both Army  groups were truly allied formations, the British dominated 2ATAF  and NORTHAG , while the Americans dominated 4ATAF  and CENTAG . The British and Americans had distinctly different perspectives on air-ground operations . Based on philosophy, economics, and technology , the Royal Air Force (RAF) preferred to generate a large number of sorties in small, two-plane formations with relatively little centralized control . It also preferred relatively shallow interdiction  to deep interdiction . The USAF , on the other hand, preferred a slightly more “above the fray” approach that emphasized a fewer number of large formations under relatively tight centralized control . In light of its possession of platforms that could conduct deep interdiction  and its concern for the high density of air-defense weapons arrayed at and immediately behind the front lines of Soviet forces, it preferred deep  rather than shallow interdiction .86 In the development of NATO doctrine , however, one could not ignore the British position. Therefore, a compromise in NATO tactical air doctrine  provided for both relatively deep AI and relatively shallow BAI .87 This doctrine  also provided forTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 422  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 447 --- joint BAI  and CAS  in a category known as offensive air support (OAS) .88 Reflec
