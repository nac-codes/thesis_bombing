ould take place at the AFCENT/AAFCE level and that OAS  allocation, including CAS and BAI , would take place at the army group/ATAF level. It also codified the previously agreed arrangement for assigning an air support operations center (ASOC)  to each corps, explicitly recognizing that “generally, only at Corps level will sufficient information be available to determine whether it is possible to engage and counter a threat with conventional organic firepower or whether it is necessary to have this organic firepower supplemented by OAS .”94 In other words, the Army  not only persuaded the Air Force to subscribe to the NATO doctrine  on BAI  but also extracted an admission of the reality that the ATAF commander’s critical decision on the allocation of OAS  sorties between BAI  and CAS would depend upon intelligence  developed at the corps level and passed through the army group to the ATAF. However, two problems arose. First, the position paper was just that—a statement of position, not doctrine . Second, the signature of the Air Force  deputy chief of staff for plans and operations did not remove underlying Air Force  reservations about giving the Army  influence over any form of interdiction .95 In sum, between 1980 and 1986, the Army  and the Air Force  institutionalized the partnership formed from 1973 toTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 424  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 449 --- 1979. This regularization, centered around the Army ’s development and refinement of its AirLand Battle  doctrine, manifested itself in the series of “J” manuals produced by the TAC /TRADOC  relationship and in the 31 initiatives at the departmental level. The Air Force  also developed a more coherent statement of its basic doctrine . Although this doctrine  did not take explicit cognizance of the operational level of war articulated in the 1982 and 1988 editions of FM 100-5, it at least demonstrated a preliminary vision for how air and ground forces might cooperate at this level.
