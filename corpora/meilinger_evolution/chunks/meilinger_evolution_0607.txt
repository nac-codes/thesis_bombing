This effort had begun in 1984 with formation of the Deep Attack Program Office  at Fort Leavenworth , operating under the CAC  aegis. 99 By 1985 CAC  had produced a field circular on corps deep operations. This publication contained an integrating concept for fusing Army intelligence , fire support , air defense , and maneuver assets with tactical air support  to attack a Soviet second-echelon force, as well as the ground and air infrastructure of Soviet CAS  formations. 100 In 1987 the Army  took another step forward in the maturity of its deep battle  concept with the publication of a handbook describing the capabilities of existing and developmental deep battle  systems. The handbook outlined an integrated group of Army  and Air Force  systems to sense enemy targets, process information about these targets, communicate the information to appropriate agencies, and control the Army  and Air Force weapons used to strike them. The Air Force ’s precision location strike system (PLSS)  and JSTARS  and the Army tactical missile system (ATACMS)  were particularly important components of the future architecture for deep battle .101 This pièce de résistance  of deep battle  publications, Corps Deep Operations (ATACMS, Aviation and Intelligence Support): Tactics, Techniques and Procedures Handbook  (1990), outlined the imperative for the corps commander simultaneously to control significant engagements in close operations, deny the enemy the ability to concentrate combat power, attack enemy forces in depth, and retain freedom of action in his own rear area. 102 The key to performing these functions lay in the corps commander’s ability, as part of a theaterwide concept, to influence enemy ground and heliborne operations three to
