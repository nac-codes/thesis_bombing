ion in his own rear area. 102 The key to performing these functions lay in the corps commander’s ability, as part of a theaterwide concept, to influence enemy ground and heliborne operations three to four days in the future. 103 This called for very close integration of the corps maneuver and fire support  assets with Air Force  BAI  and electronic countermeasures .104 In sum, the work was exactly what its title implied—a handy how-to book for use by corps commanders and their principal planners in sorting out the difficult coordination issues involved in attacking second-echelon divisions of a Soviet-style combined-arms army. It reflected sixTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 426  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 451 --- years of hard thinking that conceptually represented the practical link between technology  developed to  fight the deep battle  and the overarching doctrine of AirLand Battle . One had to examine the other side of the coin, however. By developing extended-range systems that allowed the corps commander to fight the deep battle , the Army  raised the question of coordinating the effects of these systems with air operations . The immediate focus of this issue became the placement of and procedures surrounding the fire support coordination line (FSCL) —originally known as the “no-bomb line” and developed in World War II  as a coordination measure to mitigate against the chances of aircraft dropping ordnance on friendly troops. It was defined as a line short of which  the release of air weapons required the prior clearance of a ground commander , and it applied primarily to aircrews returning from interdiction  and armed reconnaissance  missions with unexpended ordnance, who wanted to be able to take advantage of targets of opportunity without endangering friendly ground forces . The rule of thumb for the FSCL  was to place it at the limit of the range of friendly artillery. As long as this range remained in the neighborhood of 10–15 kilometers beyond the f
