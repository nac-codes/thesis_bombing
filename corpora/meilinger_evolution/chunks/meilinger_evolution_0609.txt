dly ground forces . The rule of thumb for the FSCL  was to place it at the limit of the range of friendly artillery. As long as this range remained in the neighborhood of 10–15 kilometers beyond the friendly front lines, this placement did not present much of a problem because one would coordinate air strikes  within that range with ground forces . However, with the advent of the multiple launch rocket system (MLRS)  and, later, ATACMS , the Army  had systems that could range out to roughly 30 and one hundred kilometers, respectively. Additionally, the corps deep- attack manual envisioned Apache  helicopter attacks to a depth of 70 to one hundred kilometers beyond the front lines. These newly developed capabilities placed the Army  and the Air Force  at loggerheads. If, on the one hand, the FSCL  were pushed out to the depths of new Army  weapons, it would significantly interfere with Air Force  interdiction  efforts and could allow enemy forces to escape attack by friendly air formations. If, on the other hand, the FSCL  were kept relatively close to friendly front lines, the corps commander would lose freedom of action in the employment of fire support assets if he had to coordinate these fires with the Air Force prior to execution. This conundrum defied mutually satisfactory resolution. 105WINTON 427  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 452 --- Another indicator of the potential fraying of the Army –Air Force  partnership was the publication in 1988 of Warden ’s The Air Campaign: Planning for Combat .106 One could interpret this book on two levels. At the most obvious level, it was an intelligent and imaginative tract that took the basic logic of operational art —the linkage of strategic objectives and tactical goals—and applied it to air warfare . As such, it addressed classic military questions such as the relationship between offense and defense, the trade-offs between concentration and economy of force , the employment of operational reserves, and the
