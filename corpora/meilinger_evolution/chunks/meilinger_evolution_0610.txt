addressed classic military questions such as the relationship between offense and defense, the trade-offs between concentration and economy of force , the employment of operational reserves, and the use of deception in war—all from an air perspective. In this sense, it was hardly revolutionary. Many people interpreted the book as simply the work of a thoughtful airman who wished to encourage his colleagues in the Air Force  to consider the implications of operational art  for the practice of their profession. In another sense, however, it constituted an airpower manifesto in the tradition of the works of Giulio Douhet , Billy Mitchell , and Alexander de Seversky . Although carefully qualified, a theme of airpower dominance ran through the book like a brightly colored thread. Chapter subheads such as “Single Arms Can Prevail,” “War Can Be Won from the Air,” and “Command Is True Center of Gravity” suggested an airpower-centered approach to warfare that had perhaps not fully matured at the time of publication. That soon changed. The pivotal question that The Air Campaign  had not addressed was, If airpower can be a war-winning instrument, how  does it become one? In the summer of 1988, Warden  conceived of an answer to that question. 107 Picturing an enemy society as a system, he reasoned that its ability to generate power depended on five subsystems: leadership, organic essentials, infrastructure, population, and fielded forces (in decreasing order of significance). 108 Warden  represented these subsystems as five concentric rings , with leadership in the center and fielded forces on the circumference. This formulation directly confronted a central concern of almost all airpower thinkers—what to target. To Warden  the answer was clear: one should start at the inside and work out.THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 428  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 453 --- In ordinary times, Warden ’s book and his subsequent musings on targeting philosophies would have held not much mor
