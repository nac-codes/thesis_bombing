It did, however, represent a view in the Air Force  that one could—perhaps even should—think of the application of airpower as independent of ground operations . To this extent, it constituted another crosscurrent in the story of Army –Air Force  partnership Conclusions This study has endeavored to answer questions about the areas of convergence and divergence between Army  and Air Force  perspectives on air-ground operations  between the end of the Vietnam War  and the eve of Operation Desert Shield , and the underlying causes for them. Clearly, the services agreed about a great deal—that CAS  was important, that it was an Air Force  mission, and that they needed a dedicated CAS  platform (and, therewith, a dedicated group of pilots whose sole training focus would address execution of the CAS  mission). They agreed on the importance of SEAD , the fact that it was a shared responsibility, and the detailed procedures required to effect it. They agreed on the importance of attacking enemy second-echelon forces, the use of Army helicopters  and Air Force platforms working in close cooperation to accomplish this mission, and the detailed tactical procedures required to do it. They disagreed over two issues: (1) the amount of influence that senior ground commanders  should have over Air Force interdiction  operations and (2) the mechanisms for coordinating the effects of fixed-wing air and extended-range Army  systems. At the risk of being somewhat simplistic, one can conclude that although very significant agreement existed at the tactical level, noticeable divergence characterized the operational level. One can gain
