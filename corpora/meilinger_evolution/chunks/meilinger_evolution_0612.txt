the risk of being somewhat simplistic, one can conclude that although very significant agreement existed at the tactical level, noticeable divergence characterized the operational level. One can gain insight into the dynamics behind these similarities and differences of perspective by surveying the centripetal forces that tended to pull the Army  and the Air Force  together and the centrifugal forces that tended to pull them apart.WINTON 429  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 454 --- One can attribute the relative cohesion and strength of the Army –Air Force  partnership from 1973 to 1990 in rough priority to (1) the unifying effect of the NATO  defense mission, (2) the close cooperation of personalities at or near the top of each service, (3) a leadership shift in the Air Force  that put fighter rather than bomber  pilots in the majority of influential positions, and (4) the clarity of the Army ’s vision of how it intended to fight a future war  that tended to pull the Air Force in its wake. The NATO  defense mission gave each service a clear and unifying  mission. The ability to defeat a Warsaw Pact  invasion of western Europe  below the nuclear threshold remained, for the period under analysis, the single most significant criterion of operational effectiveness for both services. When the Army  and the Air Force  looked at this challenge, each realized it needed the other. Despite the fact that the Army  had greater dependence on the Air Force  than vice versa, one could not deny that in the SEAD  mission, the Air Force  distinctly needed Army  help. Furthermore, in order to make manifest its contribution to the national defense , the Air Force  had to demonstrate its ability to destroy Soviet tanks as well as Soviet MiGs . The close personal relations established between senior Army and Air Force  leaders proved vital to the strength of the partnership. The positive personal chemistry apparent in, among others, the Abrams /Brown , DePuy /Dixon , Wickham
