ng new doctrinal challenges that defied easy solution. Interestingly, the partnership between the two services appeared to be independent of two factors that frequently play a role in interservice relationships: the size of the defense budget  and external pressure for cooperation. The partnership began in the mid-1970s, when the defense budget  fell steadily in the aftermath of Vietnam , and it continued to prosper throughout the 1980s, when the defense budget  proved relatively robust. Further, outside pressure for greater joint cooperation evidently did not foist the partnership on the services. Congress  passed the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act  of 1986 well after the TAC -TRADOC  dialogue had matured into a partnership and after the Wickham/Gabriel regime had officially formulated its 31 initiatives. Also, Doctrine for Joint Operations,  the key joint publication resulting from the Goldwater-Nichols Act ’s specific recognition of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  as the promulgator of joint doctrine , was still in draft form in 1990. 112 The drive for jointness , therefore, had virtually no effect on the cooperation established between the two services during the period addressed in this essay. Although one could argue that an earlier start on joint doctrine  might have settled unresolved issues between the Army  and the Air Force  prior to 1990, the extent to which joint doctrine  can compensate for a lack of internally generated interservice cooperation remains to be demonstrated. If one takes George Szell’s criteria for the production of high-quality symphonic music as the basis for judging the Army  and the Air Force  from 1973 to 1990, one finds that they fall just short of the maestro’s high standards. 113 They were magnificent individual performers. Each had equipped and trained itself to play its part as a virtuoso. Each had also listened to the other enough to recognize how they could most harmoniously blend their
