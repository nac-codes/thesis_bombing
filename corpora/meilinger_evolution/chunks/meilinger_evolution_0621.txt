Rogers, supreme allied commander, Europe, to various US senators and representatives, letter, subject: Fielding of the Apache, 22 July 1982. This letter stated in part, “Since the early 1970s I have been involved personally in the Army effort to field an AAH [advanced attack helicopter], and have seen previous attempts fail.
