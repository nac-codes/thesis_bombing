For most of its history, the alliance confronted a numerically superior foe and geopolitical realities that prevented a military strategy  which traded space for time; the alliance also relied on both the US strategic nuclear umbrella and conventional reinforcements from North America. Further, NATO air doctrine  is very much negotiated doctrine , especially cross-nationally—mainly between the United States and the United Kingdom —and intranationally, among the US services. The efforts of NATO ’s Tactical Air Working Party (TAWP)  to write NATO’s air doctrines  best exemplify this situation. 7 Negotiated doctrine  is neither necessarily bad nor bland; however, it is time-consuming because one must obtain consensus from a group of sovereign countries that belong to a voluntary association. NATO ’s influence on US Air Force doctrine  has been cyclical: closely associated in the 1950s and largely built around massive retaliation , the two doctrines began diverging in the 1980s, as USAF doctrine  began emphasizing offensive operations. They may, however, be reconverging in the 1990s, due to the influence of the Persian Gulf War . Further, the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 mandated the development of joint US military doctrine , thereby enhancing and constraining the US negotiation position. That is, the US position is now consolidated, but USAF doctrine  must more closely conform to the larger set of US doctrine. Moreover, the US positions at TAWP , for example, reflect the consensus views of all the US services—not just the USAF . This chapter outlines and explains the political and military context of NATO’s air doctrine  because, as mentioned above, one cannot explain air strategy  without understanding the military strategy  it supports, and one cannot understand the military strategy  without understanding its political context.THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 444  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 468 --- The essay’s major divisio
