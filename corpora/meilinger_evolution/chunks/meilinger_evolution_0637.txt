se beginning immediately behind the border, and that its forces should not surrender territory without a fight. Again, planners always kept nuclear weapons  in mind because political realities dictated that NATO  could give little ground before having to employ these weapons against invaders. In this early period, USAF  and NATO doctrine  starts to diverge over the use of air forces to secure command of the air. Although USAF doctrine  emphasized air superiority  as aTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 448  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 472 --- prerequisite for further air operations , NATO  softened this to emphasize air defense  that provided only a favorable air situation, because NATO  believed it had insufficient aircraft to dedicate to the air superiority  role. Further, NATO  emphasized the “defense” aspect of air defense  and did not foresee a large, offensive counterair (OCA)  mission for fighter  sweeps, escort, or a major commitment to attacking Warsaw Pact  airfields. This thinking was in line with NATO ’s strategy of integrated air defenses , whereby ground-based air defense  systems enhanced fighter  aircraft. Another area of apparent divergence involved the efficacy of aerial attack against vital targets—economic as well as military—deep within enemy territory. Within a decade after the close of World War II , whose lessons taught many airmen that the strategic bombing  of Germany  was at least a—if not the—decisive element in Germany ’s defeat, NATO  abandoned plans to attack the sorts of targets hit by British and US bomber  fleets during the war. NATO ’s reasoning was that it did not wish to present even the appearance  of being a threat to the USSR , fearing that long-range conventional bombers would suggest as much. Further, the advent of nuclear weapons  had changed air doctrines since World War II , altering the air bombardment equation in two ways: (1) the immense destructive power of atomic weapons  rendered them ill suited for a precision bombi
