s  had changed air doctrines since World War II , altering the air bombardment equation in two ways: (1) the immense destructive power of atomic weapons  rendered them ill suited for a precision bombing  role and (2) most people thought that a nuclear war would be over quickly. In such a scenario, attacks against economic  or industrial targets , because they seemed to offer mostly long-term benefits, became militarily insignificant. In reality, however, NATO never really abandoned strategic bombardment  but deferred to the largely US-based bomber  force to accomplish this mission. 26 Thus, the one area of convergence between US and NATO air doctrine —the one deemed most critical by both—remained nuclear doctrine . Although NATO  political and military strategies served well during an era of unmatched US political and military dominance, external and internal changes to the alliance in the mid-1960s caused the questioning and revising of both strategies. This stimulated a quest for modernization ofMCCRABB 449  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 473 --- conventional forces and a determination to confine any war to the nonnuclear level. Modernization, 1967–89 Starting in the late 1970s and continuing into the mid-1980s, NATO  substantially upgraded its conventional and nuclear forces. 27 The USAF  removed most of its older weapon systems and introduced newer aircraft such as the A-10 , F-111F , F-15 , and F-16 . European countries introduced new platforms such as the Tornado  and F-16  into their inventories, although at a slower pace than did the United States . NATO also acquired precision-guided munitions  such as laser-guided bombs , electro-optical guided  bombs, precision television-guided  and infrared-guided antitank  missiles, and runway attack munitions. NATO ’s decision in 1979 to deploy nuclear-armed ground launched cruise missiles (GLCM)  and Pershing II  missiles—to enhance deterrence by countering Soviet SS-20s —proved both a major milestone in
