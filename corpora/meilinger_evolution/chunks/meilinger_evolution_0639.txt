NATO ’s decision in 1979 to deploy nuclear-armed ground launched cruise missiles (GLCM)  and Pershing II  missiles—to enhance deterrence by countering Soviet SS-20s —proved both a major milestone in alliance military history and a highly political act. Upgrades to the command and control (C2) arena included a NATO airborne early warning (NAEW)  aircraft, based upon the US E-3 airborne warning and control system (AWACS)  aircraft, and the allied C 2 system. The late 1960s witnessed numerous changes that would ultimately lead to a major reexamination of NATO’s military strategy .
