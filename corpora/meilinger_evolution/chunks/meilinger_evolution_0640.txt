the Warsaw Pact  was organized, trained, and equipped to conduct a short-notice attack against Allied Forces Central Europe (AFCENT)  in order to achieve the Rhine crossings and capture ports on the North Sea within a few days.34 Perhaps the most significant change in MC 14/3 was that nuclear employment became part of a “deliberate escalation” rather than an inevitable response to an invasion. 35 USAF  and NATO air defense doctrine  continued to diverge during this time period, as NATO  continued to emphasize defensive counterair (DCA) . For example, it increased its use of hardened aircraft shelters and modernized ground-based air defenses  (such as Patriot  missiles) as a counter to the newer Warsaw Pact  air forces. Notably, no other NATO  air force sought the longer-range, more capable air-to-air fighters such as the F-15  or F-14 , which the United States  brought on-line in the 1970s. Furthermore, no countries other than Great Britain  planned to use the multinational Tornado , developed in an air defense  variant, primarily for interdiction . Nevertheless, this period remains the high point of convergence between USAF and NATO air strategy , for planners  framed USAF doctrine  and force structure in almost an exclusively European context. Furthermore, this period saw the convergence of opinion between the US Army  and the USAF  over the role of airpower on the NATO  battlefield. 36 In July 1970 Gen Andrew Goodpaster , SACEUR , requested that the Military Agency for Standardization (MAS) 37 form a working party “to develop a tactical air doctrine  that would provide a common understanding of the role of air power in allied operations, and a set of common procedures for successfully implementing air operations .”38 The primary driving force at work here was the strategy of flexible response . As NATO began exploring a more robust conventional deterrent and war-fighting strategy, the requirement for NATO ’s ground, air, and naval forces to work together effectiv
