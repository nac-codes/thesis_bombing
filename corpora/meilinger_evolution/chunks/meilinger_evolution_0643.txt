’s recognition that air superiority provides freedom of movement to friendly forces and, by denying it to enemy forces, facilitates other NATO  air missions. Furthermore, contrary to the beliefs of most airpower advocates, it foresees airpower as essentially playing a supporting role to naval and ground forces. As shown later, efforts that allow a more independent role for airpower constitute one of the great doctrinal changes that NATO  is contemplating in the 1990s. Basic NATO air operations  include counterair , interdiction , reconnaissance  and surveillance , offensive air support (OAS) , tactical transport, support of maritime operations, and other supporting operations such as electronic warfare , suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) , air-to-air refueling , search and rescue , and special operations . Each of these operations warrants a specific chapter in ATP-33, and most have a more detailed ATP of their own. (The doctrinal pamphlets on air superiority  [ATP-42] and OAS  [ATP-27] receive more detailed treatment below.) First, however, one should examine the doctrinal guidance on C 2 of overall air operations  provided in ATP-33. NATO  defines command  as the authority to direct, coordinate, or control one’s own forces; control  is the authorityMCCRABB 453  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 477 --- to do those same tasks over forces not under the individual’s command. Furthermore, C 2 is divided between operational and tactical, the latter applying only to the accomplishment of specific and generally local  missions or tasks. 45 The pamphlet calls for the planning and direction of tactical air operations  at an air command operations center (ACOC) , with control delegated to subordinate allied tactical operations centers (ATOC) . The pamphlet stresses the principles of centralized control  (to promote an integrated effort in execution of plans) and decentralized execution  (to provide flexibility in the detailed planning and execution of those
