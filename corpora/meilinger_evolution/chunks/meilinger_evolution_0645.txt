Page 478 --- they often use the same resources, one cannot view them in isolation from each other. ATP-42 considers SEAD  part of the offensive operations and defines it as activity which “neutralizes, destroys or temporarily degrades enemy air defense  systems in a specific area by physical attack and/or electronic warfare .”51 SEAD  became an important area of dispute between the USAF  and NATO . USAF doctrine  considers SEAD  coequal with OCA  and DCA , while NATO , as shown above, views SEAD  only as part of OCA . Specifically, at the most basic level, USAF doctrine  assumes a global perspective whereas, obviously, NATO doctrine  covers a more narrowly focused region. In the 1970s, the USAF  had an opportunity to test its doctrines  in the skies over Vietnam . One important lesson it learned there was that SEAD  deserved to be elevated to a position coequal with OCA  and DCA . Further, few NATO  air forces other than US forces have resources (such as the US F-4G Wild Weasel aircraft) for the SEAD  mission. 52 These countries feared that a separate SEAD  mission would require them to buy SEAD -dedicated aircraft. Also, within NATO  itself, a difference exists between separate allied tactical air forces (ATAF) . As Stein , Kimberly Nolan , and Robert Perry  write, 2ATAF (dominated by the RAF ) and 4ATAF  (largely a USAF  operation) “tend to operate as ‘national’ tactical air forces rather than as a ‘combined’ force.” 53 For example, although 2ATAF  does not have specific doctrine for SEAD , 4ATAF  does. The C 2 of counterair operations  flows from the major NATO commanders (e.g., SHAPE ) through major subordinate commanders (MSC —e.g., AFCENT ) to principal subordinate commanders (PSC —e.g., of Air Forces Central Europe [COMAIRCENT]), who generally exercise operational  control 54 for counterair operations  (and other air missions) though, in practice, tactical control  is further delegated to ATOCs  and their subordinate sector operations centers (SOC) .
