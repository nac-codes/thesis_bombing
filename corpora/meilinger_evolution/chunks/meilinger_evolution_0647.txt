nd forces . The first rendition of this doctrine, ATP-27(A), included three functions under the OAS  umbrella: CAS , AI, and tactical air reconnaissance (TAR) .60 During discussions about revisions to ATP-27(A) at the 1977 TAWP ,61 the USAF  objected to the inclusion of AI  as an OAS  mission because it is not a support mission; its objectives derive from the overall goals of the combined  force—not those specifically derived from the land force commander . Furthermore, since these missions occur outside the direct scope of land operations, they do not require the detailed integration with the fire-and-maneuver scheme of ground forces —a requirement inherent in CAS .62 TAWP  accepted this, and ATP-27(B) removed AI  from OAS  but replaced it with BAI : “air action against hostile surface targets which are in a position to directly  affect friendly forces and which requires joint planning and coordination” (emphasis added). 63THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 456  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 480 --- Some understanding of the evolution from AI  to BAI  rests on the different approaches the RAF  and the USAF  took to the management of airpower and air-to-ground coordination. 64 The Americans viewed airpower as a theaterwide asset with inherent flexibility. As such, this required a C 2 structure over the entire Central Region —the role of Allied Air Forces Central Europe (AAFCE) . Although the British recognized the flexibility of airpower, they preferred a national chain of command (such as existed between the British-dominated 2ATAF  and Northern Army Group [NORTHAG] ) that would provide a more direct and immediate means of coordination. The RAF  feared that losing “control” over AI  would limit the ability of its airpower to relieve pressure on NORTHAG forces. 65 Therefore, it proposed BAI  as a way to provide additional air support (beyond CAS ) to NORTHAG . (BAI  is essentially a mission between the closely coordinated and integrated CAS  and AI , which, under ATP-
