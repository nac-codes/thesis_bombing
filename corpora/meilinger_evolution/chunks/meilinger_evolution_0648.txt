re, it proposed BAI  as a way to provide additional air support (beyond CAS ) to NORTHAG . (BAI  is essentially a mission between the closely coordinated and integrated CAS  and AI , which, under ATP-27[B], required no coordination of integration between ground and air forces.) In order to solve the disagreement between the RAF  and USAF , the TAWP  set up a “drafting committee” to iron out a compromise. Notably, the committee included representatives of both the air and ground services of only three countries: the United States , the United Kingdom , and West Germany . The USAF  voiced three objections to BAI . First, it imposed air-ground coordination where none had previously existed under the prevailing AI  concept. Second, it required coordination at a level—proposed to be the army corps—that seemed inconsistent with a theaterwide view of airpower management. Third, the USAF  viewed BAI  as an intrusion on airpower prerogatives in determining the best employment of scarce airpower resources. The final document, ATP-27(B), reflected a compromise between the USAF  and RAF  positions. BAI, unlike CAS , would not be conducted under ground-force direction, thus maintaining the principle of centralized control . Furthermore, one could execute BAI  to fulfill ground  or air commanders ’ requests and thus could fly BAI  on either  side of the fire support coordination line (FSCL) —the traditional dividing line between CAS  and AI . Finally, BAI  was maintained at the ATAF /army group level and not allocated  down to corps/air support operations centers (ASOC) , as with CAS .MCCRABB 457  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 481 --- AirLand Battle and Follow-on Forces Attack Several key initiatives converged in the late 1970s that would result in a strategic and operational split within NATO .
