k the first steps towards rationalizing its air structure, primarily through the creation in 1974 of AAFCE , located at Ramstein Air Base, West Germany , to command 2ATAF  and 4ATAF . Although this did not provide a true centralized control apparatus (for example, BAI was still allocated, tasked, and executed at the ATAF level), it began the process of integrating air assets into a theaterwide view versus a more narrowly defined (by land-force boundaries) view of airpower. This move was essential if airpower intended to play a more decisive role in blunting massive Warsaw Pact  attacks through interdiction against second-echelon (and deeper) forces. Furthermore, planning of air defense  and offensive air operations became combined in the ATOC , which eliminated the false distinction between these air operations . It also recognized the importance of both missions to the counterair  struggle and acknowledged that one would likely use the same assets in both roles. Again, this action highlighted a theaterwide view of airpower employment . NATO in the Post-Cold-War Era Undoubtedly, the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact  and the Soviet Union  represented the most monumental change that took place in NATO ’s history. Although the collapse ofTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 460  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 484 --- Communism  in Europe  was significant, to say the least, other events rank high in NATO ’s recent past. For example, despite NATO ’s peripheral involvement in the Persian Gulf War  of 1991, many European NATO  countries (and air forces) played a significant role in that conflict. Further, throughout its history, NATO  avoided out-of-area operations; however, by the mid-1990s, it found itself actively involved in combat operations in the former Yugoslavia .74 Lessons learned from the Gulf War  and the Balkans  affected the development of NATO air doctrine  in fundamental ways; further, NATO  and US air doctrines are once again merging in significant ways, mirrorin
