learned from the Gulf War  and the Balkans  affected the development of NATO air doctrine  in fundamental ways; further, NATO  and US air doctrines are once again merging in significant ways, mirroring the earliest days of the alliance. Four major geopolitical changes occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s: the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact  and the breakup of the Soviet Union ; the breakup of Yugoslavia  and the subsequent civil war; the Persian Gulf War ; and the denuclearization of NATO . The first event seemingly eliminated NATO ’s raison d’être, while the second and third reinforced the fact that Europe —as well as areas critical to Europe —remains less than peaceful; further, turmoil in these areas, even if it does not directly (or immediately) appear to threaten NATO , still poses problems for the alliance. The final event eliminated a core part of NATO ’s long-standing military strategy . Even during the heyday of conventional war fighting, nuclear weapons  provided a reassuring backstop to NATO  war plans. The demise of the Warsaw Pact  generated both external and internal military changes in Europe . Most importantly, Soviet forces, which constituted the backbone of Warsaw Pact capability, withdrew from eastern and central Europe , thus no longer occupying territory adjacent to NATO . To military planners , this move seemed to offer substantially increased warning time, even if Russian forces attempted to invade western Europe . Likewise, the fact that former Warsaw Pact members were politically distancing themselves from Moscow offered the potential scenario that a resurgent Russia  might have to fight its way west, even to reach NATO  lands. Further, political instability in Russia  and the rapid downsizing of the military forces of former Warsaw Pact  countries led the latter to seek closer ties to NATO  for purposes of security.MCCRABB 461  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 485 --- Internal changes in NATO  often mirrored those in the now
