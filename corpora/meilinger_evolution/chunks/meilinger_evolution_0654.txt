countries led the latter to seek closer ties to NATO  for purposes of security.MCCRABB 461  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 485 --- Internal changes in NATO  often mirrored those in the now-defunct Warsaw Pact . Foremost was the withdrawal of substantial US forces from Europe . By the mid-1990s, the United States  maintained one army corps and fewer than 10 fighter  squadrons in Europe —down from two corps and almost 25 fighter squadrons. Furthermore, most of these combat units disbanded, thus reducing the number of available units in the event of increased tensions in Europe .

In this cauldron in 1994, NATO  found itself conducting its first combat operations. The ironies are rampant. For 40 years, NATO  girded for an onslaught of conventional forces from the east; what it got was insurgency  and terrorism  in a civil war fueled by ethnic and religious
