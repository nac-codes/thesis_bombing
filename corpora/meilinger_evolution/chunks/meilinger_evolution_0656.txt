Most notably, these actions demonstrated the alliance’s political will (something many commentators had questioned) and its basic defensive posture. The third key aspect of the Gulf crisis is that 14 of the 16 NATO  members sent forces to support the anti-Iraq coalition .81 (Iceland  has no military forces but did contribute funds; Luxembourg  has only minimal forces.) In late 1991, NATO  substantially changed the role of nuclear weapons  in its military strategy , reducing by 80 percent the substrategic stockpile—everything from GLCMs and surface-to-surface  missiles to atomic artillery shells and free-fall nuclear weapons  carried by tactical fighter aircraft .
