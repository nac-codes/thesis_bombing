working party in a somewhat uncomfortable position of determiningTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 464  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 488 --- whether a previously unclassified document should now be classified or whether parts of the document (such as the detailed tactics, techniques, and procedures) should be stripped out of the parent document and be made separate documents. Some members expressed concern that certain information, such as procedures for aborting a CAS  attack, is somewhat sensitive and that releasing that information could come back to haunt NATO  sometime in the future. In the end, however, the TAWP  decided to release all of these publications, at least partly because ongoing and future joint exercises between NATO  countries and PFP  countries required the sharing of these procedures to accomplish the exercises successfully. 91 Despite ongoing changes, some key trends are emerging within NATO’s air doctrine . The most fundamental changes sprang from a seminal paper on joint air operations  written by Maj Luigi Meyer  of the USAF ’s Doctrine Center , located at Langley AFB, Virginia . This paper outlined US views (not just those of the USAF ) on such issues as strategic attack , command relationships, and battlefield control measures. Many of these concepts are making their way into NATO doctrine . For example, Allied Joint Pub (AJP)-1(A), Allied Joint Operations  Doctrine, 92 states that its primary objective is “to provide a ‘keystone’ doctrine for the planning, executio n, and support of allied joint operations .”93 The publication includes strategic attack  as an air operation , recommends the designation of a joint force air component commander (JFACC)  to ensure unity of the air effort, and further  recom- mends that the JFACC  assume additional responsibilities as air defense commander (ADC)  and airspace control authority (ACA) .94 This “trihatted” approach precisely mirrors US joint doctrine  and USAF doctrine . AJP-1(A) also includes a
