commander —specifically (in the Central Region ), COMAIRCENT, a PSC  under commander in chief Central Europe (CINCENT). 101 Notably, COMAIRCENT would have operational control of the forces assigned to that region. In this case, the pamphlet specifies that CINCENT makes the apportionment  decision (again, the determination, by percentage or priority, of how much of the total air effort goes to a specific air operation ), based upon COMAIRCENT’s recommendation and after consultation with the other component commanders (e.g., the land and/or naval commander ). NATO  organizational charts anticipate these decisions, and the consequent planning functions will be colocated at the joint command operations center while the tasking of OAS  (and all other air missions) will originate with the combined air operations center . In summary, NATO  has undergone substantial political, military, and doctrinal changes in a relatively short period of time. Certainly, NATO  air forces have learned substantial lessons from the experience of both the United States  and other countries in the Gulf War . Despite significant merging between US and NATO doctrine , vestiges of older doctrines remain entrenched, the most notable example of which is BAI . In assessing the future direction of NATO air doctrine , Col Robert D. Coffman , commander of the USAF’s Doctrine Center , believes that NATO  will ultimately accept the JFACC and strategic attack , and that BAI  will probably remain. He also believes that, despite the drawdown of US forces in Europe , the United States  retains significant influence in NATO ’s doctrinal discussions. Finally, in assessing the impact of the Goldwater-Nichols Act , which reinvigorated US joint doctrine , he maintains that the act served as a strengthening step for the United States  because it forced other NATO countries to face a unified doctrinal front from America .102MCCRABB 467  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 491 --- Conclusions NATO ’s first p
