orces accomplished a breakthrough, forcing NATO  to employ nuclear weapons , presumably the Warsaw Pact  would retaliate in kind. The result perhaps would have been an even quicker Warsaw Pact  victory but at a considerably higher cost to both sides—especially in civilian casualties . Over the three periods examined here, a few themes emerge regarding the influences of NATO air doctrine  on USAF doctrine  and vice versa. Specifically, during the early years of the alliance, NATO ’s strategy for the use of nuclear weapons —the doctrine of massive retaliation —fitted well with USAF doctrine  and force structure.103 However, by the time NATO  shifted focus in the late 1950s, the two doctrines started to diverge. Whereas NATO  contemplated a DCA  battle, a reflection of its political imperatives, the USAF  stressed the need for an OCA  campaign in order to destroy Soviet and Warsaw Pact  air forces that might deliver nuclear weapons against the allies. In large part, this divergence reflected the overwhelmingly strategic orientation of the USAF  as opposed to the more tactical focus of NATO . Another theme was thatMCCRABB 469  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 493 --- NATO planners  did not envision total air superiority  over all of western Europe , seeking instead only local or battlefield air superiority , while USAF doctrine  emphasized the critical requirement for theaterwide air superiority  as the first priority of an air force. By the 1970s and 1980s, NATO  and USAF doctrines  were back in sync, not because NATO  changed but because USAF doctrine  dramatically shifted from an offensive, global, nuclear orientation to a conventional, European one. Perhaps the most dramatic example of this shift lay in the changing perception of the role of airpower in the opening days of a conflict. Under the NATO  scenario—assuming the numerical superiority of Warsaw Pact  forces, a Warsaw Pact  initiative, and a requirement for US air and ground support—USAF  and NATO
