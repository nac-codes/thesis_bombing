ening days of a conflict. Under the NATO  scenario—assuming the numerical superiority of Warsaw Pact  forces, a Warsaw Pact  initiative, and a requirement for US air and ground support—USAF  and NATO  commanders recognized that a specific battle for air superiority , especially through offensive airfield attacks, would have to wait. The immediate priority would be air defense  of ports, nuclear facilities, command centers, and movements of NATO  ground forces , along with battlefield support to prevent a Warsaw Pact  breakthrough. 104 The latest version of USAF basic doctrine , published in 1992, had no link to NATO air  doctrine105 and came at a time when NATO  underwent massive changes. Unsurprisingly, the two doctrines diverged somewhat. However, in the mid-1990s, both USAF/US joint doctrine  and NATO doctrine  are undergoing substantial changes that promise a new era of convergence. One should note that the USAF doctrine preceded both the joint and NATO  doctrinal development. Of course, one should expect this, insofar as doctrinal innovations should come from the air service first, because of its expertise and familiarity. It then diffuses through the other doctrinal outlets, such as joint doctrine  or NATO  pamphlets. The role played by operating commands in doctrinal development reveals another important aspect of the differences between the US and NATO  experiences. The Goldwater-Nichols Act  specifically defined a role for US war-fighting commands (e.g., US European Command , Pacific Command , Atlantic Command , and others), whereas in NATO , the war-fighting commands (e.g., Allied Forces Central, Allied Forces South, and their subordinate allied air commands) playTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 470  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 494 --- a more limited role. For example, although the MSC /PSCs  can propose doctrinal changes, they have no vote in the ratification process. Furthermore, although US joint doctrine is authoritative and directive, US commanders
