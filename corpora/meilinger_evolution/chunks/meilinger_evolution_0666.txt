or example, although the MSC /PSCs  can propose doctrinal changes, they have no vote in the ratification process. Furthermore, although US joint doctrine is authoritative and directive, US commanders can deviate for cause. NATO ’s military commanders, however, are much more closely tied to the doctrinal prescriptions found in NATO publications. Finally, for most NATO  countries, NATO doctrine is “national” doctrine , in that no other doctrine  exists—as it does in the United States . Thus, these NATO  countries might take a much more interested posture in NATO  doctrinal development. This is particularly true for countries such as the United States , United Kingdom , and France , that have more global interests and thus tend to write doctrine  from that perspective, unlike other NATO  countries with a more “European” view. Three examples of convergence between US doctrine  (both USAF and joint )106 and emerging NATO  doctrine 107 lie in C 2 arrangements, synergy from an integrated AI  and ground maneuver scheme, and the role of strategic attack  against enemy centers of gravity . All three doctrinal manuals recognize unity of effort as a key requirement for successful integration of air resources, and all recognize the JFACC  as the proper mechanism for achieving this integration. 108 Each relates how meshing AI  with ground maneuver presents the enemy with an “agonizing dilemma”: if the enemy disperses to avoid air attack , he becomes more susceptible to piecemeal destruction by friendly maneuver forces ; but if the enemy force concentrates, it leaves itself open for devastating air attack .109 Finally, all three documents recognize that direct attack against key enemy centers of gravity —most effectively accomplished by airpower—offers potential payoffs much greater than those produced by air resources used in more traditional OAS  roles. 110 Undoubtedly, NATO air doctrine  has undergone tremendous changes over the past several years, matching the rapidly changing
