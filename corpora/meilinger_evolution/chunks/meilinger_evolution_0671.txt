Countries assume responsibility for certain documents. For example, Great Britain is the custodian of Allied Tactical Pamphlet 33 (ATP-33); Germany maintains ATP-27; and the United States is the custodian of ATPs 40 and 42. These publications are reviewed on a periodic basis, and proposals for change are submitted from the countries or the affected NATO commands, collated by the custodian, and then reviewed at the working parties (e.g., the TAWP). The recommended changes are then proposed to the working parties’ sponsoring board, which acts as the coordinating agent to gain ratification from the individual countries (the NATO commands do not have a vote). Once a sufficient number of countries ratifies the changes (each board decides the appropriate number), the board promulgates them. Group Capt Alan E.
