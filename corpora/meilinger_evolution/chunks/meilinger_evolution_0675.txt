The latter evolved into the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and, as such, formally declared the end of the cold war with the signing of the Charter of Paris on 20 November 1990. 31. One can trace the origins of this strategy to speeches made by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in Athens at the NATO ministerial meeting in the spring of 1962 and a commencement address he gave at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor a few weeks later. See Kugler, 140–42. He formalized the strategy in a draft presidential memorandum in 1965. In that document, McNamara challenged the underlying assumptions of NATO’s nuclear policy—specifically the notions that these weapons could somehow compensate for NATO’s inferiority in conventional forces and that the Europeans would really permit nuclear war on their territory. See Park in Kaplan et al., 225. 32. By the mid-1960s, the United States had removed B-47 strategic bombers and shorter-ranged ballistic missiles such as Jupiter and Thor from Europe, largely due to its fielding of the longer-ranged B-52s, Minutemen ICBMs, and the advent of sea-launched ballistic missiles.
