B, Va., 17 March 1995. 40. With the establishment of the USAF’s Doctrine Center in 1994, that responsibility now lies with that organization. 41. Stein, 17. 42. NATO ATPs have never been hierarchical, unlike US doctrinal publications; nor is there any logic behind their numbering. For example, although ATP-33 is the keystone document on tactical airpower doctrine, laying out the larger picture of air missions, ATP-27 elaborates on one set of those missions—OAS—while ATP-42 limits itself to another set—counterair. At the 18th TAWP, the United Kingdom proposed a more rational structure, whereby ATP-33 truly became a keystone document (e.g., reducing some of the detail and overlapping information contained in other ATPs), with the other ATPs (e.g., ATP-27, -40, and -42) subordinate to it. 43. Stein, Nolan, and Perry, 7–10. 44. ATP-33(B), Tactical Air Doctrine,  1 November 1986, 1-1. 45. Further, coordination  authority allows one to require consultation but not to compel agreement. Ibid., 3-2. 46. Ibid., chap. 3. The “B” designation refers to the second complete revision of the document; minor revisions are made via changes. ATP-33(B) incorporating change one is the subject of this section. Change two (January 1992) and the proposed change three (December 1994) are the subject of the section on post-cold-war/post–Gulf War revisions to NATO air doctrine. 47. Ibid., 3-4 through 3-5. 48.

A new pamphlet, discussed in the following section, was published in December 1994. 50. ATP-42, pars. 201–2. 51. Ibid., annex A. 52. Stein argues that other NATO members feared that “statements of operational requirements would follow on the heels of any TAWP upgrading of SEAD’s doctrinal status.” He further points out that the primary objections came from the RAF, Belgium, and the Netherlands, although they, along with
