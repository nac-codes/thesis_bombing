are turned to the harsh realities of our domestic life. 26 Military planners  and politicians firmly believed that nuclear escalation  would destroy the Soviet state. They saw that their previous preemptive doctrine  created a deadly paradox. Rapid conventional success against NATO  on any axis might accelerate NATO ’s nuclear first use—exactly what preemption  was trying to preclude. Thus, the previous Soviet strategic concept contained the seeds of its own destruction. Further, in the 1970s and early 1980s, NATO  leaders perceived the Soviet buildup as threatening and destabilizing. As such, NATO  responded with deliberate political and military measures. The resultant NATO buildup in technologically superior forces and the political will for rapid reinforcement decreased the Soviets’ likelihood of winning a conventional war in the initial period. 27 This produced an economically and technologically draining competition with the Soviet civilian economy. The military capability to carry out preemptive  doctrine became a burden the Soviet economy could not endure. Direct costs imposed by military demands on the workforce, material, and technology  exacerbated the Soviets’ decline on the world’s stage. Finally, the Soviet Union ’s internal political turmoil resulted in the virtual disappearance of Marxist-Leninist ideology from the formation of military doctrine . The Soviets put their view of others on a “back burner” in order to concentrate on their view of themselves. In 1985 the Soviet political leadership redefined military doctrine  to support pressing political, economic, and societal concerns. Under the new doctrine, the defensive operation acted as a precursor to strong conventional counterstrikes, followed by a concentrated counteroffensive. Doctrine  designed the defensive phase as a temporary measure to buy time in the initial period of a conflict. The Soviets would use this time to mobilize, reinforce, and move rear echelons  forward for the counter-THE
