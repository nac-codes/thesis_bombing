s (C 3) infrastructure to facilitate mission execution. 37 The Soviets hoped that the synergy produced by these factors would amount to an order-of-magnitude increase in combat effectiveness. The Soviets envisioned the future battlefield as a high- intensity, dynamic, high-tempo, air-land operation extending over vast land areas and space. The operation orchestrated elements and preplanned fires, maneuver, counterattack forces, and counterstrike forces. Maneuver and countermaneuver ensured the viability of the defense and created conditions favorable to a counteroffensive. Tempo allowed the Soviets to counterattack into the operational depth of the enemy during operational/strategic counteroffensives. One finds an interesting characteristic of this doctrine common to all Soviet military  doctrine. That is, the defense creates a favorable condition to culminate in an offensive. Forces allotted to the defense remained secondary to the counteroffensive, while operational reserves exploited the counteroffensive. More than blunting an attack, the defense became the means to seize the initiative from the aggressor, creating conditions leading to the enemy’s defeat. Counterstrike  and preemption  become keys to seizing the initiative. Although a defensive  doctrine highlighted this era, maintaining offensive capability remained the essence of this defensive doctrine . Therefore, one can view the ideas of the “strategic defensive” and counteroffensive as the same doctrinal concept. Soviet Military Doctrine Stereotype Throughout its evolution, Soviet military  doctrine took on certain primary characteristics, albeit in many forms. But in looking at the doctrine  closely, we see a persistent and recurrent theme involving offensive action—the doctrinal template the Soviets applied when the air phase of the GulfFELKER 495  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 519 --- War  began in January 1991 and the comparative paradigm they used to measure Western military performance
