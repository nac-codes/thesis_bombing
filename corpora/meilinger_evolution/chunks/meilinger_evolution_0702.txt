In the strategic-operational plan, the high command of forces organized on one or more strategic axes in a TVD .38 Operational commanders within this TVD  aimed to destroy the enemy and weaken his political alliances. The weakest points of the enemy received the major blows, and in areas likely to receive counterattacks, friendly forces built defenses. Envelopment would destroy the enemy. The key to the strategic-operational plan lay in achieving significant tactical superiority  in a strike sector where the main blow fell, while accepting local inferiority in passive or secondary sectors not coming under attack. Soviet military planners  stressed that only the offensive could achieve victory. Seizing the initiative at the outset of hostilities, before the enemy could fully deploy, offered the Soviets the best opportunity to mass forces to break through the enemy’s prepared defenses. The Offensive.  Successful deep operations required simultaneous fire suppression of the enemy throughout the depth of the defense, rapid penetration, and high-speed, deep attacks to achieve the objective as quickly as possible. 39 Motorized rifle, tank, and air-assault forces characterized these high-speed strikes. Echeloning forces built pressure on the weakest sector. Generally, combined-arms armies made up the first echelon of a front, containing the bulk of its forces, with tank armies normally in the second echelon. The mission of this first echelon was to overcome the enemy’s defenses and attack through to the immediate operational depths. The front’s second echelon, normally one army, exploited the success of the first echelon and continued the main thrusts to the subsequent objective. Thus, a significant force remaine
