To achieve parity, the Soviets assumed that having the same number of weapons as their adversary created stability. For 40 years, they had emphasized quantity, but in the 1980s Marshal Ogarkov  emphasized quality and high technology . He redefined the type of war the Soviets might realistically envision and the adjustments they might have to make to their military art .54 The Gulf War  heightened and clarified the implication of future war  and the development of Soviet weapons .

Maj Gen Vladimir Slipchenko  of the General Staff noted that advanced-technology  weapons created a military- technical revolution  in military affairs.

Rather than an incremental tactical-operational/strategic progression, strategic goals
