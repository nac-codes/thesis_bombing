occupy enemy territory.” 56 The General Staff determined that local conflicts could lead to strategic victories. Rather than an incremental tactical-operational/strategic progression, strategic goals may become the first ones attained in future war . The staff saw a serious danger, since local conflicts generate a different set of military-political objectives than do bloc struggles; thus, the old concepts of struggles for national survival and unconditional surrender were no longer operative. In many ways, the Soviets saw this situation as a cause of direct US involvement and of their own indirect involvement in a dispute among Iraq , Kuwait , and Saudi Arabia . The General Staff argued that preemption  offered the only way to avoid defeat in progressively threatening situations against a powerful opponent because the military would have no time to develop a defensive phase while preparing for a viable counteroffensive. 57 This course of action became particularly important if the opponent waged an air operation similar in size and scope to that in the Gulf War . The war vividly displayed the new strategic importance of the initial period. If the fighting involved high-tech precision munitions , the Soviets realized that the initial period might decide the war rather than simply influence its outcome and length. Future weapons  capitalized on the qualities of speed, mobility, lethality, and accuracy, thereby significantly increasing the value of two of the Soviets’ prized principles of war—surprise and initiative.

General of the Army N. Klokotov  noted that “Iraq  made a strategic error. Its forces were prepared for a battle in which the means of ‘strike’ were preem
