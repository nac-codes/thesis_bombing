sues. Consequently, some junior officers in attendance noted that most of the interesting and compelling comments occurred “in the lobby.” Some of the core issues they thought needed attention included the “lamentable condition” of Soviet military science and defense preparations and the failure of their air defense organization (PVO)  to provide them with “the most modern systems available.” They also commented about the need to replace “obsolete models of weapons that accomplish little, as evidenced by the Gulf War .”80 Influenced by the coalition ’s success in the Gulf War , Defense Minister Andrei S. Grachev  listed the following seven priority items for continued R&D : highly mobile troops; army aviation ; long-range ACMs ; command, control, communications, and intelligence (C 3I) systems; space systems; air defense  systems; and strategic arms.81 As a result of the General Staff’s analysis of the Gulf War , political and military leaders reached a consensus on maintaining R&D  at the expense of procurement, as the Russian defense budget  shrinks. The Russians believe they cannot “be second best” in stealth  and ACMs ,82 noting that they were seven to 10 years behind in the latter. After talking to the editorial staff of Voennaia mysl  in April 1992, Ben Lambeth  deduced some broad outlines of the High Command’s thinking as regards the meaning of Operation Desert Storm . Four recurrent themes emerged that should affect R&D : (1) the broadened role played by conventional airpower in deciding war’s outcome; (2) the criticality of good training and operator proficiency in getting the most out of modern weaponry; (3) the disproportionate leverage offered by high-tech weapons  as a force multiplier ; and (4) the meaningFELKER 507  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 531 --- of these and related findings for future Russian defense planning  and policy. 83 According to Lambeth , the Russians concluded that the nature of modern war had changed radically in the l
