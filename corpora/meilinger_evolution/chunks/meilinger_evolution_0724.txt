Specifically, the old doctrine  had emphasized the prevention of war by repelling aggression, and the new doctrine  specified optimized forces forTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 512  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 536 --- all possible wars and combat missions. 103 The new doctrine’s main objective entailed “localiz[ing] a seat of tension and terminat[ing] military operations at the earliest possible stage in the interests of creating preconditions . . . on conditions that accord with the interests of the Russian Federation . . . .
