atus in the world, the condition of the CIS , and the domestic situation. A close reading of the Russian Federation ’s draft military doctrine shows a clear danger of Russian military policy moving divergently from foreign  and domestic policies. Notes 1.

Gareev, “On Military Doctrine and Military Reform in Russia,” Journal of Soviet Military Studies,  December 1992, 540. 3. Doctrine (voennaia doctrina),  as defined by the Soviets, has two important framing aspects: sociopolitical and military-technical. The military policy of the Communist Party expressed the sociopolitical aspect, based on a classic Marxist-Leninist view of the world. Its ideas about the political essence of modern war stemmed from the nature of the Soviet state and social system, and from historical principles of military organizational development. It took account of the international correlation of forces and a scientifically based thesis on the psychological and moral-political nature of the people. The military-technical aspect determines the character of the military threat and the type of armed struggle to be fought. It serves as the basis for determining defense requirements and needs of the armed forces. Further, it establishes the means to conduct armed struggle and prepare the armed forces to accomplish their missions and tasks. See Timothy L.
