An interesting observation by Kipp pertains to the impact of arms sales on the overall Russian economy. Since industrial plant costs were already accrued (sunk costs) and with labor costs also very low, military sales were actually making money and stimulating the economy. Although one central theme of this essay holds that the Russian economy will have a deleterious effect on the Russian military, Kipp’s reasoning might at first appear to counter that notion. It might prove interesting to consider how much of the Russian military the politicians are willing to sell for this temporary economic stimulation. I do not believe that the Russians will “mortgage the state” at the expense of the military.
