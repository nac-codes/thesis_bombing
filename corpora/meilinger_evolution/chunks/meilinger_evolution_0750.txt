roles and missions . Corres pond- ingly, the Army , Navy , and Air Force  organize, train, and equip the joint war-fighting command. If an examination of the characteristics of airpower and space power  shows great similarity among them, one can accept the aerospace power conjecture—which would prove extremely useful, since one could build space power theory upon 50 years of airpower theory. 5 One could embed space responsibility in the very strong culture of the Air Force — currently the de facto approach. If, on the other hand, examination of the characteristics of airpower and space power  yields significant differences, then one must reject the aerospace power conjecture. Perhaps drawing from the more general principles of airpower, land power , and sea power theory, one would then have to build space power  theory from its foundations. The most prudent, unbiased means of accomplishing this would require a distinct Space Force . In the following discussion, the novelty—not the relative importance—of space power  warrants the emphasis on space- related issues.DEBLOIS 531  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 555 --- Roles and Missions A role is a general military objective, while the mission is the means of accomplishing it. Missions are options—not laundry lists of what forces always do—and the role/mission pairing is not exclusive. 6 Current Air Force doctrine emphasizes war-fighting roles  and missions 7 but overlooks the operationalization of the strategic aspects of the “global presence ” concept. “The foundation of this approach is power projection . Power projection is a means to influence actors or affect situations or events in America ’s national interests. It has two components: warfighting and presence.” 8 The concept of presence used here explicitly connotes the idea of being in the environment (physically or virtually). Further, it implicitly connotes the idea of global watchfulness or vigilance. The following six roles and missions , created
