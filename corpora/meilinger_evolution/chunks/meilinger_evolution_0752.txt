All forms of military power have the peacetime responsibilities of presence and vigilance. Primary wartime objectives of airpower, land power , sea power , and space power  include providing force enhancement  and force support  to facilitate both realm control and the potential of force application . If one can find a distinction between space power  and the other forms of military power within the context of general roles and missions , it lies in the role of force application . Airpower, land power , and sea power  are all currently capable of force application and have historical precedents for its use. Furthermore, although aircraft were initially used for surveillance  and reconnaissance  in a support role, ever since the strategic doctrinal conception of airpower, people have viewed it primarily as an offensive application  of force.14 But the capability of space power  force application  remains unproven, and no precedent exists for its use. The force application  role from space may never be politically palatable because it is “unilaterally forbidden by congressional mandateDEBLOIS 533  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 557 --- (e.g. prohibition against deploying an anti-satellite system), and curtailed by international treaties (e.g. the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty ).”15 Even as a mental construct, force application  from space does not begin with the primacy of the offensive. In fact, current technological pursuits and funding emphasize the use of space weapons
