Space Policy Emotional, legal, and rational political considerations directly affect the will to use space power  and, as such,THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 534  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 558 --- influence standing US space policy . Indeed, they have the effect of putting the political will to weaponize space very much in question. Emotional Factor Competing schools of thought lie at the root of the debate over space weaponization . In his book On Space Warfare, 18 Lt Col David Lupton  summarizes four competing schools of thought that surfaced during the 1980s, when the issue of weaponizing space  received a great deal of publicity. The Sanctuary School views space as a realm free of military weapons but allows for military-related systems that provide the functions of treaty verification, intelligence activities, and so forth. Advocates maintain that the only way to ensure the legal overflight aspect of current space treaties is to declare space as a war-free zone or sanctuary. This school calls for virtually no funding of military space programs aimed at weaponizing  space. The Sanctuary School of thought has a substantial following in the domestic and international populace, though many people within the military see it as a “head in the sand” approach to national security . The Survivability School also argues that military forces should deemphasize space access , but for less idealistic reasons. It assumes that space forces are inherently exposed and vulnerable. Survivability adherents assert that the probability of using nuclear weapons  in the remoteness of space is higher than in other media. This notion—along with the fact that weapons effects have longer ranges outside an inhibiting atmosphere, as well as the inherent vulnerability of predictable orbit locations—supports the survivability position. Remoteness also allows for plausible deniability of the attacker, which increases the probability of attack. The Survivability
