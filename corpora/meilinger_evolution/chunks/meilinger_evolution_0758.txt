From a broader perspective, investment in expensive space weapons  creates an opportunity cost; trade-offs with more conventional military systems become a significant consideration. The difficult matter of verification, which remains a concern, was a prime motivator behind the US rejection of several Soviet treaty proposals to control space weapons  in the early 1980s. 23 The bureaucratic decision process that combines the emotional, legal, and rational factors into a coherent space policy  is complex.
