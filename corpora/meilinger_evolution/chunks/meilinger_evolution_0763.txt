the air affords reliable precision and reduced collateral damage : limited risk to collateral personnel is a characteristic advantage of airpower. Political characteristics of military power are transient; that is, they exist by human convention and are subject to change. Although the similarities or distinctions between airpower and space power  suggested by these characteristics remain transient, they are currently real considerations and will probably not change significantly in the near future. Several more characteristics, which owe their existence to human convention, involve the way people have chosen to develop and employ military systems and operations.THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 542  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 566 --- Development and Employment Characteristics of Military Power After considering the political merits of airpower and space power , one may logically begin analyzing them by examining their technological development and the means by which one uses them (employment). Research, development, operational insertion, and command/control/execution constitute the process by which emerging technologies  integrate with and contribute to military power. Basic research and development (R&D)  and operational insertion methods are similar for air, land, and sea services, as dictated by the DOD  acquisition system. Features of this process that could highlight similarities or distinctions between airpower and space power include relative technology  dependence and philosophies of command and control (C 2) and execution. Technology Dependence The development of air and space technology  is virtually synonymous with high technology . Humans have existed in the land and sea realms for thousands of years. Although technological advance remains crucial to exploiting both realms, people do not need it to access them. In contrast, people have needed high technology  to provide air and space access from the outset. Investment in high-technology R&D  is essen
