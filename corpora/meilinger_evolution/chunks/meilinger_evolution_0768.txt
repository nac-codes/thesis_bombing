space is a centralized buffer with automated or screened prioritization, which detracts from the autonomy of any one regional commander. Both cost and capability optimization of space assets drive centralized control  and centralized execution . Airpower, on the other hand, does not have to make the autonomy/efficiency trade-off. Most airpower assets are not national assets with near-instantaneous global reach . As such, efficient operation warrants assigning air assets to regional commanders, an arrangement that affords both efficient centralized control and offers lower-level commanders/operators the tactical flexibility of decentralized execution . Decentralized execution  is a characteristic advantage of airpower. Consideration of the political and development/employment characteristics of military power has revealed severalTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 546  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 570 --- distinctions and similarities between airpower and space power . But these characteristics have resided in human creations— politics, laws, development methods, and employment plans. More fundamental to the comparison is the physical nature of the two realms. Realm-Access Characteristics of Military Power Technological advances in aerodynamics, materials, propulsion, guidance, and control all facilitated access to the air realm at the turn of the twentieth century. Similarly, in astrodynamics, ongoing studies of forces and motion in space suggest that proliferated access  to the space realm is near at hand. But one should remain cautious about such technological optimism: “Scientists and engineers now know how to build a station in space that would circle the Earth 1,075 miles up. . . . Within the next 10 or 15 years, the Earth will have a new companion in the skies, a man-made satellite that could be either the greatest force for peace ever devised, or one of the most terrible weapons of war—depending on who makes and controls it.” 38 Surprisingly, those comments ca
