an-made satellite that could be either the greatest force for peace ever devised, or one of the most terrible weapons of war—depending on who makes and controls it.” 38 Surprisingly, those comments came from Wernher von Braun, speaking in 1952. Relatively recent experience with understanding the air realm, together with the ability to rapidly overcome air-flight-related technical obstacles, naturally led to the same expectation for spaceflight-related technical obstacles. The experiences of the last 45 years with space research  have emphasized a real difference between understanding a theoretical environment and building systems to gain physical access  to it. The air access–space access  analogy breaks down for several reasons: access to the air realm, at the lowest technological level, is as easy as throwing a rock or glider. But space is not a realm to which we have immediate access  or in which we have experience. Prior to specifically addressing the realm-access characteristics of airpower and space power , therefore, one needs some background regarding space-lift  efforts, including significant technical hurdles to space lift , technological development designed to negotiate those hurdles, and theDEBLOIS 547  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 571 --- means by which the United States  nurtures that technological development. Boost to the space realm requires a large amount of energy that must be generated, harnessed, focused, and stabilized. To illustrate the difference in energy requirements for aircraft-type and spacecraft-type operations, one should consider the thrust required to place an F-16  aircraft in to low Earth orbit (LEO) . Scaling the thrust-to-(weight-to-orbit) ratio of the space shuttle  down—or scaling the Atlas thrust-to-(weight-to-orbit) ratio up—yields roughly 1.15 million pounds of thrust required to get an F-16 -sized vehicle with a reasonable payload to LE0 .39 Current air-breathing F-16  engines produce 29,000 pounds of thrust
