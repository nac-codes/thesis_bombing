) ratio up—yields roughly 1.15 million pounds of thrust required to get an F-16 -sized vehicle with a reasonable payload to LE0 .39 Current air-breathing F-16  engines produce 29,000 pounds of thrust 40—roughly one- fortieth the amount required by an F-16 -sized, space- capable, non-air-breathing, rocket-powered spacecr aft. Thus, t hrust requirements provide one indication of th e drastic differences between aircraft and spacecraft technologies . Furthermore, to make the space vehicle F-16 -like for operations, one would need to reconfigure and pull the external, expendable booster stages inside the craft and drastically reduce the elaborate ground-support infrastructure required by current space operations . Aircraft-type operations for a  spacecraft  are easy to imagine, but the analogy hides the fact that from an engineering perspective, aircraft operations and spacecraft operations  differ not merely in the degree of advanced technology  required but differ fundamentally in the kind  required. As a further complication, any means of gaining access  to the space realm must work equally well in the very different environment of the air realm, since one must traverse the atmosphere in order to reach space. The remoteness of space also causes serious maintenance and supportability problems. When aircraft components malfunction, the aircraft lands to be fixed. When aircraft run out of fuel, tankers refuel them in the air, or they land for refueling. Spacecraft  currently have neither of these options. 41 Whether the motive is operations or maintenance and support, access  to space becomes a matter of getting there—and that requires space lift .THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 548  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 572 --- One use of the term lift involves moving something from one place to another. Airlift  and space lift  are similar in this regard. A fundamental difference, however, exists between the two. Physical access  to the space realm is the objective of space
