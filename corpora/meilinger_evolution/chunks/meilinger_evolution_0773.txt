its capacity to produce heat. Since a satellite  in space is thermally isolated, it has no natural means to vent excess energy absorbed from the sun. Without the screening and natural cooling capability of the atmosphere, an object in space quickly overheats on the sunlit side. Resolution requires a technological means of collecting excess energy and radiating it back into space. Balancing the level of heat in any spaceborne system  presents a difficultTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 550  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 574 --- problem—even more so if that system must meet the very narrow tolerances for sustaining human life. Aside from heat, surges of electromagnetic energy—often due to solar flares associated with solar or cosmic radiation, radio bursts, proton events, and geomagnetic storms—can also pose a threat. High-energy solar or cosmic radiation can prove lethal to humans, while radio bursts, proton events, and geomagnetic storms can interrupt communications. Another space hazard involves energetically charged particles that often become trapped in magnetic fields associated with planets or stars (suchTable 1 The Changing Atmospheric Medium Altitude (km) Density (d)/Density at Sea Level (d 0) 0 d0 = 10 18 particles/cm 3 5 d = .492 x d 0 (one-half of Earth’s atmosphere is below this) 10 d = .242 x d 0 (supplemental oxygen required for respiration) 15 d = .119 x d 0 (supplemental pressure and oxygen required for respiration) 24 d = .033 x d 0 (compressing external air is no longer economical; humans require self-contained environments) 32 d = .011 x d 0 (operating limit of turbojet engines) 45 d = .002 x d 0 (operating limit of ramjet engines) 100 d = 10 12 particles/cm 3 (aerodynamic effects become insignificant) 1,000 d = 10 5 particles/cm 3 2,000+ d = one particle/cm 3 (the “hard vacuum” of space)DEBLOIS 551  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 575 --- as Earth’s Van Allen radiation belts). These particles can pose serious threats to space systems
