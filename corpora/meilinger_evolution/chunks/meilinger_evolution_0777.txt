asses roughly 3.13 x 10 14 km 3—more than six thousand times the operating environment of the atmosphere. 50 As technology  advances and “near Earth” comes to encompass the Moon, the operating space environment increases a thousandfold beyond GEO . The larger the size of the realm, the more potential for freedom of movement and military operations. The size of the realm is a characteristic advantage of space power . Position of the Realm The relative position of the realm with respect to other realms is an important environmental characteristic. Because the space environment encloses the air environment, space operations  have a tactical advantage over air operations. The space environment also has an energy advantage because it maintains the high ground. If one overlooks the access problem previously addressed, space power  enjoys an obvious advantage due to elevation. The relative position of the realm is a characteristic advantage of space power . If the environmental characteristics of the air and space realms are so drastically different, why such a strong effort to merge the two? In order to justify exploitation of the aerospace environment as a unified whole, AFM 1-1 points to the fact that no absolute boundary  exists between air and space. The authors erroneously assert that the distinction between land, sea, and aerospace forces is attributable to a clear boundary between each. They further propose that since a clear boundary  does not exist between air and space, one can make no such distinction. 51 But the distinction between military realms is based on the nature of the environment—not on theTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 554  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 578 --- boundaries between them. The flawed logic of AFM 1-1 probably results from creating evidence to support a decision already made—specifically, consumption of space roles and missions  by the Air Force . Unsurprisingly, an initial draft of AFDD 1, which clearly separated air and space without
