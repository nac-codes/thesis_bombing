to support a decision already made—specifically, consumption of space roles and missions  by the Air Force . Unsurprisingly, an initial draft of AFDD 1, which clearly separated air and space without ever using the term aerospace,  was disapproved. But the term dominates the latest draft version of AFDD 1 (14 May 1996), which is now on the verge of acceptance. 52 The only difference between the air and space environments is altitude and/or level of technology  required to operate within the realm.  The fundamental flaw in such an argument rests in the very different mediums. The air realm, which varies continuously with altitude, is dense with substance, screened from cosmic radiation, and confined to an area within 100 km of the Earth’s surface. The space realm, however, is a constant, void of substance, immersed in radiation, and literally infinite in dimension. If substance density is a valid gauge, the difference between the air and space realm is a factor of 1,018; if size is the criterion, the difference is far greater. Differences in composition and size require significant differences in the technological means of conquering those mediums. The technological requirements that distinguish flying in air from traversing space are more profound than the distinction between motion in water and traversing the atmosphere. Both sea and air travel involve progressing through a medium of substance, whereas space travel involves motion within a void. Scientists and engineers have a more difficult time merging air and space environments as compared to merging air and sea environments, yet one hears nothing of “aerosea” power. The man-made political, development, and employment characteristics, as well as the inherent realm-environment characteristics of military power significantly distinguish space power  from airpower. Correspondingly, these differences drive different capabilities. Realm-Afforded Capability Characteristics of Military Power Autonomy of operation, surv
