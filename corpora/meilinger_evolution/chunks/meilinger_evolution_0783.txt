to LEO , they will not have access to deep-space locations. Considerable time may pass before the range extension of space power  exceeds that of airpower, particularly in a strike capacity. Inherently, though, range is a characteristic advantage of space power . Maneuver A satellite  in LEO  (200 km) travels at roughly 7,790 meters per second (17,425 MPH). 59 A small satellite  (100 kg) traveling at this speed has the kinetic energy roughly equivalent to an F-16  traveling at Mach 2 (sea level). 60 Unlike the F-16 , however, the satellite  has no air on which to maneuver or slow down, and because it is so expensive to lift fuel to space, satellites typically have very little energy available to provide on-orbit thrust, which in turn equates to maneuverability. The cross-range capability of satellites  is so low, in fact, that the most maneuverable, powered, space concepts—the current reusable launch vehicle (RLV)  designs—allow only for eleven hundred miles of lateral maneuver capability.61 This essay has already mentioned the incredible costs incurred by lifting mass (fuel) to orbit for such maneuvers. These are daunting obstacles; as such, the virtual immobility of spaceborne assets from fixed orbit stands as their biggest drawback. Maneuver is a characteristic advantage of airpower. Flexibility System flexibility equates to options. Spacecraft  options as compared to aircraft options are severely limited on several counts: 1. As discussed, the energy cost of maneuvering  space assets reduces the number of target options.DEBLOIS 559  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 583 --- 2. The energy cost of access to space  inhibits satellite reconfiguration, resulting in a lack of reconnaissance and strike options. One can reconfigure aircraft prior to launch in order to meet particular situational needs. In the event of a crisis, most of the space power  available is already present; satellite strike and reconnaissance capabilities are not reconfigurable without
