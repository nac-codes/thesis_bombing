Of course, whatever one can do from the remoteness of space, one can also accomplish from the air, without the need to radiate the energy to the platform—exactly the approach of the airborne laser. Although space strike  may prove more responsive, firepower capability from space has significant limitations. Assuming a surface target, the proximity of the air realm provides firepower as  a characteristic advantage of airpower. Stealth Because of their close proximity to the surface, aircraft are exposed to low-technology, surface-based threats such as antiaircraft artillery  and surface-to-air  missiles. Their exposure, however, is transient and limited by various unpredictable factors: timing, flight path, velocity, maneuverability, stealth technology , and weather. The high speed and remote aspects of spacecraft  clearly provide certain security advantages. A spacecraft  in ne ar- circular LEO  with an apogee and perigee of approximately 2,128 miles travels a set path at a known velocity of roughly 17,420 MPH, while a satellite  in a near-circular GEO  (22,241 miles) requires a velocity of 6,880 MPH to remain stationary, relative to the Earth’s surface. 69 But as technical access to space  proliferates, the advantages of remote speed give way to the disadvantages of predictable locations and paths. Physical cluster areas at LEO , GEO , and Lagrange  points 70 also add to the exposure of space assets. Additionally, the absence of an inhibiting atmosphere greatly extends space-based sensing capability and weapons effects, further complicating the space-security issue. Historically, space support based in
