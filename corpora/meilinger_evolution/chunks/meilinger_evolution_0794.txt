de the potential for force application  from space. Aspects of each service culture should contribute to that theoretical and doctrinal development: we must plan to fight while living and operating in a hostile environment (Navy ), from a fixed, possibly fortified position/orbit (Army ), and achieve the objective by force application  from the third dimension (Air Force ). The dominant nature of the last element, together with the fact that one must traverse the air in order to reach space, currently gives the Air Force  a lead role in developing space systems .76 The Air Force  is clearly the primary player in military space, having an estimated budget of $2.6 billion for fiscal year 1996, as compared to projected Army  spending of $110 million and Navy  spending of $120 million. 77THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 568  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 592 --- An often overlooked spin-off of the notion of a separate Space Force , however, carries good news for the Air Force . As noted, space power  has some attributes that airpower cannot match, but the opposite is also true. The danger of the Air Force â€™s holding on to responsibility for space is that it will lose sight of the very necessary and unique capabilities that airpower, apart from space power , provides. In addition to losing focus on airpower organization and doctrine , the Air Force  will inevitably shortchange airpower if it tries to hold on to space in terms of organizing, training, and equipping space forces, despite limited funding. 78 Segregating airpower and space power  is a good move for both, leaving experts in each to decide how best to develop theory and doctrine  and subsequently invest in supporting organization, training, and equipment. How Because the standard military acquisitions  approach for investment in space power  may be premature, the following suggestion may have some merit: Given the enormity of the physical problems discussed and the opportunity afforded by the collapse of a majo
