investment in space power  may be premature, the following suggestion may have some merit: Given the enormity of the physical problems discussed and the opportunity afforded by the collapse of a major threat, perhaps the United States  ought to spend more of its current space budget  on space-related education, training, and R&D , as opposed to operations and procurement . If technological difficulties are enormous now and if theoretical technical advances continue at the current pace, it makes sense that access  to space will become much cheaper in the future. Rather than producing next-generation dinosaurs, it is better to put money into R&D  that will benefit the United States  25 years from now. Objections to the effect that this would mean abandoning the defense technological  and industrial base (DTIB)  are unfounded. All fiscal decisions affect the DTIB . The question is not one of supporting the DTIB  but of deciding what part of the DTIB  to support: near-term manufacturing/production lines and operations or education, science, and R&D  leading to long-term capabilities. The idea of a flawed approach that leads to the misallocation of limited military resources (i.e., trying to do too much too soon) is not new. The Third Reich made enormous investments in rocket technology —to theDEBLOIS 569  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 593 --- benefit of technology  and to the detriment of Germany : “The technical fascination of being able to break through traditional limits . . . had overwhelmed any rigorous analysis of its likely impact. The most fundamental flaw in their thinking lay in the lack of any well-thought-out strategic concept of how the missile could actually affect the course of the war. It was the product of a narrow technological vision that obscured the strategic bankruptcy of the concept.” 79 At many military “futures and technology ” conferences, the space technology  of choice always assumes space weaponization in the form of various sy
