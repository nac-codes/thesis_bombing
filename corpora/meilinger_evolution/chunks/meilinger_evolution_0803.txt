asset but physically isolated from the battlefield by virtue of being based in the continental United States. 34. AFDD 4, 22 May 1996,  3. 35.

Wernher von Braun, “Man Will Conquer Space Soon,” Collier’s, 22 March 1952, 1. One should note that, at the time, the Van Allen radiation belts had yet to be discovered. Von Braun did not realize that an orbit at an altitude of 1,075 miles would be a dangerous place to put a space colony. This raises another caution regarding our lack of experience in space: what else don’t we know? 39. The shuttle carries its empty weight of 105,000 kg and a maximum payload of 21,140 kg to LEO (204 km, 28.45 °) and uses a total launch thrust of 7,781,400 pounds (6,600,000 pounds in the first two minutes contributed by the solid-rocket expendables, and 1,181,400 pounds over the first eight minutes and 50 seconds by the orbiter main engines). An Atlas II can place 6,000 kg in a similar orbit with its 485,000 pounds of launch thrust. Jane’s Space Directory  (Alexandria, Va.: Jane’s Information Group Ltd., 1995), 274. Placing an empty F-16 (11,300 kg) and a reasonable payload (3,700 kg) in the same location via a shuttle-type approach requires 15/105 the thrustTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 574  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 598 --- of the shuttle—roughly 1.1 million pounds. Placing an empty F-16 and reasonable payload in the same location using an Atlas-type approach requires 15/6 the thrust of the Atlas—roughly 1.2 million pounds. 40. The 29,000 pounds of thrust of the F-16’s General Electric F110-GE-129 engine is at sea level; thrust declines slowly with increasing altitude, and the mass density of air above 20 miles will cause the engine to flame out. 41. The space shuttle does have a capability to service and/or retrieve spacecraft, but it is neither efficient nor responsive. 42. One can make a good argume
