miles will cause the engine to flame out. 41. The space shuttle does have a capability to service and/or retrieve spacecraft, but it is neither efficient nor responsive. 42. One can make a good argument that if spacecraft are small and cheap and if launch is fast and cheap, satellites ought to be replaced—not recovered and repaired. The counterargument is (1) those are big ifs and (2) one would eventually have to deal with an abundance of throwaway space systems because they would clutter LEO. 43. Theo Pirard, “Space Ambitions in a Changing World,” Spaceflight, January 1996, 2. 44. Density = exp(–mgz/kT), where z is altitude, m is the molecular weight in kg of air, g is the local acceleration of gravity, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is temperature (degrees Kelvin). 45. R. McNutt, “Orbiting Space Debris: Dangers, Measurement and Mitigation” (Hanscom AFB, Mass.: Phillips Laboratory Directorate of Geophysics, 1992). 46. Although the “air” has one-millionth the density at LEO as opposed to sea level, the net accumulation of drag effects at LEO can become significant over the extended duration of satellite lifetimes. 47. Integrating acceleration of 32 ft/s 2 with respect to time (t), velocity = 32t ft/s, and integrating this again with respect to t, distance = 16t 2 ft. Note: 88 ft/s = 60 MPH. 48. The propulsion benefit of lift in the atmosphere does come at the cost of drag. The example demonstrates that the benefit clearly outweighs the cost. 49. Harrier in CAP: 1.5 hrs. Stationary Harrier, with the same fuel load as the CAP Harrier (2 x 228 gal external tanks + 757 gal internal) = 1,213 gal, at ~ 6 lb/gal ⇒ ~7,300 lb of fuel. The Harrier’s Pegasus 11-61 engine takeoff performance rating is 23,800 lb of thrust, while an optimistic estimate of its specific fuel consumption is .8 lb/hr for every pound of thrust. The burn rate for a stationary Harrier is about .8 x 23,800 = 19,040 lb per hour. With 7,300 lb of fuel, the Harrier could stay in such a position for roughl
