ion is .8 lb/hr for every pound of thrust. The burn rate for a stationary Harrier is about .8 x 23,800 = 19,040 lb per hour. With 7,300 lb of fuel, the Harrier could stay in such a position for roughly 23 minutes.  Jane’s Atlas of the World’s Aircraft (Alexandria, Va.: International Thomson Publishing Company, 1995). 50. The volume of a sphere of radius r is V r = (4/3)7 πr3. Using the radius of the Earth r e = 6,371 km, the volume of the atmosphere below 100 km is V100 = V 6,471  -V6,371  = 5.18 x 10 10 km 3, and the volume of space out to GEO is VGEO  = V 42,157  – V6,471  = 3.13 x 10 14 km 3. 51.
