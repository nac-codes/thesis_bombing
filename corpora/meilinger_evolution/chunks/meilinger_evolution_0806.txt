Circular Keplarian Orbital Velocity: V c = (m eG/rs)1/2 where Earth mass: m e = 5.974 x 10 24 kg, Earth radius: r e = 6,371 km, Satellite orbital radius: r s = re + altitude, and Newton’s gravitational constant G = 6.673 x 10 –11 Nm 2/(kg 2) Orbital Velocity LEO (200 km): 7,789 m/s ~ 17,425 MPH 60. Kinetic energy, or work done against inertia, is the appropriate measure since the inertia of the satellite must be maneuvered. Mach 2 at low altitude ~ 1,440 MPH or ~ 645 m/s Kinetic energy KE = (1/2)mv 2: KEsat = (1/2) x 100 kg x (7,800 m/s) 2 ~ 3 x 10 9 Nm KEF-16  = (1/2) x 14,625 kg x (645 m/s) 2 ~ 3 x 10 9 Nm 61. M. Rampino, Maxwell AFB, Ala., interviewed by author, January 1996. The figure mentioned is not an eleven-hundred-mile lateral movement in orbit capability. It refers to lift-and-drag-aided RLV maneuverability within the atmosphere, minimizing the more expensive proposition of spending fuel to change orbit. 62. This assumes that the right satellites are in the right orbit (limitation of maneuver) with the right capability (limitation of flexibility) and that those satellites can precisely acquire the right target (limitation of precision). 63.
