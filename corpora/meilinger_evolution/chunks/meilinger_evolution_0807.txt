Wesson, Air Force Wright Labs, Eglin AFB, Fla., telephone interview by author, February 1996. Tritonal has 120–125 percent of the explosive power of TNT, while state-of-the-art conventional explosives—including experimental APET-257 and PWX MOD19—have demonstrated explosive capability on the order of 140 percent of TNT. Surprisingly, few if any new explosive materials have presented themselves since World War II. Current research efforts basically address evolutionary improvements to TNT derivatives. 67.

Circular Keplarian Orbital Velocity calculation yields Orbital Velocity GEO (35,786 km): 3,075 m/s ~ 6,880 MPH Orbital Velocity LEO (204 km): 7,787 m/s ~ 17,420 MPH 70. Lagrange points are gravity wells in space—equilibrium points that remain stationary with respect to the rotating coordinate frame. Five naturally occur in the near-Earth/Moon environment. 71. As defined by Carl von Clausewitz, genius affords human decision making based on wisdom and requires intellect, experience, and bold moral character.  On War, ed.

One could also make a good argument that functional commands could take on the responsibility of organizing, training, and equipping all forces (i.e., provide the money). This would be a dramatic shift, since the services would be relegated to operational corps status. As such, the new Space Force already exists in the form of US Space Command. This essay, however, does not address this level
