Paths of Heaven  is about that intellectual dimension, beliefs, and the manner in which military people and scholars have conceptualized the way they would exploit the air weapon as it has evolved in the twentieth century. Some people have been rigorously disciplined in their thinking; others have not, clearly reflecting the limitations of their thought processes and, by implication, their deficiencies in education. When one attempts to grapple with the problem of how these thinkers, especially officers in the different services at various times, have tried to integrate technological innovations effectively in their organizations, the crucial importance of professional military education  becomes clear.
