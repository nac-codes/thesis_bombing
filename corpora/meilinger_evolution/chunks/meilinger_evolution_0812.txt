effort. Even from the vantage point of hindsight, it is easy to see how completely this line of thinking under- estimated the scope of population control in an authoritarian state. Although RAF  thinking about airpower contained flaws, there was also a good deal of sound thinking based on the experience of World War I —as revealed by Jack Slessor ’sHOLLEY 581  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 605 --- writings. His perceptions on the need for close cooperation with ground forces  and the utility of collocating air and ground headquarters were fully certified by World War II . Nonetheless, one is left aghast at the extent to which unchallenged assumptions permeated RAF  official thinking, given that the very survival of the nation almost certainly hinged on the soundness of its airpower. Was Billy Mitchell , “the messiah of American airpower” (p. 80), any more rigorous in his thinking than his RAF contemporaries? The present-day United States Air Force  has made an icon of Mitchell , but a close reading of his writing shows how shallow his analysis actually was. Moreover, his most spectacular accomplishment, sinking the battleship Ostfriesland , involved—as his naval critics charged, not to put too fine a point on it—cheating. The whole story of the battleship trials is more complex than the popular image of Mitchell ’s triumph. To begin with, the Navy  offered as a target the obsolete battleship Iowa, unmanned and radio-controlled, steaming off the Virginia Capes. Mitchell , well aware of how difficult it would be to find a moving ship, let alone hit it, declined the offer. He preferred a sitting duck. By the agreed-upon terms of the  Ostfriesland  trial, Air Service  bombers  were to make a series of attacks with different weights of bombs, allowing for inspection between bombings. Attacks were to be carried out at a prescribed altitude, above the probable volume of antiaircraft fire if the vessel actually had been manned and defended. Mitchell ignored th
