als of the Popular Front  and the labor unrest that followed, as well as the nationalization of the aircraft industry, all took their toll. The root cause, however, lay in the prevailing perception of airpower. Senior army leaders saw support of the army as the primary mission of aviation . Moreover, the high command was defense oriented, so even after the air arm became a separate service in the 1930s, even modest attempts to foster a strategic role were blunted. Some airmen, inspired by Douhet ’s vision, articulated the notion that strategic bombardment  might have a major role in bringing victory. But in the prevailing climate, which frowned on dissent from established doctrine , scant support existed for any radical shift to offensive strategic aviation . This chill on free discussion is all the more curious in light of the superb educational infrastructure the French military possessed in the École Superior . Was it actually as good as people perceived it to be? Whatever the shortcoming of French theory and practice with regard to aviation , no evidence shows that it had significant impact one way or another on airpower theory in the United States  during the interwar years. Although Douhet ’s vision of strategic bombardment  had both direct and indirect impacts on US thought, this was not true for most other Italian theory and practice during the interwar years. In a cynical display of early “political correctness,” Air Marshal Italo Balbo  paid lip service to Douhet , who was a favorite of Mussolini , but put into practice the concepts of Gen Amedeo Mecozzi , which favored army support over an independent, strategic role for aviation. The Italian air force  performed effectively in its army-support role in Spain , thus seeming to confirm the validity of Mecozzi ’s theories. A massive strategic bombardment  of Barcelona , ordered by Mussolini , not only failed to break the will of the Catalonians but stiffened their resistance. This may have persuaded Mecozzi
