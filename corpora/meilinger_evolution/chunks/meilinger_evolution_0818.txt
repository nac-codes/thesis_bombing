ations of Europe  offered substantial affirmation to the prevailing notion of the US Army General Staff that the principal function of aviation was to support ground forces . In the United States , the air arm was still a part of the Army . The experience of World War I  had convinced Army leaders that aviation remained a vital component—absolutely necessary to survival. For that reason, they clung tenaciously to retaining control of air assets. They were not totally blind to the concept of strategic bombing , but their views of what this constituted tended to be more restricted to Army  concerns than were the views of airmen. If Army  leaders seemed less than enthusiastic about strategic air , one must admit that they had some good reasons for their stand. During the war, strategic bombing  had failed to measure up to the brash claims and expectations of Billy Mitchell  and others. In one notable incident, a flight of American Expeditionary Force (AEF)  bombers  into Germany had become disoriented and mistakenly landed on a German airfield. The Germans, with an uncharacteristic sense of humor, sent a message across Allied lines saying, “Thanks for the airplanes, but what should we do with the flight commander?” The nub of the difficulty, of course, lay in the fact that the claims of strategic bombing  visionaries far outstripped the technical capabilities of equipment then available. The situation persisted almost down to the beginning of World War II , when long-range, high-altitude bombers  such as the B-17  became available.THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 586  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 610 --- With the Army  clinging to the air arm as essential to its operations, votaries of Mitchell ’s vision came to believe that only by creating a separate  service would aviation ever be able to prove that it could provide a more efficient route to victory than that offered by conventional surface forces. A rational approach to this goal would seem to call for a campaign
