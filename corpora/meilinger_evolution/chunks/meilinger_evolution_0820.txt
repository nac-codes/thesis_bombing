ACTS  were, for the most part, hardworking officers, brave men, and able pilots. They were not, on the whole, broadly educated. They turned out doctrines  that pursued the Mitchell  vision but largely lacked the necessary authentication. In many respects, their doctrinal pro- mulgations were illusions  (ideas that could not surviveHOLLEY 587  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 611 --- systematic preparation for authentication). The meandering positions taken by both sides in the debate over the issue of escort  fighters for strategic bombers , described in an earlier chapter, are but one example that illustrates the lack of rigor in the thinking of airmen. They confused supposition with fact, and they left unexplored and unanswered assumptions floating in midair. To be sure, some perceptive individuals— students as well as faculty—did on occasion raise skeptical challenges, but these seldom seem to have led to any significant reworking of the official line. In sum, although official and unofficial historians laud ACTS , a close study of the thinking done there in the interwar years can often be an embarrassment to the present-day Air Force . Isn’t it ironic that one finds the portrait of Muir “Santy” Fairchild , the man who had the vision to establish Air University  after World War II , in an obscure position at the back entrance to the magnificent Air University Library. By contrast, Claire Chennault , whose shoddy thinking and self-serving retrospective distortions muddied the doctrinal picture so badly, is memorialized with a prominently placed granite monument. One can only hope that the monument reflects his World War II  leadership of the Flying Tigers —not the quality of his thinking at ACTS  as an airpower theorist . In sum, the officers who advanced airpower theory at the interwar Air Corps Tactical School  were undoubtedly on the right path when they defined the primary objective of the air arm as strategic. But their thinking on how best to impl
