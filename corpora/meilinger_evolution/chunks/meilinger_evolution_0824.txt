the other hand, nations soon learned that the balance of terror—usually presented as the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD) —gave political and military leaders reason to peer over the abyss and draw back. This was deterrence , an aspect of airpower theory not envisioned by the early military theorists . Curiously enough,THE PATHS OF HEAVEN 590  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 614 --- theory in the nuclear  world has remained largely the product of academic scholars rather than military officers and has involved a subtlety of reasoning far more sophisticated than that of the early airpower thinkers. The scholars seemed to turn the equation upside down. Intercontinental missiles  for destroying enemy weapons destabilize because they offer a first-strike  threat, but their launching facilities are vulnerable. By contrast, submarine-launched  missiles, though less accurate, pose a real threat to civilian populations. Thus, they become a stabilizing force because their relative invulnerability makes them available for a second strike. As Karl Mueller observes, this amounts to saying that “being able to kill weapons is bad, while being able to kill people is good” (p. 303). After coming to the obvious conclusion that antiballistic missile (ABM) defenses are destabilizing, we enter treaties to curb their use. This is not a characteristic posture for military men who have generally favored more weapons rather than fewer. But wait. As George Orwell  might have put it, some weapons—at least in the eyes of airmen—seem to be more equal than others. Despite the success of the German V-2 , the Air Force  was slow to enter the missile field. Just before stepping down at the end of World War II , Hap Arnold  was willing to leave missile development to the Army  and the Ordnance Department , saving for the Air Force  only those aircraft that depended upon wings for sustentation. This was but a flagrant example of what Carl Builder  later called the “Icarus S
