and the Ordnance Department , saving for the Air Force  only those aircraft that depended upon wings for sustentation. This was but a flagrant example of what Carl Builder  later called the “Icarus Syndrome ”—the Air Force ’s love affair with the airplane. 3 The story of the Air Force ’s reluctance to fund missile research, even up to the appearance of the capable Minuteman  in the 1960s, underscores this failing. The Soviet success with Sputnik I  in 1957 jarred Air Force thinkers into a reappraisal of intercontinental  missiles. Perhaps even more significant in changing Air Force  thought was the Navy ’s success in developing submarine-launched  inter- continental missiles. A cynic might be inclined to suggest that interservice rivalry may be a more powerful incentive to realistic thinking about airpower than the traditional goad of hostile threat. By the same sort of reasoning, the intense desire to hang on to the airplane has led to some wonderfully imaginative innovations:HOLLEY 591  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 615 --- stealth , standoff weapons , and a whole range of electronic devices to suppress enemy measures, which have certainly gone far in prolonging the useful life of manned aircraft. When low intensity conflicts (LIC)  became especially acute in the 1960s, some casting about occurred in the Air Force  to define the role of airpower in relation to such threats. Not surprisingly, however, given their preoccupation with strategic air war  à outrance, especially against the Soviet Union , Air Force  officers showed remarkably little interest in devising doctrines  appropriate for LIC . No significant airpower thinker emerged with a particular interest in this area. At best, the Air Force  seemed to see its tasks primarily in a supporting role, although the gunship perfected during operations in Vietnam showed promise for the future. The shallowness of the air arm’s interest in its LIC  role may well have stemmed from the fact that the preem
