left to the mercy of a decision by a distant air component commander —especially since the intelligence  for making such decisions would have to come from ground sources. Experience from World War II  had shown that collocation of higher command headquarters could resolve many of these tensions, but the manpower-saving decision to eliminate Army  headquarters threatened this promising solution—at least temporarily. If the Army –Air Force  turf battle had remained merely a debate over theoretical control procedures to be defined in doctrinal manuals, the issue might have continued endlessly. But the issue was not theoretical. The two services operated in an active theater, in NATO , with a realistic cold war  enemy across the border. Further, living within the political realities of multinational NATO  made the Air Force  acutely aware of Clausewitz ’s definition of war as an extension of politics. This may not have induced Air Force  officers to give up their convictions or rewrite their doctrinal manuals, but it certainlyTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 594  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 618 --- did force them to accommodate, at least within NATO , an approved doctrine  on interdiction. The old saw “he who is persuaded against his will is of the opinion still” may be pertinent here. The Air Force  made concessions in the NATO  context but probably did not significantly alter its theory of airpower in so doing. Characteristically, bureaucratic fiefdoms—when confronted with intractable differences—defer rather than resolve them. Were the procedural adjustments—the agreements hammered out between the Army  and the Air Force  and among the constituent member nations of NATO —an expression of airpower theory? Or were they merely an incremental accommodation arrived at by the labors of a multitude of staff officers—conferring, bargaining, and adjusting—with all sides making good-faith efforts to find acceptable common ground, only occasionally digging in their heels whe
