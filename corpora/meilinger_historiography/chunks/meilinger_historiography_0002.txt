Army began its slow and painful appreciation of the new air weapon. He reviews the “Mitchell era” and its influence on the Air Corps and the Air Corps Tactical School, where U.S. air doctrine was formulated. He then examines how World War II ful- filled, modified, and in some cases rejected that doctrine. Futrell then discusses the postwar era when the U.S. Air Force (USAF), like the other services and, indeed, the world in general, struggled to cope with the changes in war caused by nuclear weapons. He shows how these new ideas were rudely shaken by the Vietnam War, and how that war shaped modern concepts of airpower employment. No one has a better under- standing of the USAF’s intellectual history. The research that went into these two volumes is prodigious. Although Futrell’s prose can at times be hard going, this is essential reading for anyone serious about airpower theory and doctrine.  Early Thinking  Most early writers on the military uses of aircraft believed that the most significant impact on military operations would be in reconnais- sance and communications. (This is why the first military aircraft in the United States were assigned to the Army’s Signal Corps.) Examples of these early and guarded treatments include Captain G. L.

P. Hearne, Aerial Warfare (London: Bodley Head, 1909). Hearne recog- nized that aerial reconnaissance would have an enormous effect on armies, because it would more quickly and accurately determine their positions and possible intentions: “aircraft will destroy surprise, and therefore destroy strategy.” This was a prescient preview of the First World W
