1915); Frederick A. Talbot, Aeroplanes and Dirigi- bles of War (London: William Heinemann, 1915), and Edgar C. Middle- ton, Airfare of To-Day and of the Future (London: Constable, 1917).  It is surprising how superficial and/or technical most of the writing on airpower was prior to World War II. Flight was a revolutionary devel- opment in human history. As a result, people found it fascinating, while also being a bit mystified as to what it actually entailed. As a result, most books on aviation began with an obligatory discussion of what makes air- planes fly, a description of lift and drag, the difficulty of directional con- trol, the effects of rain and ice on airframes, etc. After these introductory chapters, authors would then begin to speculate—and they had to spec- ulate because there was so little empirical data to fall back on—regard- ing the future of aviation. Most of these speculative accounts fall into one of two categories: the boy’s adventure story, and the apocalyptic vision of future war. In particularly unfortunate cases, these two categories were combined under one cover. An example of this genre was Major General James E. Fechet, Flying (New York: Century, 1933). Fechet had been the chief of the Air Corps, and thus should have known better, but he nonetheless wrote a distressingly bad book on airpower. One extended quote sums up the message of Flying, as well as of dozens of other such books written during the interwar years:  It takes no gazing into a crystal ball to visualize a huge trade center such as New York City completely paralyzed if not entirely destroyed, razed and depopulated in a single day by a very few flying machines. .. . Obviously the airman, riding so high above the earth that cities look like ant hills, cannot aim his deadly cargo at armed males. All below will be his impartial target . . . the women and chil- dren and working men, extra-military, are the ones who will suffer. Extended areas will be completely depopulated. We
