We may safely fore- cast that the next war will be won or lost by air effort.  This type of writing could hardly inspire people into liking airpower and seeing it as a boon to mankind. Nonetheless, it is surprising how often airmen argued that airpower was a civilizing and humane instru- ment because it would make war so awful that it was less likely to occur. This logic was not entirely ridiculous—modern nuclear deterrence strat-  470 x THE JOURNAL OF  Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.
