Because aircraft could travel in any direction, at any altitude, and at any time, they would enjoy the advantage of tactical surprise. This in turn meant they could not be intercepted or stopped. The only defense against air attack was a good offense—countries would be deterred from attacking out of fear of enemy air retaliation. Further, he maintained that this was such a radical new way of thinking about warfare, that only trained airmen who truly understood this new weapon should be allowed to command it. Thus, an independent air force must be created separate from stultifying army and navy control, and should consist primarily of self-defending bombardment aircraft.  When discussing the vital centers of a country, Douhet believed that the psychological effects of bombardment would be more pronounced than the physical effects. As a consequence, he called for the use of incendiary and gas bombs—and recall that poison gas had been used extensively in World War I—against a country’s major population cen- ters. He believed that attacks of this sort would cause such panic that the population would demand an end to the war. Douhet speculated that this would occur before a lengthy and bloody ground battle took place. He never called for the abolition of the army and navy, but obviously he believed that in the unified defense establishment he proposed, the air  472 x THE JOURNAL OF  Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

As a result, he saw little need for aircraft specifically designed to assist the ground or sea battle.  The criticisms of Douhet’s theories are legion. He grossly overesti- mated both the physical and psychological effects of bombing. Popula- tions did not break as quickly as he thought they would under the weight of air att
