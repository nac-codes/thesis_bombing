Phillips, “Preview of Armageddon,” Saturday Evening Post, 12 March 1938, pp. 12-13, 95-100. Two excellent discussions of Douhet’s ideas and influence are Edward Warner, “Douhet, Mitchell, Sev- ersky: Theories of Air Warfare,” in Edward Mead Earle, ed., Makers of Modern Strategy: Military Thought from Machiavelli to Hitler (Prince- ton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1944); and David Maclsaac, “Voices from the Central Blue: The Air Theorists,” in Peter Paret, ed., Makers of Modern Strategy: From Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1986).

Stephens is particularly valuable because he discusses the differences and similarities between the ideas of Douhet and those of his contemporaries in Britain and the United States.  William “Billy” Mitchell  Billy Mitchell was the leading American air theorist prior to World War II. He was the senior U.S. air commander in World War I, and upon returning home in 1919 became the Air Service’s chief of operations and training. Mitchell was extremely prolific: he published three major books on aviation, as well as dozens of articles. His first book, Our Air Force: The Key to National Defense (New York: Dutton, 1921), was written shortly a
