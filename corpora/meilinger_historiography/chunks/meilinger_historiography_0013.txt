He states here that aircraft, although generally complementing surface operations, can at times dominate them. He is especially critical of the capability of naval vessels to defend themselves from air attack, and at this stage he has a positive opinion of aircraft car-  474 x THE JOURNAL OF  Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Later, he would totally reject the viability of carriers, perhaps because he saw them as a threat to his goal of unifying all air assets under a single separate service. Mitchell also noted the utility of strategic bombing to disrupt and possi- bly destroy a large portion of an enemy’s war-making capability.

Hurley’s Billy Mitchell: Crusader for Air Power (New York: Franklin Watts, 1964) is the best treatment of Mitchell’s theories on air- power.

The best short treatment is Lieu- tenant Colonel Mark A. Clodfelter, “Molding Airpower Convictions: Development and Legacy of William Mitchell’s Strategic Thought,” in Paths of Heaven.
