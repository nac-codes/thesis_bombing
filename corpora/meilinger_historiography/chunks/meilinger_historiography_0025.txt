Service Aviation,” Army Quarterly 2 (April 1921): 10-21, he lays out some of the basic ideas noted above. In addi- tion, perhaps out of a bureaucratic imperative, he called for an air force in being that was large and modern enough to fight at the immediate out- set of hostilities. The speed of aircraft and their ability to strike virtually anywhere at the outset of war had made leisurely mobilization a thing of the past.

It was espe- cially significant to realize that the RAF’s victory in the Battle of Britain had saved the country. Could airpower defeat Germany? Trenchard stated simply: “I do not know. I have never claimed that we can. Equally, I have never suggested that we cannot.” He went on to argue that Ger- man industry was slowly but surely being destroyed, “which will in time render them powerless to supply their armies and Air Force in the field to carry on the war.” Trenchard called for a greater effort to accomplish such destruction more quickly. In the two other essays contained in this same book, Air Power: Three Papers (London: Air Ministry, 1946) and written after German defeat, Trenchard merely recapitulates the key
