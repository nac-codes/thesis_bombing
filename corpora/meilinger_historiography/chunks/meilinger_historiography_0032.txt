recognized that strategic bombing was only tangentially related to the goals of the expeditionary force. Instead, there was a real need to isolate the battle- field with airpower—to disrupt and destroy the enemy’s lines of supply. This mission, today called interdiction, would entail the targeting of communications and transportation nodes, fuel depots, supply and ammunition centers, and enemy field headquarters. Even so, he cau- tioned that the first priority, as always, remained the necessity of gain- ing air superiority. Without it, ground operations would be nearly impossible. Significantly, Slessor also discussed command relationships, and insisted that air and ground commanders should be equal. They should plan their operations together, and then work together to imple- ment those plans, but they should not be subordinate to each other.  Upon leaving Camberley for an assignment in India, Slessor col- lected his Staff College lectures and published them as Air Power and Armies (London: Oxford University Press, 1936). This classic work is perhaps the most thoughtful, measured, and articulate treatise on air- power written to that time. His emphasis on targeting lines of supply was reflected in the Allied “transportation plan” that was so instrumental in disrupting German ground operations before and after D-day.
