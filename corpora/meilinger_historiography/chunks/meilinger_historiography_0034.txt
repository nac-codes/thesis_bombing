1936). Golovine, like many airmen, was a technological determinist, who believed airpower was the epitome of advanced technology. He especially advocated the importance of speed, seeing it as the guarantor of surprise, but also seeing it as a possible antidote to air defenses. In his respect for air defenses, both ground based and airborne, he was unusual. Golovine saw a growing accuracy and effectiveness for aircraft detection systems—he even predicted the development of infrared sensors to detect aircraft at night—as well as antiaircraft artillery. Also, unlike Douhet or Trenchard, he anticipated an air battle, one that meant a need for escort fighters to accompany the bombers.  486 «x THE JOURNAL OF  Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

The best short treatment of this subject for the U.S. Navy is David R. Mets, “The Influence of Aviation on the Evolution of American Naval Thought,” in Paths of Heaven. For more detailed treatments, see Clark G. Reynolds, The Fast Carriers: The Forging of an Air Navy (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1968), and George W. Baer, One Hundred Years of Sea Power: The U.S. Navy, 1890-1990 (Stanford, Calif.:; Stanford University Press, 1994). Both of these are excellent studies and clearly discuss the doctrinal, organizational, technical, and administrative challenges facing the U.S. Navy during the interwar years. Due to the foresight of some exceptional individuals, however, the Navy was able to build an aircraft carrier fleet second to none. Although the doctrine necessary to effectively employ these carriers as powerful, independent strike forces had not been codi- fied at the time of Pearl Harbor, the ground work had been expertly a
