re the costly struggle for air superiority over Germany,  MILITARY HISTORY * 487  Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.  File: --- meilinger_historiography.pdf --- Page 22 --- PHILLIP S$. MEILINGER : = SEE:  Victory is a stark book. Seversky denigrates all suggestions of defeating Germany and Japan by relying on land and sea power—these were out- moded forms of war. Instead, long-range airpower, based preferably on American territory, would pummel the Axis powers into submission at far less cost than a land campaign, and far more quickly than a sea cam- paign. Although filled with hyperbole and questionable logic, Victory enjoyed tremendous popularity and helped shape American public opin- ion on the employment of airpower.  Good contemporary critiques of Seversky include David Brown, “Victory Through Hot Air Power,” Pic, 5 January 1943, pp. 7-9; Hoffman Nickerson, “Seversky: ‘Air Power!’ Nickerson: ‘Not Enough!” Field Artillery Journal 32 (July 1942): 543-49; and Cy Caldwell, Air Power and Total War (New York: Coward-McCann, 1943). The best recent analysis of Seversky’s works is Phillip S. Meilinger, “Alexander P. DeSev- ersky and American Airpower,” in Paths of Heaven. In addition, an unpublished master’s thesis gives important background information and insights: Russell E. Lee, “Victory Through Air Power: American Army Air Forces, Navy, and Public Reaction to the Book and Film During World War II,” George Mason University, 1992.  World War II brought a spate of books on the use of the new weapon. One of the first was by Major Al Williams, Air Power (New York: Coward- McCann, 1940), which recounts the conflicts in Ethiopia, Spain, and the opening events of World War II. An “America First” supporter and oppo- nent of President Roosevelt, he argued that America was woefully unpre- pared for war, especially in the air. This was especially serious because the air had become the decisive theater of war.
