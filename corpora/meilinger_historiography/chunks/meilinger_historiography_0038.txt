us books were published in the decade after World War II espous- ing the thesis that war had forever changed, and that airpower—specifi- eally aircraft delivering nuclear weapons—now dominated war. It seemed a safe prediction. Even the Korean War did little to shake the faith in nuclear airpower. Korea was viewed, by all the services, as an aberration. It is well to remember that the American policy of “massive retaliation” was promulgated after the Korean War, and it was advanced by General Dwight Eisenhower—now President—and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Arthur Radford. The hope, and one that Giulio Douhet would have understood, was that airpower—in the hands of the West—would keep the peace through its deterrent value. The con- cept of airpower “so horrible it was humanizing” had returned.  Special mention should be made here of a book that seems to deal only tangentially with our subject. Steven T. Ross, American War Plans, 1945-1950 (New York: Garland, 1988), is a vital source because it is the most complete study to date of the American war plans devised in the decade following World War IJ. These war plans relied primarily on nuclear weapons delivered by air; hence, their relationship to this essay. Beginning soon after the war, military planners began to consider a future war against their erstwhile ally, the Soviet Union. The problems con- fronting these planners seemed enormous: American military forces had virtually disintegrated in the aftermath of VJ-day; the Soviets maintained a huge military structure; Eastern Europe was dominated if not occupied by Soviet troops; Western Europe—our logical ally—was prostrate; and China was teetering and would eventually fall to communism. Given this nightmarish scenario, planners inevitably turned towards a reliance on nuclear weapons; they would be, they would have to be, the equalizer in a confrontation with Soviet and Chinese mass. Ross painstakingly goes through the series of plans and their
