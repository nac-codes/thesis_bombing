“prime” campaign for air superiority, the “separate” campaign of strategic bombardment, and the “force multi- plier” campaign of air cooperation with surface forces.

That attribute should not be wasted on targets that can be handled by other means, such as artillery or armored forces. He views land forces as becoming more supportive of air operations, rather tha
