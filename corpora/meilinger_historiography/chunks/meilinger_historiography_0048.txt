most intelligent, rigorous, and creative airpower thinkers we have today. In Air Power: A Centennial Appraisal (London: Brassey’s, 1995), Mason covers a wide area. Indeed, it is not, as the title suggests, either an overall treatment of airpower in all of its various roles world- wide, nor is it an assessment of how well airpower has performed in war. Instead, it is a somewhat disparate collection of essays that, although excellent, have no centralizing theme. Nonetheless, there are true gems here; my favorites are the chapters on arms control in the 1980s, and the concluding chapter titled “The Era of Differential Airpower,” which is a look to the future of airpower in the post-Cold War era.  A colleague and countryman of Mason, Air Commodore Andrew G. B. Vallance, wrote an overview of air warfare titled The Air Weapon: Doc- trines of Air Power Strategy and Operational Art (London: Macmillan,  494 * THE JOURNAL OF  Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Vallance, like Mason, had been the RAF’s Director of Defence Studies. In that position his charter was to think about airpower theory and doctrine, help to evolve it, and then to disseminate it so as to teach his service. This book is the culmination of those efforts. Vallance states boldly that airpower today dominates military operations and that dom- inance is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Yet, paradoxically, most airmen—to say nothing of the other services and the public—do not adequately understand what airpower can do and what it cannot do. Vallance has therefore written a primer that discusses the fundamental characteristics of airpower, and then explains in detail its various roles and missions such as air superiority, antisurface attack, strategic attack, and air transport. The strength of this presentation lies more
