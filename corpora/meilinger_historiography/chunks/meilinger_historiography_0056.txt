volumes in this series—if we may call it that—include Group Captain Andrew Vallance, ed., Air Power: Collected Essays on Doctrine (London: HMSO, 1990); three excellent compendiums edited by Alan Stephens, the head of the RAAF’s Air Power Studies Centre, Smaller but Larger: Conventional Air Power into the 21st Century (Canberra: Air Power Studies Centre, 1991), Defending the Air/Sea Gap (Canberra: Australian Defence Studies Cen- tre, 1992); and New Era Security: The RAAF in the Next Twenty-Five Years (Canberra: Air Power Studies Centre, 1994). The work done by the Australians under the enlightened guidance of Stephens has been most impressive. Every one of these volumes contains several thought- provoking essays that look at airpower in a unique and interesting way. Another work in the RAF group is Group Captain Andrew Lambert and Arthur Williamson, eds., The Dynamics of Air Power (London: HMSO, 1996). This volume has some particularly interesting and useful essays on airpower and coercion by Michael Clarke, the role of the media in air operations by Wing Commander Mike Bratby, and several pieces that deal with airpower in peace enforcement operations.  The most recent of these collections published by the RAF is Group Captain Stuart Peach, ed., Perspectives on Air Power (London: HMSO, 1998). This book has an interesting thread that runs throughout. War- fare is becoming increasingly joint due not only to organizational imper- atives, but because airpower has permeated all the services to such a great extent. In the U.S., for example, the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps all have air arms that are among the largest and most capable in the world. At the same time, however, the Navy has their own land force of marines, the Army has its own fleet of supply ships, and all of the ser- vices rely heavily on space assets. In addition, a key issue that has sep- arated airmen from their surface brethren over the decades has been the strategic versus tactical air debate. Over the
