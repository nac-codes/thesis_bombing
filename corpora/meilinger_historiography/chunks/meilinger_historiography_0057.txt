e ser- vices rely heavily on space assets. In addition, a key issue that has sep- arated airmen from their surface brethren over the decades has been the strategic versus tactical air debate. Over the past decade, however, the surface forces have become far more interested in the “deep battle’—an area where they could not reach before, and so they found it unimpor- tant. As the surface forces have steadily encroached on what had been “air territory,” airmen themselves have turned towards targeting strate- gies that have focused on command and control networks, fielded forces, and leadership nodes. In short, the views of all the services are beginning to focus on the same area, thus facilitating a more comprehensive and complementary approach to warfighting.  Other anthologies include Tony Mason, ed., War in the Third Dimension: Essays in Contemporary Air Power (London: Brassey’s,  MILITARY HISTORY x 499  Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.  File: --- meilinger_historiography.pdf --- Page 34 --- PHILLIP S. MEILINGER — —e es —— =  1986). This is an excellent collection with truly outstanding essays by Mason himself on the air superiority campaign, David Maclsaac on the evolution of American air doctrine after World War II, air war in Vietnam by Alan Gropman, and Soviet air doctrine and practice by Ben Lambeth. Another outstanding effort is Richard P. Hallion, ed., Air Power Con- fronts an Unstable World (London: Brassey’s, 1997). Hallion, himself an excellent historian as well as being the U.S. Air Force Historian, has assembled a worthy stable of airpower thinkers and writers. There are some truly seminal essays here by Barry D. Watts on technology, Group Captain Andrew Lambert on the psychological effects of air attack, Rear Admiral James A. Winnefeld on joint air operations, Hallion himself on the importance of the revolution in precision weapons, Colonel Phil Meilinger on air targeting strategies,
