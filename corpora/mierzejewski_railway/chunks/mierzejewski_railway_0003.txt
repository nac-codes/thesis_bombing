How this happened, and how the Allies came to conduct this devastating campaign is portrayed in detail. Until recently the economic history of the Third Reich has been comparatively neglected. Among the works that have appeared during the last few years none has focused on the operation of the German economy during World War II.1 Moreover, only one study deals with the Deutsche Reichsbahn.2 At the same time, there is a dearth of serious works that examine the impact of strategic bomb- ing on the Nazi economy. Most focus on the struggle for air supremacy which was only a preliminary to the actual offensive. No attempt will be made to list the superfluity of works on the subject.2 The ultimate purpose of the strategic bombing offensive was to weaken or destroy Germanyâ€™s war machine: its administrative apparatus, its industry, and its military forces. Only a few studies have examined this aspect of the air war though none recently and none using the full range of German, American, and British archival sources. Most notable are the British and American official histories and the reports of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey.4 A few other works have examined the fate of certain industries under the bombing.5 To help fill this gap, new documentary sources obtained in German, American, and British archives are used in this book, combined with a fresh perspective from one who has no institutional ties past or present to any of the actors.
