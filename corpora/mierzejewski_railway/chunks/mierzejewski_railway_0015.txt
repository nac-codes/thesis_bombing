they would be rewarded with success for German arms during the coming year. The second period began in September 1936. In response to a foreign exchange shortage and the opposition of the minister of economics, Hjalmar Schacht, Hitler modified his economic policy by enunciating the second Four Year Plan under Hermann GGring. He called upon industry to make Germany ready for war within four years. To this end the government would sponsor the expansion of the synthetic fuel industry and promote the greater use of low-grade domestic iron ore. For some years the Air Ministry, moving independently, had been expanding the capacity of the aviation industry.2  Due to the technical immaturity of the hydrogénation and Fischer-Tropsch processes and shortages of certain components made from steel, synthetic fuel production lagged badly behind expect- ations.4 Resistance by heavy industry centered in the Ruhr stymied progress in exploiting domestic iron ore. In response, the government sharpened its intervention in economic affairs. On 15 July 1937 Goring decreed the formation of the gigantic Reichswerke Hermann Goring AG (RWHG), using forced loans and drafts of engineers from existing iron and steel companies to create a management staff overnight.4 The complex would exploit the low-quality iron ores located near Salzgitter in central Germany. Named to lead the new combine was Paul Pleiger, an energetic manager cum techno- crat from the Ruhr and a member of the Nazi Party.2  A further acceleration of rearmament followed in 1938. Production of most armaments had risen but nevertheless failed to meet Hitler’s ambitious demands, primarily due to the inefficiency of G6ring’s organization.’ The synthetic fuel program had yet to yield appreciable results and the RWHG was still almost two years away from smelting its first ton of iron.2 Schacht resigned as minister of economics and plenipotentiary for the war economy in November 1937. He was replaced by the political nonentity Walthe
