n had fallen from 78 percent of the GNP in 1933 to 52 percent in 1938.12 Armaments spending rose from 4 to 22 percent of GNP which itself had risen by 16 percent compared to 1928.13 A significant increase in the size in arms spending had occurred, but the economy had not been prepared for “total war” on the model of the First World War.14 Twenty-nine percent of total industrial output still served consumer needs.15 The increase in military strength had been won primarily by exploiting capacity idled by the Great Depression, and by concentrating on producing finished armaments. It was complemented by a hurried effort: to build new capital facilities that would render Germany temporarily less dependent on imports of militarily important raw materials in selected industries and would be located in areas less vulnerable to air attack.16 The largest prewar increase in the share of national income devoted to the military buildup occurred only in 1938 and 1939, too late to create significant reserves of armaments.1Z The basic structure of German industry was not altered.18 Advanced production methods were not employed and the demands made on both capital and labor, with a few critical exceptions, were modest compared to Hitler’s ambitions.  The Reich’s economic preparations for war bore the imprint of Nazi ideology and the corrosive internal bureaucratic competition fostered by Hitler. Five groups emerged hoping to shape Germany’s economic destiny. One, the weakest, was centered in the Nazi Party. It sought to restructure German society on corporatist lines deemphasizing urbanization and industrialization. But it was aban- doned early by Hitler since it opposed his rearmament goals and the concomitant alliance with industry.12 However it did not disappear. It simply bided its time secure in its own power base in the Party’s regional Gau structure.  A second group, the military was weakened by internal divisions. Each branch of the three services had its own weapons procure
