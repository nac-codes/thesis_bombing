5 The concomitant was the denigration of bureaucratic organization and the discounting of the role of the state.26 From this flowed an irrational conception of social mobilization as a fanatical burst of national emotional energy. Hitler visualized it as an imperialist war that would either conquer the territory needed for Germany’s survival or lead to the Volk’s utter ruin.22 Economic reality would be compelled to serve the adventure by the force of indomitable will.28 Hitler expressed the latter idea when he asserted that, “The state orders and the economy meets the requirements of the state.”22 The state, in this formulation, was seen as the tool of the Nazi Party.

Concepts of mobile warfare stressing speed and the innovative use of combined arms were developed by others and were adopted by the Nazis. Hitler applied them to his imperialist dreams by conceiving of a series of short, sharp wars of territorial conquest culminating in the final titanic confrontation with the Soviet Union.22 At the outset, the economy would generate only the military power necessary to defeat Germany’s initial opponents, who would be weak and isolated. The preliminary conquests would not only clear Germany’s strategic rear but also enhance its economic position.32  No formal statement was drawn up outlining this design. But each of its components—mobile warfare, conquest of territory, and economic stimulation—had long been topics of public discussion in Germany Hitler himself spoke so often on these subjects that there can be no doubt t
