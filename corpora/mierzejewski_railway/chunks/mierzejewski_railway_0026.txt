ted that would provide for increased use of synthetics, the exchange of simple for complicated components, and savings in raw material consumption. It ordered an increase in coal and oil production but gave responsibility for achieving it to the Four Year Plan Office, which had been trying to do just that for six years. Field Marshal Keitel, chief of OKW, was empowered to resolve disputes arising among the services. But the heads of the three branches of the armed forces were left responsible for the direction of their own programs.4! Allocation of labor among industries was to be done by Keitel and Todt. No mention was made of reducing civilian production. No changes were made in the organizational structure. It has become a commonplace to view the Fithrer Order Riistung 1942 as a turning point in the economic affairs of the Third Reich.42 But the text of the order provides no clue as to why it should have triggered a major change. Certainly it called for increased arms production and concentration both in terms of resource allocation and production effort. But that had been done before. In fact the order represented a continuation of the existing system at a higher level of intensity. While important, it presaged no fundamental change in policy. It has gained importance only because it has been associated with events that followed and were only incidentally related to it. On 8 February 1942, under circumstances that have not been fully clarified, Todt died in an airplane crash while leaving Hitler’s headquarters at Rastenburg.43 Viewed solely in relation to the performance of preceding years, Todt’s stewardship of the German economy during 1940 and 1941 was creditable. He did increase overall production. Where it fell, the cause was lack of demand by the military. Yet when set against the vast military tasks and the impending avalanche of materiel from Allied factories facing Germany, it was utterly inadequate. For years Thomas had warned Hit-1er of the stakes.44
