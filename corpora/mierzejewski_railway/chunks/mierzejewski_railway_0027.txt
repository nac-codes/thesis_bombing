when set against the vast military tasks and the impending avalanche of materiel from Allied factories facing Germany, it was utterly inadequate. For years Thomas had warned Hit-1er of the stakes.44 Todt had himself counselled peace negotations. But the Fiihrer was working with another, unrealistic set of premises. Todt cannot be held responsible for the failure to change basic policy.
