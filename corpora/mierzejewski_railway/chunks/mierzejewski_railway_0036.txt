rafted orders embodying its decisions, and monitored production programs. The committees and rings were subordinated 1:0 it. Kehrl took personal charge of one of the officeâ€™s subsections, the Raw Materials Office. The vital basis for planning that had been lacking had finally been created. For the first time, rather than functioning as a referee, Central Planning was able to look into the future and take initiatives based on a sound empirical foundation. Speer and the Planning Office now had control of all forms of armaments production except aircraft, which he heavily influenced, a considerable share of consumer goods output, and all raw materials production. But the Planning Office was not omnipotent. It was not given responsibility for iron production, resulting in competition with the Armaments Supply Office under Walther Schieber. In addition it possessed no authority in the field of labor.64 Here Sauckel had strengthened his position. Considerable room for mischief remained because the armaments offices of the armed services still prepared production plans based on the alleged needs of their branches. These were submitted to the Planning Office, coordinated with other schemes and raw material supplies, and laid before Central Planning for approval.  Overall, the system had been greatly improved. Many abuses of the pre-February 1942 era had been eliminated. Kehrl had become one of the most powerful administrators in Germany. But the very size of the organization led to frictions within and conflicts outside. The first period of the Speer regime had resulted in substantial gains, but the task remained far from completed.  The framework of the armaments bureaucracy had assumed its definitive shape with one crucial exception, aviation. That would be absorbed not as the result of bureaucratic competition but in response to an air-raid emergency. It marked the first weakening of the system. The initial economic emergency caused by an air raid occurred in the summer
