The Fighter Staff phenomenon recurred. Geilenberg ignored all other needs and ruthlessly requisitioned materials for his repair and con- crete-shelter programs. Miracles were performed, but oil output plummeted under repeated bombings and the fragile system of economic control was further disrupted.  The period after February 1942 had witnessed substantial progress. True centralization of planning and control, with the important exception of labor affairs, had been accomplished.
