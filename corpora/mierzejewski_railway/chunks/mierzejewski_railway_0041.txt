Saur on I March 1944. Speer and Milch had not desired Saur’s appointment, but Hitler, acting on impulse, named him during a discussion at his headquarters.&2 He immediately set to A third armaments emergency exploded in May 1944 as a consequence of a series of very heavy strikes by the Eighth Air Force on synthetic fuel plants in central Germany.2° Speer again met the complexity of the issues, Saur promised rapid and spectacular results in answer to the Fiihrer’s unrealistic demands. The upshot was that Hitler, rather than face the contingent responses and veiled criticisms expressed by Speer during the summer, increasingly turned to Saur to resolve economic and armaments problems. Just as Speer had completed construction of his economic machine it was beset by new enemies from without and began to disintegrate from within. Despite the energy dissipated in internal political disputes, arms output rose dramatically. The overall index of armaments production, taking January/February 1942 as 100, had risen in two distinct leaps (see Figure 1.1).74 The first increase lasted from February 1942 until May 1943, jumping from 97 to 232, and averaging 5.5 percent per month. Bearing in mind that a 5 percent annual growth rate for an economy is considered good, such a sustained performance must be judged outstanding. There followed a second period during which growth hovered at 0.9 percent per month stretching from June 1943 to February 1944. The armaments index rose during this span only from 226 to 231. Then a second armaments boom began featuring a spectacular 17 percent spurt in March 1944. Overall, then, Speer and the German economy had registered a striking production success. Precisely how this was realized is surprising. Between Speer’s assumption of his duties and the apogee of armaments production in mid-1944, Germany’s gross national product had risen by only about 6 percent.
