His leadership of the Fighter Staff and its apparent production successes vastly output increased by only about 5 percent.25 Production of raw materials rose by just 7 percent.26 Moreover, civilian consumer goods output had not been drastically curtailed until after Speer wrested control of the raw materials and consumer goods industries from the Economics Ministry in September 1943.72 So even under Speer there was no major restructuring of the German economy. In- creases in armaments output had been won with other more subtle methods. One means used by Speer was the reallocation of resources within industry. Changes in the distribution of labor provide an insight into this. The overall size of the labor force hardly changed throughout the war.78 But employment in armaments factories increased by 30.7 percent between 30 June 1941 and 31 March 1944.72 Measured in terms of value of output, the share of armaments final production in overall industrial output rose from 19 percent in 1941 to approximately 50 percent in 1944.89 But neither the increase in GNP nor the transfer of factors of production to military purposes was sufficient to propel the massive and sustained
