The secret of Speer’s success lay in a myriad of individual efficiencies that together permitted massive savings of all factors of production. A clue appears in the “Newsletter of the Reich Minister for Armaments and War Production” of 9 June 1944.81 A metal hammering works is discussed at which in the year between 1 April 1943 and 31 March 1944 production had risen by 85 percent while coal  consumption had sunk by 41 percent. Energy consumption per ton of finished steel had fallen 40 percent. This development was typica to unit of finished output, measured by weight, had fallen dramatically from 4:1 to 2:1.82 Labor productivity had also risen. In the meta!  . Between 1941 and 1944 the ratio of unit of raw material input working industries, value added by each worker per ton of raw  material had climbed during Speer’s tenure by 18 percent.83 Labor productivity in final production of all types of goods rose by a third.84 Most importantly, labor productivity in the crucial armaments  sector improved spectacularly (see Table I.1)  Clearly Speer’s efforts using young engineers gathered in the committees and rings had borne fruit. Best methods had
