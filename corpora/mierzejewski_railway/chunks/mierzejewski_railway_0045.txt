Best methods had been propagated throughout industry, the multiplicity of models and variants  reduced, and management initiative encouraged by industrial self-responsibility.8° The result was a major increase in the production o The examples in Table 1.2 suffice to illustrate the astonishing jump in armaments output.

These increases were the consequence of Speer’s shrewd recognition that t with the prevailing ideological climate prevented him from embarking on a program of major capital expansion and restructuring. Ex  e decisions so haphazardly made during the 1930s combined pedients and managerial palliatives were his only alternatives.  9% consumption had sunk by 41 percent. Energy consumption per ton of finished steel had fallen 40 percent. This development was typical. Between 1941 and 1944 the ratio of unit of raw material input to unit of finished output, measured by weight, had fallen dramatically from 4:1 to 2:1.82 Labor productivity had also risen. In the metal working industries, value added by each worker per ton of raw reduced, and management initiative encouraged by industrial self-responsibility.82 The result was a major increase in the production of those weapons most needed by the military. The examples in Table 1.2 suffice to illustrate the astonishing jump in armaments output. While substantial gains were made in 1940 and 1941 as a result of Todt’s reforms, the really
