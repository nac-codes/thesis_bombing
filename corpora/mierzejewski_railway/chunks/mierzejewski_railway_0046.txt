by the military. The examples in Table 1.2 suffice to illustrate the astonishing jump in armaments output. While substantial gains were made in 1940 and 1941 as a result of Todt’s reforms, the really significant increases were the product of Speer’s centralization measures of 1942 and 1943. They alone permitted the gains in efficiency that enabled him to maintain the German people’s standard of living and simultaneously vastly to increase armaments production. These increases were the consequence of Speer’s shrewd recognition that the decisions so haphazardly made during the 1930s combined with the prevailing ideological climate prevented him from embarking on a program of major capital expansion and restructuring. Expedients and managerial palliatives were his only alternatives. The creation of the Planning Office was decisive because it ensured that they retained coherence and direction. No central authority however powerful, can function without mastering the flow of in- formation. That was the Planning Office’s contribution. It made possible the gains in efficiency and their mass exploitation.8& Table 1.1 Index of Labor Productivity in the Armaments Industry 1941-1944 1941/42 1942/43 1943/44 June—July 1944 Page 18 of 282 9% Source: Wagenfiihr, Deutsche Industrie, pp. 66, 114, 178. sector improved spectacularly (see Table I.) reduced, and management initiative encouraged by industrial self-responsibility.85 The result was a major increase in the production of those weapons most needed by the military. 1941/42 1942/43 1943/44 June-July 1944 234  Source: Wagenfiihr, Deutsche Industrie, p. 125.
