Trading patterns and regional specialization had developed according to functional and geographical factors resulting in a division of labor that enabled the aggregate to produce more than the mere sum of its parts could have produced independently. The decisive factor was an industry’s relationship to the nation’s preponderant source of energy—coal. All German industry revolved around one Coal was Germany’s only abundant natural resource. From the beginning of the period of its industrialization, German industry had intensively exploited its coal resources to offset its lack of other raw materials and grouped itself around its coal storehouses to cut costs. The first such relationship bloomed in the Ruhr. The pattern repeated itself elsewhere using different technologies and resulting in different trading relationships to create the division of labor as it existed in 1933. By the eve of World War II, the German economy derived over 90 percent of its energy from one form or another of coal.2 The smelting of everv kilogram of iron required the consumption of almost twice its weight in coal. Six tons of coal stood behind everv ton of synthetic gasoline.
