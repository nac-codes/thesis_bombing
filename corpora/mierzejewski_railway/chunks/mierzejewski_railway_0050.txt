The industry mechanically shaped these ranks to fit the furnaces of their customers, thus offering optimum thermal qualities and reduced residues.£ These were marketed by coal traders as types. The critical consideration is that coal was not a uniform product. The many geological varieties and market-oriented permutations handled by German coal traders resulted in a highly complex industry that experienced all of the inventory and utilization problems that one ordinarily assocates with finer commodities. Coals were not easily interchange- able for all of their visual resemblance.  To facilitate its utilization, a number of derivative forms of coal were developed.Z The most important was coke. A hard, brittle, spongy mass, coke was first used in the Ruhr in the late 1850s. It is devoid of coal’s gaseous constituents and is used to line smelters to enable a more uniform and malleable iron to be produced.8 Coke triggered the boom in Germany’s iron industry that caused iron works to congregate in the Ruhr to obtain coke as cheaply as poss wake  . Other heavy industrial and ancillary industries followed in their ly af ry .2 Coal was at once the indispensable basis of the German economy and the life blood of its Ruhr hard coal had energy values ranging from 6,800 to 7,600 calories per kilogram. Upper Silesian hard coals were slightly less potent. Within this broad grouping were ranks, each with its own To facilitate its utilization, a number of derivative forms of coal were developed.? The most important was coke. A hard, brittle, spongy mass, coke was first used in the Ruhr in the late 1850s. It is wake.  In the coal economy year 1943/44, Germany produced 278.1 million tons of hard coal and 53.3 million tons of coke.2 Her total assured reserves amounted to 190.6 billion tons.1° These massive stores were scattered about at six locations. But only three were economically significant and of these two were of overwhelming importance.  Holding a third of Germany’s proven res
