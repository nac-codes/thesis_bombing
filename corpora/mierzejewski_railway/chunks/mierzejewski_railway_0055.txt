and water to build a balanced, redundant, generating system. Hard coal was burned to generate almost half of Germany’s electricity brown coal generated a third, and hydro plants provided a fifth.23 Large publicly owned facilities were situated near the brown coal fields providing the system’s basic capacity. Smaller hard coal plants were located adjacent to large cities and industries when it was deemed more economical to ship hard coal than build and operate transmission lines. Hydroelectric plants were built in southern Germany and Austria to take advantage of fast-flowing rivers. A few others were placed near reservoirs elsewhere. Together they were used as giant storage batteries to meet peak loads.24 Total generating capacity in early 1944 was 13.3 million kilowatts of which 9.7 million were actually available for use. The difference between capacity and availability was caused by plants shut down for scheduled maintenance and other technical limitations.25 Total production in 1943 was just over 47 billion kilowatt-hours.26 It was allocated by the Reich Load Distributor (Reichslast Verteiler, RLV), Dr. Richard Fischer, who was also head of Berlin’s public utility.22 Fischer controlled a unified system consisting of the publicly owned plants, which contributed just over half of all electricity generated, and private plants, most of which were associated with heavy industry.28 Virtually every producer was tied into the national grid that, within certain limitations, allowed the exchange of supplies among regions.22 By far the heaviest consumer of electricity was industry which used almost nine-tenths of all that was generated.22 The branches with the biggest appetites were electrochemicals and electrometallurgy, which together consumed almost half of total production. Trailing far behind were mining and heavy industry.24 Gas performed a function similar to electricity. But its dependence on hard coal was far greater. It was produced in three basic forms32 and ge
