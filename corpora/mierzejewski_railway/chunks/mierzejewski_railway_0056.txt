n. Trailing far behind were mining and heavy industry.24 Gas performed a function similar to electricity. But its dependence on hard coal was far greater. It was produced in three basic forms32 and generally had a heat value of 4,300 calories per cubic meter.33 It was generated by two industry groups: municipal works and cokeries where it was obtained as a by-product. Total production in 1943 was a bit over twenty-nine billion cubic meters. The cokeries were the most important, providing over four-fifths of the total.34 All producers were united in a long-distance grid. The biggest consumer from the grid in the Ruhr area, for example, was heavy industry which took two-thirds of available supplies.35 Iron and chemical industries in the same area consumed three-quarters of the cokery gas produced there.36 The cokeries were located near their coal supplies. But the municipal works relied on transport, mostly rail, for their coal. Their consumption was enormous.
