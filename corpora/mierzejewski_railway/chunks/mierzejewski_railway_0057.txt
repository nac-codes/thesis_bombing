5 Iron and chemical industries in the same area consumed three-quarters of the cokery gas produced there.36 The cokeries were located near tons and 76,736 tons of hard coal per month during early 1944.32 Stocks varied. In regions near the coal producing areas they were kept low, on the order of enough for a few days, while at more distant places such as Frankfurt/Main or Stuttgart, there might be as much as for two weeks.28 Allocation of gas supplies to consumers and fuel to the plants was in the hands of the Economic Group Gas and Water Utilities and the RVK under the constant oversight of the Planning Office.  Neither electricity nor gas was plentiful, although neither was so short as to curtail production seriously. Economies were enforced and plans were on the shelf to enable further savings if necessary.22 plants generating electricity could be built beside the mines, using conveyor belts to bring the raw coal to the furnaces.22 Synthetic fuel plants were located near brown coal pits for the same reason. The branches with the biggest appetites were electrochemicals and electrometallurgy, which together consumed almost half of total production. Trailing far behind were mining and heavy industry.31 Gas performed a function similar to electricity. But its dependence on hard coal was far greater. It was produced in three basic forms?2 and generally had a heat value of 4,300 calories per cubic meter.23 It was generated by two industry groups: municipal works and cokeries where it was obtained as a by-product. Total production in 1943 was a bit over twenty-nine billion cubic meters. The cokeries were the most important, providing over four-fifths of the total.34 All producers were united in a long-distance grid. The biggest consumer from the grid in the Ruhr area, for example, was tons and 76,736 tons of hard coal per month during early 1944.37 Stocks varied. In regions near the coal producing areas they were kept low, on the order of enough for a few days, while at
