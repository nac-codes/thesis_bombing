ample, was tons and 76,736 tons of hard coal per month during early 1944.37 Stocks varied. In regions near the coal producing areas they were kept low, on the order of enough for a few days, while at more distant necessary.32  These were the chief coal users when considered in aggregate. Individual branches within industry consumed less, giving a deceptively low indication of their importance. It must be remembered when considering their coal consumption figures that industries were simultaneously using gas and electricity and that the fabrication of subassemblies, while not requiring high direct energy use, was nevertheless an indispensable part of the industrial system. For example, the munitions industry used only about seven-tenths of 1 percent of total coal production. Synthetic fuels used less than a tenth.42 In contrast the iron sector used well over a fifth.41 The critical consideration is that coal played a decisive role at every level of the production process, and because that process was highly in- tegrated, the functioning of each component depended upon the smooth operation of every other.  The image of a complex system of mutually dependent parts was very difficult for those involved in it to bear in mind. Consequently Paul Pleiger and the Reich Coal Association constantly worked to ensure that competition for energy did not hinder the functioning of the whole. In 1941 Pleiger established a set of priorities for coal distribution that put transportation at the top along with armaments plants, utilities, cokeries, and the military. A year later, he imposed a limit on coal stocks of two to three months, depending on how it was shipped, in order to prevent hoarding. But the guidelines were vague and not rigorously enforced. Companies relied instead upon established business connections, sometimes involving shipments from distant suppliers, to obtain coal in excess of the stipulations. Pleiger attempted to curb this in April 1941 by dividing Germany into
