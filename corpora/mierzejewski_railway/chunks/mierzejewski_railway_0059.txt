blished business connections, sometimes involving shipments from distant suppliers, to obtain coal in excess of the stipulations. Pleiger attempted to curb this in April 1941 by dividing Germany into two large areas to be served by the two leading hard coal regions.42 The country was split along an imaginary line running from Rostock on the Baltic to Stendahl, Magdeburg, Aschersleben, Weimar, Probstzella to the Bavarian border. East of it, industries would turn to Upper Silesia. To the west and in Bavaria, they were in the hands of one of Pleiger’s nominal subordinates, the mighty Rhenish-Westphalian Coal Syndicate (RheinischWestfalisches Kohlen-Syndikat, RWKS).  The RWKS was formed in 1893 to protect the Ruhr coal mine owners from competition by pooling resources and limiting production to maintain prices.43 The syndicate determined virtually every phase of its members’ operations and enjoyed unlimited oversight powers.44 Over the years it drove out or absorbed all competition in the area and established regional representatives throughout western, central, and southern Germany, the Syndicate Trading Companies (Syndikatshandelsgesellschaften, SHGs), to deal with customers. By the mid-1920s, it controlled three-quarters of Ger- many’s hard coal production. Its dominance was reinforced in 1934 and 1935 when the Aachen and Saar mines were put under its sway by the RWM.45 The acquisition of the Polish sections of Silesia by the eastern region did not fundamentally weaken its position. The RWKS still controlled the nation’s primary source of coke and, although the eastern region had its own industry organization, the Upper Silesian Hard Coal Syndicate (Oberschlesisches SteinkohlenSyndikat, OSS), the RWKS was incomparably better organized and enjoyed more important political connections in Berlin. Its chairman, Riidiger Schmidt, was therefore one of the most powerful, if least known, business leaders in Germany.46 When he saw fit, he could balk government policy. So long
