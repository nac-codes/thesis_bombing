But when he intervened, as he began to do more often during the early part of 1944, Schmidt resisted. Like the leaders of the iron and steel industry with whom his relations were also strained, Schmidt was exceedingly suspicious of anything resembling centralized control over the economy that would restrict the prerogatives of pri- vate enterprise.42 An insight into the power of the RWKS can be gained by examining the process of coal allocation. In general the RWKS, and the other syndicates, distributed coal within the loose guidelines established by the RVK. If a company desired additional coal or coal for a new plant, it forwarded a request to the nearest State Economic Office which made a preliminary evaluation and then passed it on to Berlin. Here the RVK, after consulting the Reich Transportation Ministry (Reichsverkehrsministerium, RVM), determined if the request was justified and if it could be fulfilled. Then the RWKS received it, compared it with information obtained from its own sources, and if it saw fit, allocated coal. Only very large consumers such as the major iron companies and the Reichsbahn could circumvent this process and deal directly with the syndicate. Consequently, because it alone controlled the coal
