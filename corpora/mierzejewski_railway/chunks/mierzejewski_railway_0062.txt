To the southwest was the region centered around Frankfurt/Main, the Ludwigshafen-Mannheim complex, and Stuttgart, featuring light and precision manufacturing, electrical engineering, and chemical industries. Finally, in Bavaria industries such as the engineering works at Nuremberg were also within the Ruhr’s orbit. @MAGOEBURG  OUISBURG  Page 26 of 282 1% bl eal — . nal ~ ~ = “— mninionniadl —_— 7” ~ owe ee ON afew modifying influences, the overall scale of industrial activity and its geographical configuration.

Like the Ruhr it developed heavy manufacturing industries of its own, albeit on a smaller scale. Its chief tributaries were the Baltic port and manufacturing center of Stettin, the aviation, engineering, and chemical works near Leipzig and Dresden, and the electrical engineering, armaments, and vehicle-manufactur- ing dynamo on the Spree, Berlin. ° ‘\ FRANKFURT-MAIN \ 4 MANRNET RESOURCE USE REGIONS * LUOWIGSHAFEN : RUHR 6 BAVARIA 2 NORTH SEA 7 BRUN TUTTGART ~ 4 FRANKEURT-MANNHEIM MUNICH® RON ORE Examining the economics of energy and raw material supply of functional components of the division of labor can help bring its contours into bold relief.
