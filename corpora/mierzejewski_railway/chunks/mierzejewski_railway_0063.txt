MUNICH® RON ORE Examining the economics of energy and raw material supply of functional components of the division of labor can help bring its contours into bold relief. One illustration is the iron and steel industry which was heavily dependent on the acquistion of iron ore from remote sources. In 1943 Germany obtained over 80 million tons of it with the largest share, 44 percent, composed of minette taken from annexed Lorraine. Imports from Sweden amounted to 12 percent of the total.42 The latter were greatly valued because of their high iron content and ease of smelting. National ore stocks in 1943 amounted to almost 20 million tons, sufficient for three months of normal operations.22 Total raw iron production was just over 24,200,000 tons and steel output was 30,600,000 tons.  The dominant force in all of these sectors was the Ruhr. In 1943 it received 26.5 million tons of iron ore of which a third arrived from Scandinavia and almost 18 percent from the minette region. The remainder was drawn from domestic sources.22 Almost 8 million tons were held in stock, sufficient for about three months of production.22 The region’s output of 9 million tons of raw iron con- stituted 44 percent of national output.+4 Its steel production was of similar proportions.45  Typifying the Ruhr was the giant United Steel Company (Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G., VSt) headquartered in Diisseldorf. The concern was formed in 1926 to meet the competition offered by large American firms.26 During the late twenties it modernized and rationalized its facilities which ran the gamut from coal mining to munitions plants. Among its holdings were the Gelsenkirchen Mining Company (Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks AG, GBAG), and famous steel mills such as Thyssen, Ruhrstahl, and the Bochumer Verein. It was headed initially by Albert Vogler who, though not a Nazi, was on good terms with Goring and later with Speer. One of its board members, Walter Rohland, played a major role in Speer’s committee system. GBAG
