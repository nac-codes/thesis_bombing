initially by Albert Vogler who, though not a Nazi, was on good terms with Goring and later with Speer. One of its board members, Walter Rohland, played a major role in Speer’s committee system. GBAG produced 25.7 million tons of coal and 9.8 million tons of coke for its parent in 1943. It retained stocks equaling about ten days consumption.52 VSt consumed about 5.3 million tons of iron ore anually. Raw iron production was 5.9 million tons and raw steel output 7.2 million tons, in both cases about a quarter of the Reich’s total.28 VSt, in its overwhelming scale, integration of production processes and political clout was typical of the Ruhr’s dominance of basic production tied to strong influence in Berlin. It also illustrates how the steel industry located near its source of energy, hard coal, relied on distant sources of iron ore. The cost of transporting iron ore was considered to be lower than that of shipping enormous amounts of coal.  The central German industrial region, comprising Hanover, Kassel, and Brunswick depended upon the Ruhr for hard coal and semifinished goods and engaged in the manufacture of steel, armaments, vehicles, and machinery. It controlled its own ore supplies at Salzgitter and could draw upon nearby brown coal resources to supplement energy obtained from the Ruhr. It accounted for 10 percent of national raw iron output.52 The dominant factor in the iron and steel sector was the RWHG. In 1943 it consumed 2.6 million tons of coal, virtually all of it obtained from the RWKS over the Mittelland Canal and the Reichsbahn. It used 3.24 million tons of iron ore, most obtained locally, and produced 1.09 million tons of raw iron, about 5.5 percent of Reich output.©&2  More representative of the region’s manufacturing industry was the Krupp-Gruson plant at Magdeburg. The facility had been purchased by Krupp in the 1880s to help it enter the artillery and armor plate markets.® It produced the Mk IV medium tank, the 75 mm gun, and artillery shells of
