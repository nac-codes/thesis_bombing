It received components for them from Essen and from local subcontractors by rail. It turned to a diversified range of suppliers for energy. Gas was purchased from the Reichswerke Hermann Géring and the Magdeburg municipal works, brown coal was procured locally, coke came from the RWHG and Essen, and all of its hard coal from the Ruhr. The plant generated most of its own electricity, purchasing the rest from the municipal works.£ It kept stocks of coals and coke ranging from  Page 30 of 282 13% TUTTGART MUNICHe 1943 amounted to almost 20 million tons, sufficient for three months of normal operations.*2 Total raw iron production was just over 24,200,000 tons and steel output was 30,600,000 tons.51 The remainder was drawn from domestic sources.22 Almost 8 million tons were held in stock, sufficient for about three months of production.52 The region’s output of 9 million tons of raw iron con- stituted 44 percent of national output.+4 Its steel production was of similar proportions.+2 American firms.*6 During the late twenties it modernized and rationalized its facilities which ran the gamut from coal mining to munitions plants. Among its holdings were the Gelsenkirchen Mining of coke for its parent in 1943. It retained stocks equaling about ten days consumption.*2 VSt consumed about 5.3 million tons of iron ore anually. Raw iron production was 5.9 million tons and raw steel output 7.2 million tons, in both cases about a quarter of the Reich’s total.58 VSt, in its overwhelming scale, integration of production processes and political clout was typical of the Ruhr’s dominance the Mittelland Canal and the Reichsbahn. It used 3.24 million tons of iron ore, most obtained locally, and produced 1.09 million tons of raw iron, about 5.5 percent of Reich output.S2 p
