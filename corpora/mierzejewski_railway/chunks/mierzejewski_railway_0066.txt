hr’s dominance the Mittelland Canal and the Reichsbahn. It used 3.24 million tons of iron ore, most obtained locally, and produced 1.09 million tons of raw iron, about 5.5 percent of Reich output.S2 plate markets.& It produced the Mk IV medium tank, the 75 mm gun, and artillery shells of various calibers. It received components for them from Essen and from local subcontractors by rail. It turned to a diversified range of suppliers for energy. Gas was purchased from the Reichswerke Hermann Goring and the Magdeburg municipal works, brown coal was procured locally, coke came from the RWHG and Essen, and all of its hard coal from the Ruhr. The plant generated most of its own electricity, purchasing the rest from the municipal works.£2 It kept stocks of coals and coke ranging from four to seven weeks’ worth.®3 In the first quarter of 1944 it produced monthly an average of 2,592.3 tons of all products including 107 tanks, 137,000 shells, and 47 anti-aircraft pieces.64 Krupp-Gruson illustrates how even sizable armaments manufacturers in the tributary regions were dependent upon outside suppliers for energy raw materials, and components to complete their contracts. Not only were these needed in appropriate quantities, but they had to arrive on time to prevent the interruption of production.  A similar situation prevailed in Ludwigshafen on the Rhine at the company of Gebriider Giulini, which smelted bauxite into aluminum in a converted chemical works. The plant could process 145,000 tons of bauxite per annum, or about a fifth of total German capacity.£2 In 1943 it obtained 303,808 tons of bauxite, all by rail and all from regions outside of Germany, enabling it to accumulate extensive stocks. It purchased 71,655 tons of hard coal from the RWKS local representative, the Kohlenkontor Weyhenmeyer, and 38,107 tons of brown coal from the Cologne area through the Rhenish Brown Coal Syndicate (Rheinisches Braunkohlensyndikat, RBS) which arrived both by rail and by barge.£© The com
