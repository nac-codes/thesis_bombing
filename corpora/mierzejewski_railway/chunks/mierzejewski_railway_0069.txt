These firms typified the industries of the satellite regions and their energy relationships to the two hard coal producing centers. It should not be forgotten, however, that many other companies made important contributions to the German war effort. Some were similar in size to those discussed above. Others consumed only a few tons of coal, a few hundred cubic meters of gas, and a few  thousand kilowatt-hours of electricity. They produced perhaps only a few thousand kilograms of goods.

In 1943 it consumed 2.6 million tons of coal, virtually all of it obtained from the RWKS over the Mittelland Canal and the Reichsbahn. It used 3.24 million tons of iron ore, most obtained locally, and produced 1.09 million tons of raw iron, about 5.5 percent of Reich output.2 plate markets.1 It produced the Mk IV medium tank, the 75 mm gun, and artillery shells of various calibers. It received components for them from Essen and from local subcontractors by rail. It turned RWHG and Essen, and all of its hard coal from the Ruhr.
