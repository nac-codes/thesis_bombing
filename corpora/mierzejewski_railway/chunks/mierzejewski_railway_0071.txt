BEWAG served all the city’s manufacturers and like them averaged seven weeks’ consumption.§8 The utility’s head was Dr. Richard Fischer, who was also the Reich Load Distributor. On the warm early summer day of 17 June 1942, Paul Pleiger sat at his desk writing a letter to Albert Speer that would be like the cold blast of winter on the new minister’s rosy production plans. Pleiger explained that coal production was rising but shortages threatened to develop among consumers. The Reichsbahn could not ship all the coal that was cut.1 He calculated that transportation problems caused the loss of over 60 million tons of all types of coal in the preceding year, almost 27 million tons to industry alone.2 Disaster could be avoided, he argued, only if the Reichsbahn provided him with 22,000 more cars per day.2 As he had put it in May, “The coal situation can ... be considered as purely a transportation problem.”4  The head of the Reich Coal Association was not alone in sounding the alarm. The Reich Iron Association estimated that over 2 million tons of iron would be lost because of a lack of coal in the period from October 1942 to March 1943.5 Blast furnaces in occupied France and Belgium and many rolling mills in Germany ran well below capacity due to a lack of fuel.£ On being informed of this Hitler warned Pleiger that “if the output of the steel industry cannot be increased as foreseen because of a shortage of coking coal, the war is lost.”2  The division of labor that shaped the German economy was based on coal.
