aller to telephone any other location simply by dialing the appropriate number without contacting an operator. Basas were given to all of the directorate headquarters and other major operating locations such as repair shops and yards.22 Special communications repair trains equipped with stores of spares and tools and manned by technicians were kept in constant readiness. Supplies of materials were stored at locations removed from stations and other likely bombing targets. Communications rooms were hardened against blast and splinters. Dispersed sites were equipped with communications apparatus and mobile Basas were set up in freight cars and trucks.21  Long before the war it was recognized that whatever precautions were taken, telephone, and telegraph systems remained vulnerable to air attack. Consequently radios were provided to major offices to assure emergency communications links. They were never available in sufficient numbers and the DR fought a losing battle with the Wehrmacht for frequencies.22 But radio opened another vulnerability that was immediately identified and addressed. The offices in Berlin, each RBD headquarters, and the GBLs were equipped with an Enigma cipher machine.22 This channel was open only to high officials such as Dorpmiiller and his immediate subordinates and the presidents of the RBDs and GBLs.24 The use of the Enigma by the Reichsbahn was shrouded in secrecy at the time, and virtually all traces of it were intentionally erased by DR personnel just prior to the capitulation in 1945. Yet it is clear that Enigma was used right up until the end and grew in importance as the war neared its conclusion. As fears increased concerning the security of its other channels and as land lines were cut by bombing, the DR relied more heavily upon its supposedly unbreakable cipher.22  The care taken to mask its inner workings and to ensure the flow of information despite external interference was matched by the Reichsbahnâ€™s preparations to maintain the
