osedly unbreakable cipher.22  The care taken to mask its inner workings and to ensure the flow of information despite external interference was matched by the Reichsbahnâ€™s preparations to maintain the movement of traffic. Like all public organizations in the Third Reich, the DR created a chapter of the Reich Air Defense League (Reichsluftschutzbund), dubbed the Railway Air Protection Service (Eisenbahn Luftschutzdi- enst). It monitored the air situation based on information obtained from the Luftwaffe and its own offices and issued air-raid warnings. When attack appeared imminent, trains halted in tunnels and wooded areas and the crews disembarked. No train could enter or leave a yard during an attack. Yards ceased operations during raids but worked until the last possible moment. Then crews took to shrapnel shelters and small concrete bunkers erected near their work places. Occasionally they used the heavier bunkers built to protect the traveling public.2&  In February 1944 the increased weight of air attack on German industry prompted the DR to establish a central Air Raid Control Office (Luftschutzbefehlstelle) in the Transportation Ministry. It was responsible for allocating manpower and materials to regions struck by air raids.22 Prior to the war, repair columns had been formed consisting of a total of 16,000 men of whom 5,700 were from the DR itself. They were committed to the restoration of heavily damaged yards.28 Organic repair personnel handled lesser damage. The DR had always fielded dedicated right-of-way repair trains.
