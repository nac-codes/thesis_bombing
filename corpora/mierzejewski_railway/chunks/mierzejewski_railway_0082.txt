First, through service was restored so as to limit disruption 1:0 the particular yard hit. Next, the marshalling section was repaired. Then, freight and passenger loading facilities were tackled and finally, roundhouses.32  From the outset it was recognized that these preparations might prove inadequate in the face of concerted attack. Therefore plans were laid to compensate for the temporary loss of major components of the system.
