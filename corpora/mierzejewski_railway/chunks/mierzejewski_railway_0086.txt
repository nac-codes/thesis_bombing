both by shortening the average flow of goods and by eliminating the phenomenon of similar products passing each other on the rails, headed to adjacent consumers and shippers. Kehrl also sought to limit overall demand by concentrating transport on the most important goods, such as coal and steel, and reducing or eliminating transport of other types of freight.42 To make shippers more aware of the program, the Reichs- bahn initiated an advertising campaign with the theme “Wheels must roll for victory.”44 Like the Transport Office, Kehrl ended his intervention in transportation affairs in the autumn of 1942.  Of somewhat longer-lasting significance was the Bureau for Transportation Organization. It functioned from November 1942 until I September 1943 under contract with the RWM to continue Kehrl’s program based on studies it had previously conducted independently As of September 1943 it was incorporated in the ministry and thereafter lost influence. It examined the economic relation- ships of the Reich’s industrial regions and instituted measures that rationalized freight flows.42  All of these organizational measures initiated by Speer were transitory in nature although they did greatly assist the Reichsbahn in overcoming the 1942 crisis. More permanent was the Central  Page 40 of 282 16% for coal transport in the Four Year Plan Office.4! This body was run by Milch with Speer remaining in the background. It instituted measures to speed loading of cars and to shift traffic from the rails to ships of the Reich’s industrial regions and instituted measures that rationalized freight flows.45 Transportation Directorate (Zentralverkehrsleitstelle, ZVL). It was the direct analogue to his industrial committees and rings, and its formation fundamentally altered the means of controlling trans- port in the Reich. The ZVL was headed by the fifty-six-year-old Ernst Emrich, who had begun his railroad career in 1912 and was simultaneously head of GBL-East.46 Formed in June 1942, the
