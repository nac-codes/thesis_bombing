table for the heaviest traffic. Two-thirds of the main line was double tracked, and a further 3 percent had three or more tracks. About 3 percent, primarily in southern Germany, was electrified.5° (For the main freight arteries see Map 3.2.)  The vehicle park that moved on the Reichsbahn’s extensive and well-maintained rail net was massive by any standard. As of July 1944 it included 34,545 locomotives of which 32,295 were steam powered.5! They were housed at 740 Operating Works (Bahnbetriebswerke, Bwj backed by 95 Repair Works (Reichsbahn Ausbesserungswerke, RAW). The RAW were veritable factories capable of per- forming the most extensive repair projects.52 Some had staffs of over a thousand people.52  Like the rest of the economy, the Reichsbahn was heavily dependent on coal. Its locomotives consumed over 32 million tons of hard coal in 1943.54 Stocks were maintained at twenty days.55 Coal was purchased by the Central Office directly from the syndicates. Only certain types were acceptable and engineers went to the mines to select them. The chief supplier was the RWKS, which provided about 43 percent of the Reichsbahn’s needs with Upper Silesia satisfying about 40 percent.52  The voracious locomotives pulled an aggregation of 1,208,438 freight cars of which the DR owned 973,045.58 There were two basic types. Box cars, about a third of the total, were employed to move perishable or high unit value freight, while open cars, comprising two-thirds of the park, were used to ship bulk commodities such as coal. Both types had an average capacity of twenty tons. However, as of 1942 they were regularly overloaded with an additional one to two tons.52 Ganzenmulwler along with ochelp and Villl were Charged by opeer with infusing the Keicnsbanns fundamentally sound system with new energy. iney were to abandon the old conservative, powered.2!
