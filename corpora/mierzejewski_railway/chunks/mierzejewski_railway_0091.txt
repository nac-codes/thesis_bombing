Freight from a host of origins was directed to equally numerous destinations through a complicated method of sorting that functioned to a strict sched- ule both within single marshalling yards and among them. Cars were not loaded at marshalling yards. Instead small consignments were brought to loading sheds adjacent to them or near main pas- senger stations. Larger shipments were put aboard cars at loading docks operated by manufacturers connected to the main line by spurs. All major heavy industries and coal mines possessed their own loading facilities. At this point each car was given a card which was inserted into a pocket on its outside. It would accompany the car to its destination and be used in the sorting process. The card bore a stamp indicating the load’s priority with a code word such as “Panzer.” Cars were gathered by local trains and brought to a nearby marshalling yard where they were left in a set of tracks shaped like a gridiron called a reception group. The locomotive moved away for servicing. A small yard locomotive then pushed the line of cars, which had been uncoupled by workers, over a hump, a dirt mound over which track had been laid. Their own weight and gravity pulled them toward a second gridiron in which each track represented a route. Cars were lined up on the tracks of this sorting group in
