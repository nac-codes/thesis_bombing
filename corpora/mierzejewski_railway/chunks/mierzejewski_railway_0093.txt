the physica! to enable completed trains to depart during the early morning to deliver the freight during business hours. The entire marshalling process could be vastly more complicated if a yard served traffic flows coming from intersecting directions or if it was near a port. In any case, it was an exceedingly complex and delicate affair subject to disruption by weather and human error. Problems at one yard initially disliked by the Reichsbahn. But their advantages in terms of reduced marshalling grew in importance and they were used more frequently with every passing month. The importance and sensitivity of the marshalling process meant that the ZVL and the other offices responsible for the allocation of car space scrutinized their operations very closely. Inevitably most of their attention fell on three critical directorates that together set the pace for the entire Reichsbahn. They mirrored exactly the geographical division of labor since they were the hubs of coal traffic. The most important was RBD Essen (see Map 3.3). Alone it accounted for a tenth of all marshalling activities and more importantly originated 38 percent of the Reichsbahn’s hard coal movements. It held five of the DR’s ten largest marshalling yards. But sheer size was not the sole determinant of a marshalling yard’s importance. Also crucial was its location in relation both to industry originating traffic and to recipients. Consequently a few yards in RBD Essen and in the surrounding directorates were of overriding importance. They were identified by Riidiger Schmidt of the RWKS and, along with the Reichsbahn, he agonized daily over their well-being because they regulated the flow of coal from the Ruhr to its dependencies.$8  The largest such Ruhr gateway, situated in RBD Essen on the eastern edge of the region, northeast of Dortmund, was Hamm. It could assemble up to two hundred fifty-car trains per day (10,000 cars in all) making it the largest marshalling yard in Germany. It controlled the
