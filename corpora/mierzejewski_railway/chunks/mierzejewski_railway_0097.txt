all brown coal shipments.2 Its importance is belied by its overall freight car placing share since its operations were highly complex and were executed under extreme time pressure so as not to disrupt movement elsewhere. Its most important yards were at Halle, with a capacity of 4,800 cars per day, and Falkenberg, which could handle 7,000 cars daily.74 These three pivotal directorates, Essen, Halle, and Oppeln, determined the overall scale and pace of the Reichsbahn’s operations. They performed this role because of their association with the coa trade and because their geographical location made them originators or intermediaries for traffic in manufactured goods. Two directorates at the geographical extremities and one in the center were crucial factors determining not only the DR’s fate but that of Germany as well since they made possible the smooth functioning of the division of labor.  Special importance was accorded by Berlin to their mastering of coal traffic. RBDs Essen and Oppeln were given wide operational latitude in the matter. But the Main Car Office and the ZVL watche developments closely and maintained a reserve of coal cars in RBDs Halle, Berlin, and neighboring areas to overcome any irregularities in the traffic. A special effort was made to ship coal in unit trains, with regular runs rigidly established in the schedule and given priority over other trains.  A complicating factor was the seasonal variation in traffic patterns. The summer was the quietest period as demand for coal was lowest. Then the pace quickened in September as firms rushed to accumulate stocks for the winter. A few weeks later a heavy, urgent demand for cars developed in the East to move the harvest westward to the urban areas before it spoiled. This was the most difficult time of the year for the Reichsbahn. After the harvest, traffic remained heavy until warm weather in the spring reduced the demand for coal and therefore for transport. The Reichsbahn continuously warned consu
