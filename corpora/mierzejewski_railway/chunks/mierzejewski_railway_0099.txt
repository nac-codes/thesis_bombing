lacing was the insertion of one car into a train. It was not synonymous with loading.72 In 1943 the Reichsbahn achieved its highest car placing total since 1916 by putting 48,614,078 cars into trains.78 The largest share went to coal, which amounted to almost a third of the cars.22 In 1943 about 14.5 million coal cars were placed. To facilitate comparison among the various sizes of coal cars they were discussed in terms of ten-ton units. By that measure, the one that will also be used througout this account, 26,266,876 were placed.8° Measured by weight, just to put these figures into perspective, coal accounted for 43 percent of the DR’s total freight burden.8! The Reichsbahn placed an average of 81,696 coal units per day in November 1943 of which 57,197 were for hard coal and 21,499 were for brown coal.82 The overall target fluctuated between 81,000 and 83,000, depending upon the season and other circumstances.  A second major measurement was backlog, that is, trains delayed more than two hours after scheduled departure time. In 1943 the average daily backlog system wide was 282 trains.84  Another revealing yardstick was the amount of time necessary to unload and reload a car. This turnaround time stood at six and a half days in November 1943.85 The faster cars were turned around the fewer would be needed to run a given volume of traffic.  Finally, the stock of coal available for use by the DR’s locomotives measured in number of days consumption will be observed. It provides a very reliable indication of the state of coal traffic in general, since Reichsbahn coal shipments enjoyed first priority. It is also an accurate measure of the health of locomotive service. The emergency stock level was ten days.86 In the summer of 1943, service coal stocks hovered around the nineteen-day level.82  The Reichsbahn achieved its best performance of the war in 1943. Speer’s managerial reforms had enabled it to realize its full potential in concert with the increase in armaments p
