service between major urban areas such as Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne, Frankfurt, and Stuttgart, the very centers of economic activity. To accommodate the crack expresses, roadbeds and signals were improved. This also benefited freight traffic as its average speed in- creased by a third.26 An extensive series of improvements was made to marshalling yards beginning in the 1920s and culminating in the extension and modernization of yards in eastern Germany leanne car dammed — accumulate stocks for the winter. A few weeks later a heavy, urgent demand for cars ; developed i in the East to move the harvest westward to the urban areas before it spoiled. This w: was the most difficult warned consumers to accumulate stocks during the summer months when car space was plentiful. But inevitably they failed to seize the opportunity.26 1943 the Reichsbahn achieved its highest car placing total since 1916 by putting 48,614,078 cars into trains.78 The largest share went to coal, which amounted to almost a third of the cars.72 In 1943 througout this account, 26,266,876 were placed.8° Measured by weight, just to put these figures into perspective, coal accounted for 43 percent of the DR'’s total freight burden.81 The Reichsbahn placed upon the season and other circumstances.83 production.2° Coal car placings were also near target, but the overall tonnage sought by the RVK, 275 million for the coal economy year 1943/44, was not met by almost 5 percent.2! Again this was between 1940 and 1942.22 Operations were mechanized to the latest standard with retarders, remote control switches, and radios.28 The number of marshalling locomotives was increased fifteenfold between 1932 and 1938.22 In comparison with 1913 (see Table 3.1), in 1938 the DR possessed more freight cars and fewer but more powerful locomotives, placed more cars in trains, and carried a third more freight. This was in spite of an increase in average haul by more than half and a rise in turnaround time by a third. Whereas in
