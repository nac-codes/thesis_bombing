chsbahn through the GVLs and the BVLs.1% This weak and loosely organized apparatus administered a fleet of 19,248 vessels of 8,262,170 tons burthen. They were manned by 45,858 people of whom about 6 percent were female and almost a third foreigners.10 Altogether they moved 82 million tons of freight in 1943.126 Their most important cargo was coal, accounting for 37 percent of their load.122 On the western canals about 40 per- cent of barge capacity was occupied by coal and on the Rhine, 60 percent.108 The configuration of the system (see Map 3.4) reflected its role in the division of labor. The Rhine supported north-south traffic between the Ruhr and its southwestern tributaries. On the more than 1,300 kilometers of its navigable length plied 4,177 vessels. Barges averaged 1,000 tons capacity. Total available space on all types of vessels amounted to 3,238,074 tons.102 A large number of ports op- erated along the great river; however, a few of these illustrate the nature of its traffic and will be watched throughout this account. The most important was the sprawling Duisburg-Ruhrort complex. In 1943 it handled about 10 million tons of freight of which almost half was coal.1/2 It contributed about three-quarters of all coal shipments from Ruhr ports on the Rhine.1 At the receiving end of this flow was Mannheim which accepted about 70 percent of all coal shipped southward from the Ruhr. Its port had its own briquette factory to process brown coal and was easily accessible by rail from all of the nearby industries. In 1943 it processed over 4 million tons of freight of which about three-quarters consisted of coal arriving from the Rhine-Ruhr region.112  Serving the Ruhrâ€™s dependencies to the north and east and acting as its conduit for iron ore from Scandinavia was the Dortmund-Ems Canal (DEK). It was completed in 1899 to accommodate barges of 750-ton capacity and was rebuilt after World War I to accept vessels up to 1,500 tons burthen.112 About 1,400 craft operated on
