It connected with the Elbe at Minden via locks and passed over the river by an aqueduct. Its principal ports were at Hanover and Salzgitter, the latter serving the Reichswerke Hermann Goring.18 Using the spectacular shiplift at Rothensee near Magdeburg and then navigating the rivers Elbe and Havel and associated canals, barges could reach Berlin. The MLK carried about 18 million tons of freight, half of which was coal, as measured at Minden.112  Berlin was primarily dependent for its waterborne trade on the Oder via the Oder-Spree Canal. The predominant traffic was hard coal from Upper Silesia with brown coal from central Germany playing a lesser role. The Oder was home to 2,343 vessels with a combined payload of 854,135 tons. They were smaller than the Rhine and west German canal barges averaging 430 tons capacity. Nearby canals were plied by 2,413 craft capable of toting 577,882 tons of freight. They too were relatively small barges having a median capacity of 307 tons.122  About 13.5 million tons of freight were handled by Berlin’s ports each year with coal constituting almost 29 percent of the total. Two-thirds of the coal originated in Upper Silesia. The source of most of the f
