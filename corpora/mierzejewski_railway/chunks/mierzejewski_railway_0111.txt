million tons of freight were handled by Berlin’s ports each year with coal constituting almost 29 percent of the total. Two-thirds of the coal originated in Upper Silesia. The source of most of the flow was the port of Gleiwitz. It was connected to the Oder by the Adolf Hitler Canal completed in 1940 and capable of accommodating 750-ton barges.42! Virtually all of its traffic was in coal shipments which amounted to about 4.5 million tons per year.122 @ AACHEN MANNHEIM LUDWIGSHAFEN®, ® ° ¥ > @NUREMBERG Adolf Hitter  *®GLEIWITz Canal  Completing the western waterway system was the Mittelland Canal (MLK) finished in 1938, which could accommodate vessels of up to 1,700 tons displacement.112 The MLK was traveled by the Salzgitter, the latter serving the Reichswerke Hermann Goring.1!8 Using the spectacular shiplift at Rothensee near Magdeburg and then navigating the rivers Elbe and Havel and associated canals, Berlin was primarily dependent for its waterborne trade on the Oder via the O:  er-Spree Canal. The predominant traffic was hard coal from Upper Silesia with brown coal from central Germany  About 13.5 million tons of freight were handled by Berlin's ports each year with coal constituting almost 29 percent of the total.

Virtually all of its traffic was in coal  The full potential of the web of waterways was never exploited because of the ad  ministrative obstacles mentioned earlier. Their value was further limited by their susceptibility to interference by  the weather. Traffic was halted for a few weeks each winter due to ice and was restricted during summer by low water. Aside from the objections of the boatmen, it was difficult to utilize ships built for one waterway on another because of their different characteristics. Finally, becaus
