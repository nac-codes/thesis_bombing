Pleiger painted a bleak picture of coal production hamstrung by lack of transport, stocks at factories shrinking to half of what they had been a year before, and piles at the mines mushrooming. The downward slide was accelerating, he warned, and drastic action was needed to arrest it. He demanded 86,000 coal cars per day; 25,000 for the Ruhr and 28,000 for Upper Silesia122 had disrupted the flow of coal there. The Reichsbahn was even sending in coal from the Ruhr. This created a drain on its strength because many of its cars were being swept up in the turmoil and never  returned to Germany.128 Kehrl cautioned that the Reich was on the verge of plunging into a major coal emergency.122  Speer agreed that Germany was on the brink of a crisis which could determine the outcome of the war. He predicted that violent attacks on marshalling yards in Germany would begin soon. Although he hoped for a vigorous defense by the Luftwaffe he emphasized that the key would be how well the Reichsbahn and especially its repair crews in the critical Ruhr marshalling yards would weather the storm.132 The fate of coal supplies and with them Speer’s entire finely balanced industrial organism lay with the Allied bomber commanders. It is to them that we turn next. of the flow was the port of ‘Gleiwitz. It was connected to the Oder by the Adolf Hitler Canal completed in 1940 and capable of accommodating 750-ton barges.121 Virtually all of its traffic was in coal to meet the needs of Speer’s arms production scheme. In the coal economy year 1943/44 the barges and tugs moved almost a quarter less coal than in the preceding year and almost a tenth less than output fell 5 percent behind its target.124 The Reichsbahn narrowly failed to meet its goal and the waterways were far away from theirs.125 The result was a marked tightening of
