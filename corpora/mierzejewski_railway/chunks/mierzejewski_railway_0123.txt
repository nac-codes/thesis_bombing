ghly strained German industrial-military system to topple. Therefore, as a rough guide, this measure, one-quarter to one-third reduction, will serve asa standard against which to measure the results of the transportation offensive. Because the availability of weapons to the military is a function of stocks as well as production, they too must be taken into account. As a crude guide, the pipeline, a further complicating factor, will be taken as having a three- to eight-month duration depending upon the weapon or commodity.’ Production declines caused by territorial losses can also be calculated. Losses due to direct damage to factories cannot be disaggregated from overall production statistics. However they can be for specific factories on some occasions. Impressionistic evidence from plant officials can supplement statistical data. But it must be borne in mind that during the fall of 1944 and after, the synergistic effects of direct damage and the loss of transport can not be quantified. They can only be hinted at. The one-quarter to one-third standard is useful equally for measuring the bombing offensive’s accomplishments against either the standard of complete collapse or of paving the way for a ground offensive. Speer’s finely balanced system was rocked by smaller setbacks and it is hard to imagine how a 25 to 33 percent reduction in the number of divisions facing the Red Army and the Western Allies could not have greatly accelerated their advance. Moreover, in light of the information available from sources open to Allied air intelligence staffs, leaving out that obtained from covert sources, it is also reasonable to argue that they could have used a similar standard at the time. ae a _ [re French output never attained its prewar level.£ What contributions were derived from these quarters, except Bohemia, were lost to Germany from August 1944. with the ability to switch its military forces among the various fronts more easily. Moreover, the German army remained
