By April 1944 the Americans had recognized the need for fighter escort and had built a force of 1,942 P-51 Mustangs, P-47 Thunderbolts, and P-38 Lightnings to protect their bombers. The Eighth Air Force controlled 1,242 and the Fifteenth 700 of them.12 The fighters could contribute little to the weight of bombs dropped on Germany, although they could strafe targets such as locomotives. Their importance lay in the shield that they gave to the bombers and the casualties that they inflicted on the Luftwaffe. The crucial feature of these forces was their over- whelming size. By a conservative estimate, the Allied strategic bomber forces could deliver an average of over 100,000 tons of bombs per month.13 This meant that a single target system could be inundated with explosives or that simultaneously a number could be struck heavily. The power of the forces at their disposai by the spring of 1944 was not understood by the Allied bomber com- manders. Their attitude was shaped by memories of 1942 and 1943 when their forces had been raided for aircraft to reinforce the North African theater and the Pacific and to counter the U-boat threat. But by 1944 scarcity had given way to abundance. The Allied bomber commanders fought to concentrate their forces against a limited number of target systems and objectives. In doing so they under- estimated what their forces could do. This fear of dispersal of effort, combined with their desire to win the war
