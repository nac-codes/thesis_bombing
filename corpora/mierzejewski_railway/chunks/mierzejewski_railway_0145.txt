e attack and because considerable industrial capacity in Germany was idle. He also thought that railways carried an insufficient share of freight in Germany to matter.52  EOU itself never studied transportation, let alone the Reichsbahn.* Instead it relied on papers prepared by others such as MAAF. On 8 February 1944 it counseled USSTAF that the delay incurred by attacks on marshalling yards was “immaterial.” It underscored the “vast cushion of excess capacity” available to the railway and the economy in general.52 It could make this argument because it valued only purely military traffic. Its rejection of general attack led it to conclude that disrupting economic traffic would be irrelevant because of the delayed effect it would have on the Wehrmacht. In light of the frantic hunt for every ton of coal and steel in Germany this view can only be called astonishing.  A special Army Air Forces Evaluation Board consisting of intelligence officers drawn from Washington, Britain, and the Mediterranean also gave its interpretation. It too concluded that marshalling yards were not suitable targets for cutting the flow of traffic and stressed the surplus of vehicles enjoyed by the Reichsbahn. In its view, bridges in general offered far better potential for interrupting the flow of traffic.52 Given these wildly inaccurate assessments, one might conclude that there was a dearth of information available about the Reichsbahn. But AWPD and others did come to accurate appreciations. They were based on overt sources, many of which were available before the war. MEW was hard at work during the spring of 1944 on a set of very comprehenisve handbooks on the German economy that presented an accurate picture of the coal industry and the role of the Reichsbahn and the inland waterways.=4 Even earlier, in December 1942, MEW had pointed out that the coal-mining sector was especially vulnerable to disruption from indirect causes such as transportation snarls.23 The RRS produced a number of
