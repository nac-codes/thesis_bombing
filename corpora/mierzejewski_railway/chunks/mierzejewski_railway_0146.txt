He especially underscored the importance of those in the Ruhr.*6 In another report prepared at the same time, he deprecated attacking locomotives, even bombing their servicing sheds and facilities, unless the assault were part of an offensive against marshalling yards.*Z In March 1941 Sherrington completed another paper that was distributed both to Bomber Command and later to the Eighth Air Force, in which he advocated attacking railroad centers, those key locations where marshalling and vehicle servicing took place.
