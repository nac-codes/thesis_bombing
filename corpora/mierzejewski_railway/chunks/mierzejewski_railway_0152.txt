that would reverberate throughout the system and lead to its paralysis. Zuckerman realized that pinpoint accuracy could not be achieved by bombers. Particular sections of yards could not be singled out for attack. So he suggested that “railwav centers” should be bombed as units. All of the kev features of the railwav svstem would be assailed simultaneouslv where thev were grouved together. Zuckerman also noticed that a coal  Page 78 of 282 28% taneously realize the old dream of strategic bombing theorists of bringing down the enemy economy. “railway centers” should be bombed as units. All of the key features of the railway system would be assailed simultaneously where they were grouped together. Zuckerman also noticed that a coal shortage had developed in Sicily and southern Italy at the same time the transportation attacks had taken place. He could not pinpoint its cause. But he discerned that it had dire consequences for the economy. This was suggestive. He and Tedder were well aware of the importance of the Ruhr. They hoped that if attacks could be extended eastward into Germany they would also prevent the Ruhr from supplying coal to its dependencies. Under the pressure of events Zuckerman had not formulated a completely accurate picture of the system that he hoped to attack, underrating the importance of the marshalling process. But he understood enough to nominate it for destruction as part of the railway center and to convince Tedder of the correctness of his choice. Moreover, he continued to de- velop his ideas in light of newly available evidence. Speer’s worst fears were being embodied by the Deputy Supreme Commander and his advisor. While Tedder and Zuckerman were perfecting their scheme and shepherding it through the various intelligence and command eche-lons, EOU prepared a plan of its own. EOU had reacted violently against the transportation plan as soon as it learned of it.S4 In its view, the scheme was of a purely tactical nature since no attack on a
