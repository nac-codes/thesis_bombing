EOU had reacted violently against the transportation plan as soon as it learned of it.S4 In its view, the scheme was of a purely tactical nature since no attack on a railway could possibly achieve strategically meaningful results. A few weeks later, EOU prepared a comprehensive plan for the use of the Allied strategic air forces. It correctly perceived that the Eighth Air Force was seizing air superiority over Germany during the last week of February 1944. It proposed to exploit this unprecedented opportunity by launching a massive attack on Germany’s synthetic fuel refineries and supporting crude oil processing facilities.
