It concluded that “oil alone, among the remaining target systems, offers the opportunity, if completed, of bringing the German war effort to a close.”§7 In a comprehensive review of other prospective target systems, EOU rejected all of them. It condemned railways because there was too great a “cushion of civilian and long-term industrial use” between them and the fighting units.S&  But EOU’s analysis erred. Undoubtedly the denial of fuel to the Wehrmacht would have major military consequences. However, EOU promised this only six months into the future and Overlord was only two months away. Tedder’s plan promised faster results at the tactical level. The notion that liquid fuel was crucial to German industrial activity was wholly erroneous. As we have seen, the German economy derived 90 percent of its energy from coal. The hope for a break in the morale of OKW utterly ignored the role of Hitler and the loyalty that he still commanded both in the Wehrmacht and among the German people. Undoubtedly, gauging the latter factor correctly would have been difficult or impossible under the circumstances. But to argue that an oil campaign would ruin the German economy was more the result of projecting the image of their own economy onto that of Germany than careful intelligence analysis. Information concerning Germany’s dependence on coal, as noted above, was easily available in classified publications and in open, unclassified sources dating from before the war.  Oblivious to these flaws in its scheme, EOU launched a bureaucratic guerrilla campaign against the transportation plan.£2 Tedder relied on his good relations with Eisenhower and Portal to counter it. The result was a compromise that provided for attacks on both transportation and oil. This was possible because Tedder anticipated using only about half of the bombing capacity available from the strategic air forces. The oil compaign, with its roughly fifty targets, could be accommodated by remaining capacity. Many of
