trains destined for France clogged the sidings. Trains that were sent into France frequently did not return, thus creating a shortage of empty cars.22 During the third quarter, freight and coal car placings were a third below normal.22 The most immediate effect of this was a fuel shortage in the Saar and a decline in minette arrivals of 98 percent.24 The iron and steel industry was forced to consume stocks to maintain production. But iron output dropped by 43 percent and steel production by 40 percent.25 Since the Saar contributed almost a third of national iron production and a quarter of steel output, these losses represented a major blow to Speer’s production plans. The Saar ceased to bea significant factor in German industrial life. But the Ruhr continued to work at a high pitch. Steel output continued normally into September. This was accomplished at the expense of stockpiles. Arrivals of Swedish ore began to decline only in September. Minette supplies virtually ceased at the end of August.26 Since the Ruhr was not heavily dependent on minette, this was not important by itself. However, with the impending cessation of Swedish deliveries, it was a harbinger of problems lying just over the horizon. Stocks were reduced in August to 22 percent below normal.22 Raw iron output in August declined by only 4 percent.28 The case of Vereinigte Stahlwerke illustrates the situation nicely. Iron and steel production both proceeded satisfactorily compared to the monthly aver-  Page 86 of 282 31% West, appealed to the RWKS to transfer some of its coal t traffic to the waterways. Initially, though, the syndicate balked. to form them at the mines as was being done in Upper Silesia.1& and Réchling agreed to compensate by increasing shipments of minette.1Z But during August, overall ore movements fell by a quarter. Shipments by water, especially on the Rhine, held steady but rail- did not return, thus creating a shortage of empty cars.22 During the third quarter, freight and coal
