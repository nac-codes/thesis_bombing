ore movements fell by a quarter. Shipments by water, especially on the Rhine, held steady but rail- did not return, thus creating a shortage of empty cars.22 During the third quarter, freight and coal car placings were a third below normal.23 The most immediate effect of this was a fuel shortage in age of the previous year. Coal and coke output by GBAG were also normal. But coal stocked at the mines had quadrupled and coke holdings at the ovens had quintupled. Coal and coke stock at the mills had not changed dramatically. But ore stocks were down by a quarter and supplies of Swedish ore were half of the level held ordinarily.22 The result was that the leaders of the Ruhr steel industry clamored for increased car space for iron ore. They did so primarily not because they faced an impending decline in output but because they refused to exhaust their stockpiles to support the Nazis.22 Vogler, Rohland, and the rest had long been disenchanted with the Hitler regime, and now that defeat was closing in, they were positioning themselves for the postwar economic and political environ- ment. They sought to keep their plants intact as much as possible, maintain old business connections, and keep on hand a supply of raw materials that would permit them to resume production as soon as possible after the surrender. Elsewhere in the Ruhr, while the storm neared from the west, production continued as usual. In Diisseldorf no major production difficulties appeared among either utilities or armaments works.31  In the Ruhr hinterland to the south, the problems confronting RBD Saarbriicken were repeated at Mannheim, Karlsruhe, and Stuttgart. GBL-South reported in early September that, although it had sufficient locomotives, marshalling difficulties were badly snarling t traffic. Telecommunications were seriously disrupted and train movement was restricted to the nighttime. 32 The inevitable result  ee ee Pe Pee en Tee re ee ee Perera Saree ay eer re a Se oe ne Se a cc Foes ae Sc Scere
