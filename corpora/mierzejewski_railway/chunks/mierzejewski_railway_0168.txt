Riidiger Schmidt hoped to raise this to a third.32 To the east, GBL-East encountered problems with traffic moving to directorates to the west.38 By early September, operations were strained because of difficulty exchanging traffic with GBLs West and South. In RBD Oppeln problems arose due to the need to handle traffic moving west to escape the onrushing Red Army.32 This was a new factor. Its importance would grow during the coming months.
