of 16 percent in overall car placings and 18 percent in hard coal car placings in the third quarter of 1944.42 Traffic on the Oder at the coal ports of Oppeln and Gleiwitz ran normally, preventing a major emergency.4! Hard coal cut in the region fell 4 percent below the previous year’s standard during August.42 Iron production declined by 5 percent.42 Coal stocks at armaments plants remained satisfactory though some types were unavailable. Supplies of components were adequate and the region’s armaments plants met their tar-gets.44 At Upper Silesia’s major dependency, Berlin, the satisfactory functioning of the waterways enabled production to continue uninterrupted.45 BEWAG had no difficulty meeting electrical demand.46 Coal stocks approached two months. Arrivals from the Ruhr were sharply reduced but supplies from Upper Silesia had compensated. So too in the city’s armaments plants. Speer’s armaments inspectors de- tected no major difficulties into September.42  The Reich economy had withstood the intitial shocks of transportation bombing remarkably well. It had done so by using stocks and by shifting priorities in the employment of labor, components, and materials. Only the Saar had suffered a major collapse. The effects of this were not immediately felt in final production. But the region’s loss reduced the nation’s overall armaments potential be- cause of the role it played, second only to the Ruhr, in steel production. No significant difficulties arose in hard coal output which declined by only 2 percent. Brown coal output fell by 5 percent due to the disruption of transport west of the Rhine. Coke production was off by only 1.5 percent.48 Electricity and gas supplies were also adequate.42 The key indicator was the rise in stocks at the mines. Hard coal stocks jumped 462 percent, coke holdings at the ovens 580 percent, and brown coal at the pits 400 percent compared to summer 1943.50 Although production was not interrupted, the fruits  Page 89 of 282 32% becomi
