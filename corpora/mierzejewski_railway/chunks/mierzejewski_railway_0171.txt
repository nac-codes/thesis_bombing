the Saar and elsewhere scrap could be substituted for high-content ore.53 Consequently steel production fell by 16 percent.44 While basic industries sustained their first setbacks, armaments final production, using materials and components that had entered the industrial process months before, continued its second great wartime boom. In July 1944 the armaments final production index peaked at 322. Only the initial spurt between February 1942 and May 1943 exceeded the March-July 1944 period in rate of monthly growth.5= These months saw production of many important weapons—the Panther tank, 88 millimeter anti-tank ammu- nition, 105 millimeter Flak, and the K98 carbine—reach the highest levels of the war.56 This astonishing success was possible because Speer and Kehr] had fashioned an organization that could exploit Germany’s limited resources relatively efficiently. But they understood the implications for the future of the transportation attacks that gradually spread eastward during June. Consequently, they took precautions immediately after the invasion to counteract their anticipated effects.52  The first intiative taken by Speer was to have Hitler sign an order for the “Concentration of Armaments and War Production.”58 It provided for a drastic reduction in development work on new weap- ons. This would allow engineers to be transferred to other industries where they could develop means to save raw materials by introducing new production processes and simplifying weapons designs. Commissioners would be named to supervise the implementation of the order. A week later Speer ordered that iron and steel allocations to manufacturers of machines, vehicles, and armaments be ae ee ee ee Se ee ee ee ee ee me ee ee ee eee eee At Upper Silesia’s major dependency, Berlin, the satisfactory functioning of the waterways enabled production to continue uninterrupted.45 BEWAG had no difficulty meeting electrical demand.46 Coal and materials.
