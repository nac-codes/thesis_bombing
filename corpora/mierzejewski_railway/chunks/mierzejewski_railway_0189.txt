ure: it confirmed the existing target priorities but ordered greater concentration of effort both geographically and in time. All air forces were to focus the heaviest possible attack on the Ruhr in order to demonstrate Allied military and air superiority to the German people and to create the maximum disorganization of the communications and administrative apparatus of the region. To this end, the bombers were ordered to hit marshalling yards, viaducts, and the area’s canals. The high operational proficiency of the Allied air forces allowed them to respond to this order immediately. The pound- ing from the air virtually stopped waterway traffic serving the region and gravely weakened rail service. The result was a severe drop in the production of basic goods in the Ruhr itself and the spread Page 100 of 282 36% Bottomley on 13 October 1944.3 It set in motion Operation Hurricane I. As with every bombing directive, this one also was a compromise. But it was a compromise with an important new feature: it of a deadly coal famine to its dependencies in south and central Germany. The distribution of components and the delivery of finished goods were disrupted. Final production in sectors selected by Speer continued at a very high level but only at the cost of depleting stocks of fuel and components. The Reichsbahn was forced to struggle on without the help of the waterways or the Luftwaffe. Allied air superiority left both the DR and the inland waterways naked to attack. As Ganzenmiiller put it to a gathering of operations officers on 20 October, “We cannot rely on our Luftwaffe, but on our own powers of resistance.”6 Three sharp blows, one of which was a lucky break, sufficed to sever all of the Ruhr waterway outlets. On the night of 22-23 September, Bomber Command attacked the Dortmund-Ems Canal at Ladbergen, using 12,000-pound bombs. The embankments were broken and the waterway drained, sweeping barges into the surrounding countryside. All traffic was halted, and 130
