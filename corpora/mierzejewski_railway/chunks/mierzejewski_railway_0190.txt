the Dortmund-Ems Canal at Ladbergen, using 12,000-pound bombs. The embankments were broken and the waterway drained, sweeping barges into the surrounding countryside. All traffic was halted, and 130 vessels backed up on the DEK south of Miinster. Making matters worse, the raid also cut telecommunications to the area, slowing the repair effort.2 The synergistic effects of transportation bombing now made themselves felt. The 2 October attack on the marshalling yard at Hamm destroyed fifteen carloads of repair tools destined for the DEK.’ Other raids on Miinster and Osnabriick delayed the arrival of materials and workers.2 Disputes arose among the various contractors engaged to do the actual repairs.12 When work did begin it was hampered by pesky Allied fighters that strafed the repair crews. While the DEK was closed, the ZVL gathered barges from the Ruhr in hopes of surging them through when the waterway reopened.1! Despite the obstacles, one of the two DEK passages was reopened on 21 October. The loss of a month’s traffic and the restricted capacity of the waterway when it did reopen meant that hard coal traffic north and east, as measured at the Miin- ster lock, was 89 percent lower in October than during the preceeding year.12 Just when it seemed that the Ruhr link to central Germany would be restored, the Eighth Air Force cut the MLK at Minden on 26 October.12 The B-24S struck the waterway as it passed over the Weser River causing not anlva long section of the canal ta drain hut alsa unleashing a tarrent that created a sandhar that restricted nassage on the river as well Sneer intervened immediately hv sending his  Page 101 of 282 37% our own powers of resistance.”& Three sharp blows, one of which was a lucky break, sufficed to sever all of the Ruhr waterway outlets. On the night of 22-23 September, Bomber Command attacked the River, causing not only a long section of the canal to drain, but also unleashing a torrent that created a sandbar that restricted passage
