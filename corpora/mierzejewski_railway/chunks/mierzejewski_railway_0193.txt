the Weser effort. The crews encountered difficulty in obtaining heavy equipment, which was in short supply in Germany, and in approaching the structure through the bomb-battered urban area surrounding it. On 19 October, the Organisation Todt began trying to blast a passage through the tangled mass of girders and the eighteen-foot steel beams that supported the roadway. Charges weighing up to seventeen tons were tried, all to no effect.18 Work continued unsuccessfully and south Germany’s coal supplies were severely reduced. They were subject to the vagaries of the level of the Rhine, which if high enough would allow barges with small loads to float over the wreckage, and to the uncertain service of the Reichsbahn. But the black day of the Ruhr, 14 October 1944, held more in store. Bomber Command pummeled Duisburg with a total of 9,329 tons of explosives and incendiaries in two raids. The harbor was devastated and the coal gateway at Wedau closed. Telecommunications were cut. Repair crews and damage clearance parties were hurried to the scene, but the damage was too great. Operations at Duisburg harbor and Ruhrort fell by half in October, almost all of the loss coming after the black day. Traffic from the DEK was down by 82 percent.12 There was little that the Transportation Ministry could do to counter these shattering disasters other than exhort the repair crews. In September it had increased movement on weekends. In late October it finally established freight priorities for the waterway system. And with winter fast approaching the ministry was compelled to bestow highest priority on the harvest. Second place was reserved for coal.22 But these measures were overwhelmed by the destruction wrought by the bombers. The Ruhr’s waterway connections to the rest of the Reich had been severed. Practically the en- tire burden of keeping Germany’s industrial body intact now rested on the Reichsbahn.  But the Reichsbahn itself was reeling under the relentless pounding from the
