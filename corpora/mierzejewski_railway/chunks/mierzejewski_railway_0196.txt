. They recognized that there was a real possibility that Germany would disintegrate into a number of uncoordinated economic areas. But they were faced with the stark reality that there was little that they could do to prevent this. Only the defeat of the bombers could fundamentally change the situation and they knew that no such event was in the offing. All they could do was adapt to circumstances. Hitler had already ordered that the Ruhr attempt to maintain production by relying on resources available internally.25 Speer also took the dangerous step of reorganizing the lower reaches of his ad- ministration. He combined his regional armaments inspectorates with the Economics Ministry’s local offices through an agreement with Franz Hayler.2&  In contrast, the Reichsbahn adhered to its proven system and simply pressed forward grimly with the daunting task of repairing damage and moving trains. Hordes of people were thrown into the repair effort. On 18 October, at Speer’s request, Hitler ordered that the repair of marshalling yards be given first call on labor even before fortification work. The Ruhr Staff ordered factory owners to form railway repair columns, fully equipped from their own resources. One team of 125 men would be created for each 5,000 employees. During the last week of October, 76,800 people were engaged in clearing rubble and repairing facilities in Reichsbahn labor teams alone.22  By announcing embargoes, the DR also attempted to reduce the volume of freight to correspond to the amount of car space available. Certain types of cargo in designated areas would be excluded until the freight backlog caused by the disruption of traffic was cleared. The first such embargo was proclaimed on 22 September and affected the left bank of the Rhine.
