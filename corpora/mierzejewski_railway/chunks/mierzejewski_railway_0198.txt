l night running. Hohenbudberg and Mannheim were relieved of responsibility for handling long-distance trains. Passenger trains were slowed to the same speed as freights to ease scheduling problems. A danger zone, during which daylight running was prohibited, was proclaimed west of a line running from the Dutch border to Rheine, Osterfeld-Siid, Wedau, Wuppertal-Vohwinckel, Lim- biirg, Frankfurt/Main, Heidelberg, Darmstadt, and Pforzheim to the Swiss border. Three days later all shipments to RBD Frankfurt/Main were embargoed. A special effort was made to reduce the back- log by breaking up trains and reallocating marshalling responsibilities to other directorates.22 The Reichsbahn took additional stringent measures to restore the flow of coal and other freight. It redistributed and rationalized responsibilities for serving particular mines and factories among the Miinster, Hamm, Soest, and Geisecke gateways.22 On 11 October, in a major departure, it abandoned its usual practice of returning backed up freight to the shipper. Now the Reichsbahn alone would decide where to send delayed goods, especially coal and perishables.24Late in the month it designated six marshalling yards in RBDs Regensburg and Schwerin for the formation of unit trains to ship freight westward.22 This move typified the way in which the Reichsbahn used GBL-East as a sanctuary to sustain operations in the west. It also began a program of equipping cars with light antiair- craft guns as protection against strafers.33  The ZVL engaged in the intricate process of altering priorities and allocating car space in light of rapidly changing conditions. At the outset of the period of bombing under special priority as of 21 September, armaments shipments had first call on car space, followed by the harvest.24 By the middle of October, after the setback of the fourteenth, coal had moved into the spotlight with the ZVL refusing to shift car space from the mining regions to the east to carry the harvest.35 On 20
