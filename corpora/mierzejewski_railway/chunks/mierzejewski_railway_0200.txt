A= MeCLITIE Ol of UCLODET LO decide where to send delayed goods, especially coal and perishables.31Late in the month it designated six marshalling yards in RBDs Regensburg and Schwerin for the formation of unit trains to ship beets.3 This meant that the goal for daily coal car placings was cut from 69,200 to 49,000 units. The Ruhr quota was slashed from 16,000 to 11,000.32 The sacrifice was more apparent than real placed on final production and means of distribution rather than on industries early in the production process. These coal priorities best fitted Speer’s scheme of seeking immediate results by drawing down stocks in hopes of stabilizing the battlefield and air situations.  All of the ZVL’s measures were intended to overcome the grave weakening of the marshalling yards in the west. Two mutually reinforcing problems developed. One was the reduction of the marshalling capacity of the key yards governing the gateways. The other was the disruption of marshalling in the dependencies to the south. The result was that the Ruhr’s capacity to ship coal and other goods was reduced. Simultaneously empty cars were immobilized in the areas around Frankfurt/Main and Mannheim. Without these empty cars, RBD Essen could not fully exploit even its re- duced marshalling capacity.  Typical of the situation in the Ruhr was the great marshalling yard at Hamm. It was struck seven times. On each occasion the repair crews, averaging about 200 Germans and additional contingents of foreigners, fought to restore the sorting grid. But the bombers always returned to spoil their work. By the end of October, this crucial nodal point was operating at only a quarter of capacity.42  Maximilian Lammertz, head of RBD Essen, badgered Berlin to send him more empty cars,41 but they never came. It was not that the DR lacked cars. The reverse was the case: the Reichsbahn suffered from a glut of freight cars.
