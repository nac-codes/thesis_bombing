At Speer’s orders, Pleiger transfered men from the coal mines, where they were redundant due to shipping difficulties, to teams repairing gas lines.51 Electrical service in the area also deteriorated sharply. But in this case there was no coal shortage. Numerous line cuts and the destruction by bombing of the major brown coal generating station at Goldenberg on 21 October were the culprits. A total of 80,000 kw were lost. Attempts to transfer power from Berlin and central Germany were impeded by the limited capacity of the grid and because BEWAG had no surplus coal. The results were major cuts to industries, including United Steel, and the breakdown of the area into a number of power islands.52 Car placings for brown coal in the region on the left bank of the Rhine fell by 70 percent due to its proximity to the front and the attacks on marshalling yards in Cologne.33 Brown coal production fell by half.54 The difference can be explained by the use of conveyor belts to carry brown coal from mines to many generating plants.  The shattering decline in coal supplies due to transportation bombing in the Ruhr bore dire implications for the region itself and its dependencies in central and southern Germany. Indirectly, it also placed an added burden on Upper Silesia and therefore influenced the economy of the entire Reich. Less directly affected by the coal famine was industry in the Ruhr itself. The iron and steel sector did suffer from a decline in fuel supplies but its main worry was the failure of its ore resources. Rohland of the RYE and United Steel and Hans-Giinther Sohl, also of VSt, subjected Ganzenmiiller, Dilli, and Schelp to a veritable blizzard of minatory letters on the subject. Sohl developed his own transportation plan calling for 4,300 car placings per day for domestic ore and 2,700 for scrap. Rohland warned Ganzenmiiller that “each ton of ore or scrap not shipped means an effective drop in production.”=>  The ZVL attempted to meet the industry’s demands b
