m its embargoes and even raised its priority above that of coal on 14 October. In addition, arrangements were made to ship 35,500 tons of steel shavings and splinters to the Ruhr monthly.£8 Ten days later, Schelp ordered that the full demand for car space for scrap be met.52 The Speer ministry weighed in by cancelling 204,700 tons of old iron plate orders.£2 The effort to relieve the burden on the steel industry and satisfy its needs, however, slowed and eventually came to a halt. Speer’s inspectors discovered that manufacturers still held stocks of 5 million tons of iron and steel. He prohibited new orders as a result and, following up the iron action of the summer, ordered an additional drastic reduction in holdings before new orders could be let.£1 He also decreed that iron stocks be reduced to the five-month level by the end of November 1944 by consumption and transfer to needy companies.£ In light of these ample supplies of semifinished iron and steel, the need for new production was limited and on 21 October Dilli restored coal to first priority.62 Schelp and Dilli visited the Ruhr on 28 October and prevailed upon Sohl to accept restrictions on movement within the region when the gateways were open. This would allow vital coal supplies to be rushed to the Ruhr’s dependencies. When the gateways were blocked, car space could be given to the steel industryS4  In retrospect, it is clear that the steel industry’s demands were not entirely justified. In addition to the rich supplies of unused steel in the yards of manufacturing companies, the iron and steel companies themselves were not on the brink of disaster due to a lack of iron ore. A very complex situation had developed in the Ruhr, composed of problems in distributing coal, direct damage to the a i ae Ganzenmiiller that “each ton of ore or scrap not shipped means an effective drop in production.”55 The ZVL attempted to meet the industry’s demands by organizing special runs to bring domestic ore to the region
