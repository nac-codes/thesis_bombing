t the discrepancy can be attributed to damage to production facilities in- flicted by bombing. But much of it must be ascribed to the iron and steel masters’ withdrawal of support from the Hitler regime. The complexity of the situation prevailing in the Ruhr steel industry can be clarified by one additional example. United Steel began to experience a coal shortage. Coal stocks at the mines of its GBAG subsidiary jumped by 1,000 percent and coke stocks were a fifth higher. Meanwhile, coal stocks at the mills were slightly lower and coke stocks one quarter lower than at the same time in 1943.62  The strain of constant air attacks, disputes, and searches for ‘ expedients le led to the 1e beginning c of the disintegration of Speer’s apparatus in the region.

Ruhr iron and steel production in October 1944 were
