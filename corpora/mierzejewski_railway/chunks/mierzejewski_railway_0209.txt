inished iron and steel, the need for new production was limited and on 21 October Dilli restored coal to first priority.62 Schelp demonstrates this. Ruhr iron and steel production in October 1944 were 36 percent and 28 percent lower respectively than during 1943.86 Ore stocks in the industry were 35 percent lower.£2 So real 34 percent. This husbanding of reserves caused a 39 percent drop in both iron and steel production.§8 The production loss did not correspond to the fall in ore supplies. Indeed, based on the rates of subsidiary jumped by 1,000 percent and coke stocks were a fifth higher. Meanwhile, coal stocks at the mills were slightly lower and coke stocks one quarter lower than at the same time in 1943.82 The strain of constant air attacks, disputes, and searches for expedients led to the beginning of the disintegration of Speer’s apparatus in the region. Coordinating components deliveries with final production became extremely difficult. The Ruhr Staff found cooperation among companies and with itself ever rarer. Even members of the Ruhr Staff and Speer’s transport plenipotentiaries were collapsing under the pressure. It cannot be surprising then that the Ruhr’s contribution to the Reich war effort in terms of finished goods fell sharply The final production of armaments was badly disrupted. Those goods that were completed often could not be shipped. Klockner shipped a fifth less in October than during the same month of the preceding year. The small Fritz Hulvershorn plant engaged in making heads for 80mm mortar shells was unable to ship any of the 30,000 that clogged its warehouse and grounds.?72 In short, transportation bombing—attacks on marshalling yards and canals—had substantially reduced the Ruhr’s iron, steel, and armaments production, gravely disrupted shipments of completed weapons, and upset the exchange of components with other regions. In addition, the Ruhr’s administrative apparatus was crumbling. Most importantly, the region’s key contribution
