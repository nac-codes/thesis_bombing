because the supply of locomotives simultaneously increased.82  The coal situation in the region was unstable. Brown coal production was steady in the East Elbian area farthest from the bombing, but in the Central German area it fell by 10 percent due to lack of car space from RBD Halle.88 The damage to the area’s synthetic fuel plants permitted the redisposition of their coal supplies. But hampered by scarce car space, this remedy was only partially effective.82  In the other major hard coal pivot, Upper Silesia, RBD Oppeln struggled against the paralysis infecting the region from the west, disruption from air attacks in its own region and the waves of dissolution sweeping westward before the advance of the Red Army Overall freight car placings declined here by 17 percent. More omninously, the all-important coal car placing figure dropped by 39 were confiscated and production losses were appearing even among armaments plants.22 At the Reichswerke Hermann Géring coal supplies were at the eight to ten day level by the end of October. Consequently, operation of the cokeries was reduced by up to two-thirds.82 Yet, reflecting the government’s direct control of this facility, production of iron increased 24.2 percent and that of finished Eastern Germany was also used to sustain the Reich economy during the Ruhr’s decline. The Reichsbahn and the Speer ministry alike used this ploy. The situation of GBL-East was far better than that The penalty was a decline in performance in the region. The backlog of trains more than doubled to 256 during the last week of October.85 In RBD Halle, freight car placings held steady but brown coal percent in October, compared to the average for the fourth quarter of 1943. Again the cause was confusion in marshalling for the number of locomotives in service increased.2° Hard coal production, measured on the same basis as car placings, fell by 18 percent in October. Coke production, especially valuable in light of the losses suffered in the Ruh
