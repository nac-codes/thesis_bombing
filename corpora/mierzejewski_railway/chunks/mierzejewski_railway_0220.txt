d coal production tumbled by 31 percent.112 The difference is explained by the consumption of stocks of coal and components. In this way assault gun output, easier to sustain than that of tanks due to its lower demand for steel, actually rose by a third from August.143 Output of the 88mm PAK 43 antitank gun was a fifth higher than in August and twice as high as during the previous October.114 But again the transport problem interposed itself. Many armaments firms were unable to ship their output and some were forced to curtail operations because their production areas were clogged with shipping crates.115 As we have seen, output of the 88mm PAK 43 rose substantially But acceptances by the army actually declined in October compared to August by 55 percent. The Army Armaments Office attributed the shortfall exclusively to “transportacion difficulties.”116 Considering that the Army was in dire need of every weapon that it could lay its hands on after the defeats of the summer of 1944. it is clear that transportation bombing was alreadv exerting a direct if far from decisive influence on the actual conibat power of the Wehrmacht. Bv late October 1944 again, the weakening of the DR was highlighted by the alarming increase in coal stocks at the mines by 176.5 percent and coke stocks by 720.5 percent.21 Coal production was reduced due to lack of it could be used. The Oberhiitten Gleiwitz complained as early as 27 September that it lacked car space to ship components graced with Hitler’s special “Panzerblitz” priority.4 placings were a staggering 39 percent lower in October. Brown coal car placings were 40 percent lower.103 The Main Car Office calculated in September, before the worst losses were sustained, that the the last ten days of October.195 Put differently, this meant that 307,000 cars were caught in backlogged trains and were therefore unavailable. A further 62,000 were delayed in loading and unloading because freight car turnaround time was up to 12.7 days in Octo
