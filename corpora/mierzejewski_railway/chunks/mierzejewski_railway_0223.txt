In this way assault gun output, easier to sustain than that of tanks due to its lower demand for steel, actually rose by a third from August.113 Output of the 88mm PAK 43 antitank gun was a fifth higher than in August and twice as high as during the The Army Armaments Office attributed the shortfall exclusively to “transportacion difficulties.”146 Considering that the Army was in dire need of every weapon that it could lay its hands on after the the transportation offensive.14Z The very clouds that intensified the attack concealed its results. They were also unanimous in pinpointing the lack of reliable ground sources.118 The Special Measures West instituted by the Reichsbahn in September were finally mentioned in RRS and SHAEF appreciations in early November. They concurred that this meant a reduction in the DR’s overall capability.U2 But RRS and MEW considered the DR to be moving the same volume of traffic as during the same period in 1943.120 SHAEF and OSS, based on prisoner interrogations, both argued that morale among the Reichsbahn train crews was sinking.12!
