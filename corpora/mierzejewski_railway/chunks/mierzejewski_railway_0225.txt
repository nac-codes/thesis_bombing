and the absence of new alternatives influenced the struggle over bombing strategy for the remainder of the war. The two most prominent alternatives were oil and transportation, and each had its advocates —EOU and Spaatz on the one hand and SHAEF and Tedder on the other. The ensuing debate over Tedder’s transportation proposal revolved around three issues. Its opponents contended that there was insufficient time for it to exert an appreciable effect. They emphasized the Reichsbahn’s ability to withstand an attack, and, finally, they purported that an economic collapse was about to occur due to the oil offensive. The first two objections were made in ignorance of the substantial weakening already suffered by the DR, and the latter was the product of the fundamental lack of comprehension of how energy was used in Germany that reigned at EOU.

The body was composed of representatives of MEW, RRS, EOU, the Air Ministry, USSTAF, and SHAEF.131 Tedder immediately realized that the board was loaded in favor of oil.132 Consequently, much to the chagrin of the CSTC which bitterly resisted his move, Tedder compelled it to form a transportation working committee on 25 October.123 This gambit can be interpreted as an attempt by Tedder not only to balance the committee but also to en- sure that the air commanders’ conferences retained the final policy-making and executive authority in the strategic bombing arena.  Having dealt with the CSTC, Tedder took the initiative behind the scenes and turned to Portal to argue his case. The support that Tedder enjoyed from Portal and Eisenhower was the decisive factor in his ability to prevail in the bureaucratic struggle that swirled in the Allied command. In a masterly summary of his position submitted to Portal on 25 October, he stated, in words that would have amazed Speer and Ganzenmiiller, “I a
