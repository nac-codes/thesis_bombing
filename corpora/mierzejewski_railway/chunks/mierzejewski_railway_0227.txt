These would be supported by fighter-bomber attacks on trains.126 Unlike his opponents, he viewed the oil and transportation offensives as “complementary.”122 But the crucial distinguishing feature about transportation and the reason it was not a “panacea” target, was that the Germans could not substitute for it. Tedder contended that a concerted attack on the Ruhr and Frankfurt/Main-Mannheim areas would “create complete economic chaos.”138 He hoped thereby significantly to smooth the path forward of the Allied armies and simultaneously to ruin the German economy. The combined pressure of all the air forces concentrating on a conceptually and geographically coherent target system and the armies’ continued attrition of the Wehrmacht would break Germany’s war fighting power.  Tedder was successful. On 28 October, SHAEF adopted his plan and the combined chiefs ratified it132 The new directive was issued on 1 November. It placed oil first and transportation second on the priority list with the same proviso concerning weather as under the special priority140 The CSTC was ordered to develop a comprehensive plan to meet Tedder s goals. It interpreted them as providing assistance to the land armies and putting “the greatest possible pressure on the enemy’s war production by interference with economic traffic.”141 The panel assumed that the war would  nanaleeda Ler thn and ALANA Neen nctirnitinn fae einen TV nbbaale eeeneeTd La Minibar nenintin wPantn fen Atle teen AL atta alen een a5 AN ent dn 2nd Thee nnnn cerned La fa ntaend inten thn taeene i VIALALIVOM BELLE PLCLALIU LL, LALULALIALIULL WAS OLIGLOM CLES, CELE VALIUM BLILILLES LLEOLYs DUE EELS LEOUULOM ULLLY 24d GELS PLALILE, 1IUE WUE OLIUELLIS, UL MUU A008L LIU 11d.
