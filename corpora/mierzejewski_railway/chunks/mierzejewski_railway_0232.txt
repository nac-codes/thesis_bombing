German economy. The key question now was whether the Allied air commanders could agree among themselves to continue the bombing and force its col- lapse.1 The Luftwaffe was too weak to oppose them. But haste, lack of information, and bureaucratic infighting could still have granted Speer and Ganzenmiiller the breathing space that they so desperately needed. During November the Allied air forces redoubled their attacks on the Reich’s transportation arteries. But on 5 December it appeared as if Speer’s hopes might be realized. On that day a meeting of Allied commanders took place at SHAEF to decide air strategy for the near future. Tedder advocated the continuation of transportation attacks designed to weaken the German economy. He was sup- ported by Spaatz and Lt. Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg, commander of the U.S. Ninth Air Force. But Gen. Omar Bradley, commander of the Twelfth Army Group, suggested that the heavy bombers be used to attack German defensive positions to ease the ground advance. In a crucial shift in the bureaucratic political situation, Eisenhower threw his support behind Bradley. The pressure from Washington for a quick end to the war was too great. Tedder lost the unstinting support of one of his major allies. The result was that oil retained first priority. Now carpet bombing to support the army moved into second place. Transportation attack was relegated to third. However, a significant proviso was attached to the new priority list. As before, oil targets would be hit only when visual conditions prevailed. To prevent a repetition of the tragedy that occurred in Normandy, where Allied troops were accidentally killed by heavy bombers, strikes supporting them also could be flown only during clear weather. Transportation raids could be flown under overcast conditions, using radar.2 Tedder did not suffer a complete defeat. Two factors continued to work in his favor. First, he continued to dominate the air commanders’ conferences. Therefore, he could still
