onditions, using radar.2 Tedder did not suffer a complete defeat. Two factors continued to work in his favor. First, he continued to dominate the air commanders’ conferences. Therefore, he could still exert heavy influence on target selection. Through this means, he ordered the CSTC to prepare a new transportation target priority list. It was completed on 8 December. First priority was given again to objectives such as  Page 121 of 282 44% marshalling yards and canals that would cause a long-term decline in transportation service. Second priority was accorded to yards and lines linking Hanover to Frankfurt/Main via Kassel, Giessen, Bebra, and Fulda. This new list pinpointed the gateways leading eastward and southward at their termini.3 The second factor helping Tedder was the weather. Throughout November and the first half of December heavy cloud blanketed western and central Europe. The result was that the deluge of explosives falling on transportation targets intensified. On 16 December 1944 the Wehrmacht crashed into the American lines in the Ardennes in a major counteroffensive. The Allies responded by redirecting their massive air forces to halt the German drive. The CSTC immediately prepared a new target list to guide the heavy bombers. It attempted to apply lessons that it learned from the bombing conducted prior to Overlord. First priority was given to bridges on six lines within an arc stretching from Cologne, east to Glessen, south to Hanau, south to Mannheim, and west to Saarbriicken. The purpose was to drive the Wehrmacht’s railheads back  at least across the Rhine. The second objective of the attacks was to destroy supplies in marshalling yards in and outside the bridge ring.4 Clearly the lessons learned by the CSTC differed from those drawm hv Tedder  Page 123 of 282 45% Bebra, and Fulda.
