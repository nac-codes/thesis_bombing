Throughout November and the first half at least across the Rhine. The second objective of the attacks was to destroy supplies in marshalling yards in and outside the bridge ring.4 Clearly the lessons learned by the CSTC differed from those drawn by Tedder. The consequence of these changes in strategic focus was that between 1 November and 15 December 1944, air attacks on transportation were scattered and target selection was inconsistent and did not fully exploit the geographical weaknesses of the Reichsbahn or the German economy. During the Ardennes phase, lasting from 16 December 1944 to the end of January 1945, it was more focused but still did not fully capitalize upon the geographical vulnerability of the transportation system. However, because of the sheer volume of explosives that was unleashed after weeks of severe bombing and the fact that the Reichsbahn was compelled to try to operate in the area most heavily attacked, the hail of blows was decisive. The onslaught unwittingly took advantage of the interdependence of the Reichsbahn system and overwhelmed it. Between the beginning of November 1944 and the end of January 1945 a total of 102,796 tons of bombs was dropped on transportation targets, primarily marshalling yards. The heaviest month was December 1944 when 45,818 tons smothered yards, lines, and bridges. The biggest contributor during the entire period was the Eighth Air Force, which accounted for 55 percent of the total.4  When the first transportation plan was implemented early in November, the inland waterway system was still reeling from the sledgehammer blows landed during September and October. The new wave of attacks that followed virtually eliminated it as a useful economic resource. The bombers were assisted by the onset of ice toward the end of December.  The Dortmund-Em
