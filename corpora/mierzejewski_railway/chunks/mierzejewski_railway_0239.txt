canals, attempts were made to bypass the Rhine bridge barriers using the Reichsbahn.22 But by the end of December the RWKS was again distributing coal locally.21 From 14 October to 31 December only 550,000 tons of coal passed Cologne, or only about 14 percent of normal traffic.22 The impact of this drastic reduction can be gauged by examining coal shipments from Duisburg. Movement southward was so irregular that the coal loading target for the port was abandoned during the first week of December.22 Compared to the monthly average for the fourth quarter of 1943, coal traffic from Duisburg fell by 73 percent in December and early January.24  Just nine attacks on western Germany’s waterways prevented the Ruhr from shipping coal to its dependencies by water by mid-January 1945. All of the region’s canal and river connections with central, southern, and northern Germany were severed.25 One of the vital props of the division of labor had been knocked away. Only the Reichsbahn remained to support the regional interdependence of the Reich industries. But it too had been battered by the Allied air forces.  Prior to the Ardennes offensive, the coal gateways were not attacked systematically. The Hohenbudberg route was struck twice at Cologne and was strafed heavily by the Ninth Air Force.

The Soest gateway was struck twice at its source and twice at the Altenbecken Viaduct. The Geisecke gateway was bombed only once, at Kassel. An area raid disrupted operations at Vorhalle and Hagen, Gl
