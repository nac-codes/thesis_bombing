d havoc on the Rhine. In late December the Autobahn Bridge and the South Bridge south of the ruins of the Cologne-Miilheimer Bridge sagged close to the water gateway leading north through Minster: two at the source, three against Osnabriick, and one each against Wanne-Eickel and Essen, both of which sent coal along the route. Overall 150 transportation priority lists. From the beginning of November to the end of January only 5 3 percent of the total bomb tonnage dropped on transportation targets was directed against those recommended by the CSTC. Moreover, 96 percent was dropped using radar.2& Nevertheless, the impact on the Reichsbahn was shattering. The DR doggedly attempted 1:0 run trains south from the Ruhr to the Frankfurt/Main and Mannheim areas. It could not do otherwise. At all costs these regions had to be supplied with coal and components and their products distributed. It was also compelled to support the panzer divisions in the Eifel. For example, in December, RBD Cologne directly behind the area of the counterthrust devoted a quarter of its freight car space to moving Wehrmacht supplies. During the summer it had used only 12 percent for this purpose. The Vorhalle gateway was given over completely to Wehrmacht traffic: 1,400 trains were used to support the preparations for the drive alone.22 The hinterland of the Bulge was like a siphon draining away the lifeblood of the Reichsbahn. But there was nothing that it could do to stanch the flow. The result of these two series of attacks was the debilitation of the entire system. There can be no doubt that a concerted, consistent assault on the gateways combined with attacks on RBD Halle and Oppeln would have precipitated the collapse of the Reichsbahn very quickly and brought the entire German economv tumbling down after it. But the campaign that was waged was sufficient to achieve almost the same result. albeit more slowlv.  Page 128 of 282 46% economy tumbling down after it. But the campaign that was waged
