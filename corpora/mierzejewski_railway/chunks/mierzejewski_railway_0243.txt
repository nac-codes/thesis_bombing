with an attack on 2 November. On 29 November it slashed the artery again for eleven days. Attacks on 26 November 1944 and 17 January 1945 failed. RBD Hanover took energetic measures to restore service immediately after the first raid. The OT was brought in and the local Zublin construction firm was also contracted to accomplish some of the work. No permanent repairs were attemptedâ€”only temporary bridging of cuts. After the second successful raid, many of the piers settled, causing the track bed to buckle. Nevertheless, only the breaks were closed and traffic resumed. After the 29 November attack, a single track bypass line was begun. But difficulty in bringing up repair materials, disputes between Zublin and the OT, inadequate accommodations for the laborers, which led many to desert, and strafing by Allied fighters delayed the repair work and pre vented completion of the  Lee 20 bypass.22 The Altenbecken Viaduct near Paderborn was located on the double-tracked Soest-Halle gateway and bore a weight of freight traffic second only to that at Bielefeld. The sandstone and brick structure was 480 meters long and 33 meters high. The Reichsbahn rerouting plan provided for detours north to Hanover and the Hamm gateway at Lohne north of Bielefeld and south to Kassel and Giessen on the Vorhalle gateway. The Eighth Air Force landed a shattering blow to this artery on 26 November, completely halting traffic. The hammer fell again on 29 November. No train passed at Altenbecken until II February 1945. Six hundred foreigners were committed to the repair effort, and miners arrived from Hamm to assist. Day and night shifts were laid on. Here too a bypass was begun. But cold weather, confusion, and strafing greatly hindered the work, and it was never completed.32 Page 129 of 282 47% Air attacks also rocked marshalling yards serving the coal gateways. By 7 November, Hamm, Bochum, Osnabriick, and Miinster were shut. Three marshalling yards in Cologne were closed, as were two in Essen.
