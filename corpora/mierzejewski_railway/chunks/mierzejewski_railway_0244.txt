attacks also rocked marshalling yards serving the coal gateways. By 7 November, Hamm, Bochum, Osnabriick, and Miinster were shut. Three marshalling yards in Cologne were closed, as were two in Essen. Forty-six others operated at reduced levels.21 Of twenty-nine major freight-loading yards in GBL-West, fourteen were shut, eight operated at reduced levels, and only seven functioned normally.32 In early November all marshalling work at Hamm was abandoned.23 More typical was the situation at Diisseldorf-Derendorf on the Wedau gateway. Repeated attacks gradually reduced the yard’s marshalling capacity and finally rendered it almost useless. A raid on 2 November stopped all marshalling by damaging the sorting groups and switches. OT, Wehrmacht, and foreign contin- gents were thrown into the repair effort. On 29 November the hump and again the sorting groups were damaged. But the repair crews tenaciously fought back. Marshalling had been partially restored when, on 7 January 1945, the sorting group was shut down by twenty-five hits. Numerous other tracks were cut and the telephone system failed. A street bridge passing over the yard collapsed, halting all through traffic. An additional 1,300 laborers drawn from the Wehrmacht, private industry, and contractors were committed in a desperate effort to restore service. Operations resumed at a reduced level within a week. But the bombers were not finished. The Eighth Air Force blasted the yard again on 23 January. Marshalling continued but the capacity of the yard had been badly eroded.34 During December, freight car placings were 80 percent below the fourth quarter 1943 monthly average. Contrary to Tedder’s expectations, no locomotive shortage developed at Derendorf despite damage to the sheds. Indeed the yard had more locomotives available in December, fifty-seven, than at any time previously. In January the number of serviceable locomotives increased to sixty but car placings fell to a mere 10 percent of normal.35  The patt
