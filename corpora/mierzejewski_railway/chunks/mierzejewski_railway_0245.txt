In January the number of serviceable locomotives increased to sixty but car placings fell to a mere 10 percent of normal.35  The pattern that emerged at Hamm and Diisseldorf-Derendorf was repeated at the other marshalling yards serving the Ruhr. Through passages were rarely stopped. But sorting freight cars and forming trains became extremely difficult. Coordination among yards was ruined, and unless the damage could be made good, a drastic additional reduction in coal and general freight movement would result. At Hamm and Derendorf the repair crews lost this battle. Similar defeats were suffered at numerous yards throughout the Ruhr despite energetic, even desperate efforts by the Reichs-  hhahn and tha Cnaar minictry  Page 130 of 282 47% weather, confusion, and strafing greatly hindered the work, and it was never completed.3® fell to a mere 10 percent of normal.3% bahn and the Speer ministry.

A tenth of the Ruhr’s coal miners were held ready to intervene, and the Gauleiters were empowered to commandeer industrial labor to help the Reichsbahn.32 By 13 November, 95.000 people had been dragooned into the battle to reopen marshalling yards and bridges.38 On 29 November, Hitler ordered that 150,000 laborers from elsewhere in the Reich be sent to the embattled Ruhr to lend their weight to the repair effort.22 The Ruhr Staff collected 4,000 tractors to haul earth at work sites and to move freight around blockages.42 On 30 November, 10,400 men were at work on the Hamm gateway line alone.4! The Wehrmacht stepped in on the following day with 40,000 specialists in bridge, electrical, and telephone work.42 In a move fraught with dangers in
