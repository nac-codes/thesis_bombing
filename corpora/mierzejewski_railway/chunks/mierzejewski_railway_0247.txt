Therefore the DR and the Speer ministry were compelled to take new steps to ensure that what car space remained was used most wisely and to reduce the demand for it. On 25 November the RVM ordered RBD Essen drastically to reduce car placings for general freight so as to release space for coal. Cuts would be made until a minimum of 11,000 units were placed for coal daily.46 This was only half of the Ruhr’s usual hard coal car target. The RWKS ordered all of its subsidiaries to strain every nerve to ensure that the Reichsbahn locomotives obtained sufficient coal.42 On 29 November, Lammertz cut car placings for general freight by an additional 2,000 cars per day to free space. He warned Berlin that further cuts would cause a reduction in industrial activity by disrupting component deliveries.48 Berlin attempted to help by slashing car placings for freight other than coal in Upper Silesia so that the eastern pivot could relieve the Ruhr of more of its burden.42 RBD Oppeln was ordered to increase coal car placings to compensate for RBD Essen’s setbacks.52 Berlin also imposed severe embargoes on freight shipments to RBD Essen that excluded all but Wehrmacht goods and the most important semifinished products.21 On 20 December each of the three GBLs was given a quota of cars that they could send ta RRND Fssen each dav hearing freisht not an the nriority list Tn all 810 cars were allowed under this disnensation in addition ta the 143 trains scheduled ta carry nriority freight 52 The  Page 131 of 282 48% normally.32 In early November all marshalling work at Hamm was abandoned.32 More typical was the situation at Diisseldorf
