Bulge. In late January the bombers returned. In the east the Red Army burst into Upper Silesia. Immediately, locomotive coal was restored to first priority. 54 Speer restricted the demand for coal by establishing consumption priorities. On 11 November, through Central Planning, he granted the Reichsbahn itself first priority, followed by shipping and gas plants. A month later the priorities were refined. Locomotives and ships shared first priority and were to get full supplies. Next came waterworks at full supplies and gasworks at 70 percent. In third place, receiving three-quarters of their usual consumption, were the electric utilities. Next, homes received half of their usual supplies. Finally, armaments plants that burned coal would be given enough only to complete weapons. On 25 January 1945 homes were denied all hard coal supplies in order to permit shipments to powder, liquid fuel, and munitions plants.55  The disruption of transportation in the Rhine-Ruhr area also forced the RMfRuK to impose revised restrictions on the supply of brown coal. In this case, dependencies of the RWKS that could no longer be supplied with hard coal were to be provided with an equivalent amount of brown coal first. Then utilities would receive 70 percent of their needs, followed by food processing plants, which would also obtain 70 percent of their requirements. Homes came next but were permitted only a quarter of their needs. Then came selected armaments plants with full supplies. All other industries would receive nothing.2&  The RVM also attempted to simplify the control of traffic in the Ruhr. The various directorates and the RWKS had long chafed under the administration of Sarter and GBL-West.
