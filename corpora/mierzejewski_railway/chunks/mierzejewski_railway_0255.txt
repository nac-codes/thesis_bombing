on improved a bit by late January. Then about 90 train pairs could operate.£2 The volume of freight traffic, despite the in service increased also from 755 to 807.64 But the number stored cold for lack of fuel jumped to 33 at the end of January 1945 compared to just one at the same time in 1944.65 Locomotives were directorates that were dependent upon the Ruhr for coal. During November, instead of the 20 service coal trains per day needed to supply these regions, an average of just 7 left RBD Essen.£6 Despite every effort the situation did not improve.S2 The Reichsbahn was driven to confiscating coal to keep its locomotives running.£8 This, combined with the disruption of marshalling in GBL-South, pre- Lammertz recognized the difficulty. His lines were open but he could not use them. On 14 November he begged the ZVL for empty cars.62 Even before Lammertz’s appeal, Berlin attempted to relieve effort.22 The surge occurred on 15 November. On 29 November, Berlin ordered that the highest priority be given to sending open cars to the Ruhr.Z2 Still RBD Essen lacked empty cars. The situation became so desperate that Lammertz ordered that freight simply be dumped from backed-up cars to free them to carry coal. Any semblance of orderly deliveries or notification of addressees was abandoned.@ By any means the backlog simply had to be reduced. As of 29 December 1944, 450 trains were backlogged in GBL-West.24 Many were coal trains. All tied up valuable cars and locomotives and clogged marshalling yards and even open lines. The critical difficulty, the other major component of the problem, was bringing open cars to RBD Essen from the areas of RBDs Frankfurt/Main, Mainz, Karlsruhe, and Stuttgart. These embattled regions in GBL-West and GBL-South were a sump drawing cars away from the Ruhr just as France had during the spring and summer of 1944. Bringing the cars to RBD Essen was just the beginning. Once there, they would have to be formed into trains. Using unit trains would ease
