Losses in one area could not be made good in others.78 There was too much damage to too many but so were the psychological ones.82 The RWKS in particular took energetic steps to adapt to the new circumstances. On 18 November, with the utmost reluctance, it abandoned all efforts to allocate car space to mines centrally and established three dispersed command centers on the edges of the Ruhr.Â£! At the end of December it made arrangements independently from the government with the Upper Silesian Hard Coal Syndicate to direct coal relief trains from the east to the RWKS regional branches. The syndicate trading companies themselves were empowered to negotiate the scheduling of coal trains directly with the Upper Silesian syndicate.82 This devolution of authority contributed to a loss of control. Reports increased in January 1945 that RWKS coal shipments were being pir- ated. In one case, a train destined for the Opel plant in Riisselsheim was commandeered by the local Gauleiter.83 Friction also increased between the Reichsbahn and the steel industry. At a meeting in Essen held on 17 November, Rohland imperiously demanded more car space for his branch of industry Ganzenmiiller sharply rejected this and proceeded to lecture the steel leader on how his industiy could use unit trains more effectively and conserve and store coal.84  The net result of the decline in both rail and waterway traffic and the disintegration of management cooperation was an industrial disaster in the Ruhr and a major economic calamity for the Reich as a whole. In the Ruhr itself, hard coal production in November and December 1944 was only half of the monthly average for the fourth quarter of the preceding ye ar. In January 1945 output improved only marginally. Hard coal cut in Upper Silesia declined by about a fifth in November and December. Then it plummetted to less
