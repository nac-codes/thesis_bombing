Then it plummetted to less than half of normal in January due to the arrival of the Red Army. The result was an overall decline in Reich hard coal production of 40 percent in November and December 1944 and a massive 48 percent in January 1945. Overall production was 29.4 million tons lower than during the same three months of the preceding year. Only about a tenth of the decline can be attributed to the loss of territory such as Aachen and the Saar.

On 18 November, with the utmost reluctance, it abandoned all efforts to allocate car space to mines centrally and established three dispersed command centers on the edges of the Ruhr.8! At the end of December it made arrangements independently from the government with the 15.6 percent of the total loss in coal production, virtually all sustained in January. Fully 53.8 percent of the hard coal production loss was
