arrangements independently from the government with the 15.6 percent of the total loss in coal production, virtually all sustained in January. Fully 53.8 percent of the hard coal production loss was suffered in the Ruhr. This came about solely through the dis- ruption of transportation.85  Looked at from the perspective of actual deliveries, the enormity of the disaster comes into focus more clearly. Between August 1944 and January 1945, the Reichsbahn and the inland waterways delivered 36.5 million tons of hard coal less than during the same period in 1943.86 The Reichsbahn alone accounted for 89 percent of the deficit. The equivalent of six weeks of production had been lost. Since factories rarely held more than four to six weeks’ reserves, transportation bombing had eliminated the national stock of hard coal. Even if the mines had produced more coal it could not have been delivered. Here again an examination of the situation in the two main hard coal producing regions provides telling confirmation of the effectiveness of transportation bombing. In the Ruhr stocks of coal at the pit heads skyrocketed to 157.4 percent above normal in December 1944. Reich hard coal stocks, undelivered, still at the mines, were no.7 percent above normal. Of the overall undelivered hard coal stock, 42 percent clogged the Ruhr mine yards.82 Coal production was reduced because coal could not be delivered. The problem was most severe in the Ruhr where transportation bombing had been heaviest and most effective. Upper Silesia was unable to compensate because of the spread of confusion to it from the west and because of the advance of the Red Army. The same phenomenon affected coke supplies. In this case, though, the implications were even more severe because of the Ruhr’s heavy domination of the German coke market. Ruhr coke output by December 1944 was 55 percent of the fourth-quarter 1943 monthly average and in January 1945, 54 percent of the first-quarter 1944 monthly average. Reich co
