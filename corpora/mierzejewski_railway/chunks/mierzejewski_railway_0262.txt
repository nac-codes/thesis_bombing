the German coke market. Ruhr coke output by December 1944 was 55 percent of the fourth-quarter 1943 monthly average and in January 1945, 54 percent of the first-quarter 1944 monthly average. Reich coke production in the same months was 53 and 51 percent lower than usual.88 Of the total loss of coke production to the Reich, 73 percent was sustained in the Ruhr, the equivalent of four and a half weeks of national output. Part of the cause was the damage to cokeries due to bombing.82 But the overwhelming factor was the Reichsbahn’s inability to ship their meager production. In December 1944, coke stocks in the Ruhr were 446.9 percent above normal. Indeed, at 2,649,000 tons they equalled over a month’s normal production.22 The hemorrhage in the Ruhr comprised 82 percent of the national total of unshipped coke. Again, transportation bombing, the disruption of marshalling in RBD Essen and associated directorates, and the cutting of the Ruhr’s major waterways were decisive in preventing the Ruhr from shipping fuel to its dependencies. The losses sustained there far outweighed the the loss of Aachen, the Saar, and Upper Silesia. In the latter case, the damage was suffered too late to influence industrial production during the period from November 1944 to January 1945.  The only alternative energy source, brown coal, suffered a lesser though still severe decline. Here the greatest losses were sustained in the Rhenish area near Cologne, and the cause was the disruption of transport on the Rhine and the Reichsbahn. Brown coal production in the area was only a quarter of normal throughout the period. Reich output fell by about a quarter,21 and 83 percent of the decline was sustained in the Rhenish region.  In the face of such crushing losses there was little that the government could do. Beyond the measures that it took to conserve energy, outlined above, it resorted to other anemic expedients.
