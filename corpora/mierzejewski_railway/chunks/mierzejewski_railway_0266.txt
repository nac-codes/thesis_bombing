Hard Coal Syndicate. In November it sent 475,289 tons of coal to RWKS customers from Kiel to Mannheim.%3 In December it dispatched 520,000 tons. But this was only three-quarters of not be satisfied.1 As he put it on 14 November, “It is in no way a production, rather only and exclusively a transportation problem.”10! For all of this he remained preoccupied with preserving the tion of the unified management apparatus that Speer was still struggling to preserve. In one very critical respect, Schmidt’s forebodings were completely justified. The disruption of transportation and the resulting coal famine fatally weakened Ruhr industry. Coal and coke supplies to the region’s gasworks fell sharply. In addition air attacks destroyed major plants at Duisburg, Hamborn, and Gelsenkirchen. The result of this combination of factors was the decline in gas output in the region by three-quarters by the end of January.193 The electricity situation was somewhat better. Cuts in production of 30 percent were begun in early December to conserve coal, and demand had fallen by half due to bomb damage to factories.1% Nevertheless, by the end of December three major generating plants, Reisholz, Werdohl, and Gevelsburg, had closed due to lack of coal.195 Speer at- tempted to use the national grid to feed electricity into the Ruhr, but coal shortages at the generating plants in central Germany prevented it 106 The Ruhr’s second major industry, iron and steel, was also badly hurt by the transportation offensive. In December, ore arrivals at the smelters were 80 percent lower than a year before. Even domestic ores were affected: arrivals were down 85 percent.102 Ore stocks at the smelters fell by 44 percent in November.128 As in the case of hard coal and coke production, the losses suffered in the Rhenish-Westphalian iron and steel industry marked the decisive break in Reich production of these commodities. By January 1945, Ruhr raw iron production was 64 percent lower than the monthly average
