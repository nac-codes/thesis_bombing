Rhenish-Westphalian iron and steel industry marked the decisive break in Reich production of these commodities. By January 1945, Ruhr raw iron production was 64 percent lower than the monthly average for the same quarter during the previous year. Reich output was 73 percent lower. The Ruhr accounted for 42 percent of the loss, central Germany for 14 percent, and Upper Silesia for only 3 percent. The balance is accounted for by the loss of Saar production.102 The same phenomenon appeared in steel making: by January 1945, as measured against the monthly average for the first quarter of 1944, Reich production had fallen by two-thirds. Ruhr output in January was 66 percent in arrears and accounted for 47 percent of the loss in steel production for the period November 1944 to Jan- uary 1 aad 110 Scrap supplies followed the same path.111  Page 141 of 282 51% synthetic fuel plant proved impossible.

Cuts in production of 30 percent were begun in early December to conserve coal, and demand had fallen by half due to bomb damage to factories.1% Nevertheless, by the end of December three major generating plants, Reisholz, Werdohl, and Gevelsburg, had closed due to lack of coal.105 Speer at- domestic ores were affected: arrivals were down 85 percent.122 Ore stocks at the smelters fell by 44 percent in November.128 As in the case of hard coal and coke production, the losses suffered in the percent. The balance is accounted for by the loss of Saar production.122 The same phenomenon appeared in steel making: by January 1945, as measured against the monthly average for the first quarter uary 1945.110 Scrap supplies foll
