prior year’s consumption for the larger programs.112 This by itself is a clear indication that elasticity of sup- ply had been exhausted at the level of capital goods production. But losses extended far beyond this sector.  In the Ruhr the failure of energy and component supplies caused a major loss of finished armaments production. Most programs failed to meet their targets. Completed items frequently sat in warehouses because the Reichsbahn could not take them away to the users.113 In the Diisseldorf area, 20,000 freight cars were backed up at factory sidings, loaded with completed armaments.114 Overall, 800,000 tons of iron and steel products rusted away in the Ruhr awaiting transport in mid-January 1945.115 The Gau Economics Office in Diisseldorf concluded as early as 18 November 1944 that: “Under current transportation conditions it would be sensible to consider the ability to ship freight as the fundamental scale for the control of energy and labor utilization.” GBL-East considered the Ruhr isolated by early December.11Z On 17 January 1945, Schmidt moaned that all of the gateways and waterways leading from the Ruhr had been slammed shut by the bombers.118 The Speer ministry, in a memorandum completed on the next day, concluded that the Ruhr existed as a traffic island isolated from its dependencies.112 By late December 1944 or early January 1945 the Allied bombers had torn awav the heart of the Reich division of labor.

The Ruhr itself suffered a maior decline in armaments out-  Page 142 of 282 52% STLUVEIIICIILG MUS LU Gil ditto. 1 IE LULAPOS Ul LOLCPILULIS AIIM LELCBLAPLL CEL VILE LAUMSEU UY ELIS LAIMS 1LELIUOL OU CUULULIALIUIL ALILUIIE, LILO OY TIUUILALE © ALLIES AIIM LEGUAIE CULIPaliito, Wilil Lo CUOlUrIeis all not be satisfied.122 As he put it on 14 November, “It is in no way a production, rather only and exclusively a transportation problem.”1®!
