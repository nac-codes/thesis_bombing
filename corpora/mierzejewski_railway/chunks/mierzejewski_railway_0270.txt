For all of this he remained preoccupied with preserving the fallen by half due to bomb damage to factories.1% Nevertheless, by the end of December three major generating plants, Reisholz, Werdohl, and Gevelsburg, had closed due to lack of coal.195 Speer at- tempted to use the national grid to feed electricity into the Ruhr, but coal shortages at the generating plants in central Germany prevented it.126 domestic ores were affected: arrivals were down 85 percent.10Z Ore stocks at the smelters fell by 44 percent in November.128 As in the case of hard coal and coke production, the losses suffered in the uary 1945.110 Scrap supplies followed the same path.111 warehouses because the Reichsbahn could not take them away to the users.143 In the Diisseldorf area, 20,000 freight cars were backed up at factory sidings, loaded with completed armaments.14 considered the Ruhr isolated by early December.1Z On 17 January 1945, Schmidt moaned that all of the gateways and waterways leading from the Ruhr had been slammed shut by the bombers.118 The Allied bombers had torn away the heart of the Reich division of labor. The result was a decisive drop in the nation’s coal and steel production. The Ruhr itself suffered a major decline in armaments out- put.

At Mannheim, coal arrivals on the Rhine virtually halted in November and were 77 percent below normal in January.122 The Reichsbahn could not compensate. GBL-South had been thoroughly disorganized by bombing in its western areas. Car placings at the major marshalling yards at Stuttgart-Kornwestheim, Mannheim, and Karlsruhe sank drastically. The other GBLs frequently refused trains from GBL-South, contributing to congestion in its yards.121 By mid-November a car surplus of enormous proportions had de
