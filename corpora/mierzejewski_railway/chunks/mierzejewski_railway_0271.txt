nheim, and Karlsruhe sank drastically. The other GBLs frequently refused trains from GBL-South, contributing to congestion in its yards.121 By mid-November a car surplus of enormous proportions had developed. By the first week of January 1945 all available space for stor- ing cars was exhausted.122 Air attacks had shut down Stuttgart-Kornwestheim and Mannheim a week before.423 Telephone communications collapsed. GBL headquarters lost contact with the ports and its major marshalling yards along the Rhine and the locomotive sheds.124 Headquarters itself was bombed out and forced to transfer from Munich to Freising. Scheduled, controlled movement was impossible.125 The coal famine struck with devastating force. In early November, locomotive coal stocks stood at only nine and a half days. By mid-December they had disappeared.126 Here again, the region by three-quarters by the end or January.-~- 1 he electricity situation was somewnat better. Cuts 1n production of 50 percent were begun 1n early December to conserve coal, and demand nad fallen by half due to bomb damage to factories.194 Nevertheless, by the end of December three major generating plants, Reisholz, Werdohl, and Gevelsburg, had closed due to lack of coal.195 Speer at- tempted to use the national grid to feed electricity into the Ruhr, but coal shortages at the generating plants in central Germany prevented it.106 uary 1945.41 Scrap supplies followed the same path. Overall, 800,000 tons of iron and steel products rusted away in the Ruhr awaiting transport in mid-January 1945.15 The Gau Economics Office in Diisseldorf concluded as early as 18 November 1944 that: “Under current transportation conditions it would be sensible to consider the ability to ship freight as the fundamental scale for the control of energy and labor utilization.”116 GBL-East considered the Ruhr isolated by early December.112 On 17 January 1945, Schmidt moaned that all of the gateways and waterways leading from the Ruhr had been slammed s
