collapsed. GBL headquarters lost contact with the ports logged in RBDs Stuttgart and Karlsruhe to recipients that it determined in the east.122 Yet by mid-January 1945, the backlog in GBL-South had mounted to 606 trains.132 Domestic ore stocks -27.22% GBAG coal stocks +831.32% GBAG coke stocks +1,308.34% Sources: VSt, “Jahresbericht,” Vertraulich, pp. 2-4; “Eildienst, “December 1944, p. 4, NA RG 243, 3(a)37.  Under these circumstances orderly economic activity in the central Rhenish industrial region was impossible. A brutal coal famine depressed the economic life of the area. Coal supplies to industry were off by two-thirds. Electricity demand had fallen by three-quarters. Yet coal stocks at the generating plants were exhausted.3! Of twenty-four firms on the left bank of the Rhine monitored by the Armaments Command Ludwigshafen, by January 1945 eight were badly short of coal and eight others were completely closed down due to lack of fuel.132 In the same area the disruption of passenger train service, caused in part by the cancellation of runs to conserve locomotive coal, prevented workers from coming to the factories and caused some plants to shut down. Arrivals of components were rare and erratic. Some 7,991 tons of completed armaments clogged the warehouses and storage yards of the city’s factories.133 At the Giulini aluminum plant 4,700 tons of semifinished aluminum could not be shipped.134 Across the Rhine in Mannheim, the Brown, Boveri et Cie. electrical equipment manufacturing company shipped 80 percent fewer transformers in January 1945 than it did monthly in the first quarter of 1944, despite still being able to produce them.125 The transportation-induced paralysis spread farther afield. Both Opel in Riisselsheim and BMW in Munich closed due to lack of coal.136  The situation was the same in central Germany. A major attempt was made to ship coal to the Reichswerke Hermann Goring by barge, using the Elbe and the long bypass around the Ladbergen and Gravenh
