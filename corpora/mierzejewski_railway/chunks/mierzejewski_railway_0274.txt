36  The situation was the same in central Germany. A major attempt was made to ship coal to the Reichswerke Hermann Goring by barge, using the Elbe and the long bypass around the Ladbergen and Gravenhorst obstacles.132 But the effort on the Elbe was stultified both by confusion and by a lack of coal to propel the barges.138 During December, coal shipments on the river declined.122 Only a trickle  Page 145 of 282 53% considered the Ruhr isolated by early December.+42 On 17 January 1945, Schmidt moaned that all of the gateways and waterways leading from the Ruhr had been slammed shut by the bombers.118 The logged in RBDs Stuttgart and Karlsruhe to recipients that it determined in the east.122 Yet by mid-January 1945, the backlog in GBL-South had mounted to 606 trains.122 Armaments Command Ludwigshafen, by January 1945 eight were badly short of coal and eight others were completely closed down due to lack of fuel.122 In the same area the disruption of passenger slipped past Minden.142 Unlike the Ruhr industries, the RWHG was completely under the control of the regime and therefore could not cut production to conserve coal. Pleiger drove his plant in an attempt to compensate for the setbacks suffered in the west. By early November, coal stocks had fallen by two-thirds to twelve days.141 On 2 December, Pleiger deliberately subverted the government coal-rationing program and ordered the confiscation of eight barges bound for Berlin to feed his plant. He also ordered the Saxon Hard Coal Syndicate to step up its shipments to the RWHG.142 But coal deliveries to Salzgitter continued to sink. In November 1944 they were 42 percent below normal. Consumption was virtually unchanged. Deliveries remained dismal in December and Januaryâ€”41 percent lower than usual. In December coal stocks were 60 percent below the monthly average for the fourth quarter of 1943. That proved decisive, for in January consumption was finally slashed by 47 percent.143 Pig iron production tumbled in the sa
