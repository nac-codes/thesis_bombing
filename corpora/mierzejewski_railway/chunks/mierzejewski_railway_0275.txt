s were 60 percent below the monthly average for the fourth quarter of 1943. That proved decisive, for in January consumption was finally slashed by 47 percent.143 Pig iron production tumbled in the same month by 67 percent.144 Semifinished steel output dropped by half.145 Gas production fell 61 percent with dire consequences not only for the RWHG itself, but also for industries in the region dependent on it.146 Electricity production fell sooner. In November it dropped to about half of usual and remained there or somewhat above through January. But sales to users outside the plant were cut by as much as 60 percent.142 The combination of failing coal supplies, which forced reductions at the RWHG and other generating plants in central at 1 — Datta — Detar eta et teeta al rel, ert eee rare and erratic. Some 7,991 tons of completed armaments clogged the warehouses and storage yards of the city’s factories.132 At the Giulini aluminum plant 4,700 tons of semifinished aluminum could not be shipped.124 Across the Rhine in Mannheim, the Brown, Boveri et Cie. electrical equipment manufacturing company shipped 80 percent fewer transformers in January 1945 than it did Gravenhorst obstacles.122 But the effort on the Elbe was stultified both by confusion and by a lack of coal to propel the barges.138 During December, coal shipments on the river declined.122 Only a trickle Germany, and cold weather, which restricted hydroelectric production, forced the Planning Office to order armaments firms to close one day each week to conserve electricity148 An example of how transportation bombing reduced armaments final production in central Germany is provided by the Krupp-Gruson plant at Magdeburg. The failure of gas supplies from the RWHG, the collapse of coal deliveries to Gruson itself, and the disruption of components deliveries from Vomag and Nibelungen caused MK IV tank output to decline by 43 percent in January 1945 compared to the first quarter 1944 monthly average.142  Mediating b
