the disruption of components deliveries from Vomag and Nibelungen caused MK IV tank output to decline by 43 percent in January 1945 compared to the first quarter 1944 monthly average.142  Mediating between central Germany and its sources of energy and markets to the west and east was RBD Halle. This pivotal directorate struggled to maintain the flow of traffic. But the chaos in the west infected it. The inability to move trains to the bomb-ravaged areas, the disruption of communications, and confusion caused by air raids at the nearby synthetic fuel plants caused a decline in marshalling performance. During the period of the first transportation plan, RBD Halle actually increased car placings by 1.5 percent. But after 16 December they fell steadily. During the Ardennes offensive, which lasted until the end of January 1945, car placings in RBD Halle were 19.6 percent below the level of performance achieved during the same period of the preceding year.152 The region, as we have seen, was used by the Speer ministry to substitute brown coal for the losses in hard coal supplies sustained in the Ruhr. Reflecting this, brown coal car placings in RBD Halle rose in November and December 1944 by 7.5 and 5.5 percent respectively compared to the monthly average attained during the fourth quarter of 1943. But in January 1945 they were 11.9 percent lower than the first quarter 1944 monthly average.15! The disruption of marshalling denied the German economy even this inadequate substitute. RBD Halleâ€™s role as mediator between west, north, and east also declined. The number of freight trains passing through the region between the beginning of November and the end of January fell by 28.5 percent.152 By mid-January eighty-three trains were backed up in the  area 153  Page 146 of 282 53% were off by two-thirds. Electricity demand had fallen by three-quarters. Yet coal stocks at the generating plants were exhausted. Of twenty-four firms on the left bank of the Rhine monitored by the A
