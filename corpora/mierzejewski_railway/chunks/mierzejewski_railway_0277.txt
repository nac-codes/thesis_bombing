were off by two-thirds. Electricity demand had fallen by three-quarters. Yet coal stocks at the generating plants were exhausted. Of twenty-four firms on the left bank of the Rhine monitored by the Armaments Command Ludwigshafen, by January 1945 eight were badly short of coal and eight others were completely closed down due to lack of fuel.122 In the same area the disruption of passenger rare and erratic. Some 7,991 tons of completed armaments clogged the warehouses and storage yards of the city’s factories.123 At the Giulini aluminum plant 4,700 tons of semifinished aluminum offensive, which lasted until the end of January 1945, car placings in RBD Halle were 19.6 percent below the level of performance achieved during the same period of the preceding year.150 The region, area.153 Operations in the other great hard coal pivot, RBD Oppeln, also deteriorated, though for different reasons. Here the culprits were the spreading confusion from the west, incidental damage from air raids on synthetic fuel plants, the flood of refugees and the retreating Wehrmacht issuing from the east, and finally the Red Army. Overall freight car placings during the first transportation plan period were 17 percent below normal and during the Ardennes period 13 percent less than usual. In November, hard coal car placings were off by 22 percent, in December by 13 percent. But in January 1945 the roof fell in. The advance of the Red Army caused a 53.2 percent decline compared to the monthly average of the first quarter of 1944. By early January, car placings were insufficient for satisfying the Reichsbahn’s own needs for locomotive coal. The phenomenon that occurred in the west repeated itself in Upper Silesia. Car placings plummeted, forcing the reduction in marshalling for freight other than coal. Yet they continued to fall until even the locomotives could not be satisfied, forcing additional reductions in traffic. The disease fed itself until the sufferer was completely debilitated. Traff
