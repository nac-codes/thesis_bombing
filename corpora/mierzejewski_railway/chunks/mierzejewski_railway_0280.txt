ures to maintain operations in RBD Halle, dispatching locomotives to it and transferring some of its marshalling responsibilities east. It took over sections of RBD Han-over.1&! It also continued putting aside trains on a massive scale. Here as in the west, there was no car shortage. The problem was bringing cars to the places where they were needed. Nevertheless, at hopelessly inadequate levels. The coup de grace that lead to the cessation of railway and economic activity was administered by the Red Army. On 16 January 1945, after repeatedly painting the blackest pictures of Germany’s industrial future due to the disaster in the Ruhr, Speer warned Hitler that the Red Army had knifed into Upper Silesia. The coal Magistrale was endangered. Germany’s last hope of continuing even token resistance was slipping from its grasp. If the Magistrale were lost, Speer warned, the Reichsbahn would stop rolling in a few days, and German industry, such of it as was still operating, would grind to a halt.163 However, even this was a problem for the future. Hitler was fighting the war with the barest economic expedients and he ignored Speer.  The combination of the disruption of transportation and the approach of the Soviets caused a serious decline in economic activity throughout eastern Germany. Over half of the coal miners in Upper Silesia were non-Germans. Hearing of the advance of the Red Army to the region’s doorstep, they increasingly stayed away from their jobs, and when they did come, used every pretext to shirk. So not only did production decline, as seen earlier, but efficiency deteriorated markedly, and the quality of the coal cut worsened. Transportation problems caused hard coal stocks at Upper Silesian mines to rise in December to 159.6 percent above the fourth quarter 1943 monthly average. Coke stocks at the same time were an astronomical 974.3 percent above normal. As a direct result, gas production sank, enabling the works to satisfy only one-sixth of demand.16&4
