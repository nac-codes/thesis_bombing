ll markedly and stopped on Christmas because of ice on the Oder.168 Overall coal deliveries to Berlin in December were a third below normal.1£2 As a result coal supplies at the city’s gas works dropped to just sixteen days instead of the target of thirty-two.122 At BEWAG the board of directors contemplated shutting their four least efficient plants to save coal. They feared that if coal supplies did not improve the utility would close entirely by mid-February 1945171 BEWAG received a tenth less coal in November and December than during the previous year, almost all of it from Upper Silesia. Due to government pressure and the declining quality of what it received, coal consumption actually rose in December by 7 percent. Stocks fell to a third below normal.122 Electricity production held steady.1Z2 Clearly, however, the end was in sight.  The interdependence of the various components of the Reichsbahn and their coordination with the inland waterway system were the key factors in their successful support of the economic division of labor in Germany until the autumn of 1944. Each segment performed a specific function. The entire system was more powerful than the sum of the output of its individual constituents because of its flexibility and specialization. The disruption of these relationships fatally weakened the German economy’s capacity to produce arms and other goods. Therefore, to put matters into perspective it might help to consider the overall performance of the Reichsbahn during the decisive period November 1944 to January 1945.  In so far as the ZVL was concerned, the crucial problem was its inability to bring empty cars to the places where they were needed. This situation was exacerbated by the collapse of barge traffic on the west German canals and the Rhine. It attempted to compensate by giving coal highest priority in receiving car space, even over food. Nevertheless, major declines occurred in car space available for moving coal and armaments.
