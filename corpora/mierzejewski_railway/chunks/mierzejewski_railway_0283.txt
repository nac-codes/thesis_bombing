attempted to compensate by giving coal highest priority in receiving car space, even over food. Nevertheless, major declines occurred in car space available for moving coal and armaments. Emrich, at the meeting of 18 December 1944, emphasized how the combination of marshalling yard attacks, confusion in RBD Halle, and the inescapable need to support the Wehrmacht in the Ardennes was debilitating the Reichsbahn. The clearest indicator of this was the backlog of trains that mushroomed out of control in late December and in January.174 Too many marshalling yards operated at reduced levels or not at all; too many lines, especially the two gateways passing over the viaducts, were out; too many telephone connections had collapsed.12 The very system of controlling the movement of trains, the block signals, disintegrated in early January.126 Ganzenmiiller demanded more flak and fighter protection, an end to the conscription of his personnel into the Volkssturm, and a reduction in the demand for car space to the amount that the DR could provide.122 But the Reichsbahn continued to sink, its heart, the marshalling yards in the Ruhr, beat- ing ever more faintly, its ability to give them assistance evaporating under the merciless pummeling of the Allied bombers.  During the period of the first transportation plan, general freight car placings fell 22.8 percent below the level attained during the same period in 1943.
