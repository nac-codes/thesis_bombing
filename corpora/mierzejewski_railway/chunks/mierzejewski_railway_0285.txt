about 90 percent of combined demand was fulfilled.18° Of decisive significance was the steady decline in coal car placings. By January 1945, hard coal car placings for the entire Reichsbahn were 55.8 percent below the previous year’s first quarter monthly average. Brown coal car placings were 26.4 percent lower.181 Movements of all types of coal on the inland waterways were 78.7 percent in arrears in December.182 The vital supplement to the Reichsbahn, the barges, had been ripped away by the bombers. The ZVL understood this and that there was no shortage of vehicles. Losses to strafing were trivial. At the end of December 1944 the Reichsbahn had more steam locomotives, 34,032, and a larger reserve of them, 6,114, than in July 1944. But 3,000 were idled by the lack of coal to fuel them. On 6 January 1945 the Reichsbahn turned to using brown coal to power its locomotives. This was risky. Brown coal fouled the fireboxes, emitted a cloud of heavy smoke filled with sparks that attracted Allied fighters, and could ignite flammable cargo. Fuel consumption tripled, and this necessitated the use of a second fireman and a larger tender.183  ee Se Soe eee SS EEE EEE eee eee ee ee ee ae eee Oe eee going to work. Finally, ice appeared on the Oder in early December and severely restricted traffic in January.165 The impact of these difficulties was felt in Berlin. Arrivals of coal-bearing barges from the Ruhr had virtually ceased. But into December, vessels appeared steadily from Upper Silesia.166 Coal receipts by waterway were a fifth below target in November, entirely as a result of the DEK and MLK obstacles.162 At the end of December, arrivals fell markedly and stopped on Christmas because of ice on the Oder.168 Overall coal deliveries to Berlin in December were a third below normal.12 As a result coal supplies at the city’s gas works dropped to just sixteen days instead of the target of thirty-two.122 it received, coal consumption actually rose in December by 7 percent.
