A one-third reduction in armaments production had occurred soon after similar or even greater losses had been sustained by basic industry. But more had been accomplished by transportation bombing. The actual supply of weapons to the Wehrmacht shrank. Acceptances of the K98 rifle were down from their November 1944 peak by 12 percent, and stocks were down by Page 156 of 282 57% 1945.
