But when the object of analysis intentionally conceals as much of this information as possible, when efforts to obtain it are hindered by weather and bureaucratic obstructionism, then the task becomes infinitely more difficult. All of these impediments hindered the Allies in their attempt to peer across the Rhine to determine what had happened to the German economy as a result of their bombing. The military officers and uniformed civilians engaged in judging the importance of economic intelligence repeatedly blundered. Poor weather reduced the volume of information that could be gleaned from photo reconnaissance. Equally important, stubborn bureaucratic opposition excluded some very revealing information gained by SIGINT.
