Moreover, some of its members felt that the deputy supreme commander had tried to dupe them by calling for the heavy bombers to attack railway targets to support the army when he in fact hoped to to use these raids to pursue his economic goals.15 But fundamentally the CSTC was wedded to oil and would consider other target systems only with the utmost reluctance. Only Tedder’s intelligence staff at SHAEF managed to put the puzzle together, although it lacked many important pieces.

But especially in January, it experienced grave difficulty influencing the selection of targets because its chief was in eclipse. Tedder was among the greatest losers from the Ardennes surprise. His strategy seemed to have been decisively refuted by the panzer divisions. He had also come into conflict with some of the Allied grou
