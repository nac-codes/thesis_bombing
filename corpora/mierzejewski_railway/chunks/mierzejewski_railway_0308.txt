er than has hitherto been thought to be the case.”21 The slow process of coming to perceive the chaos reigning in Germany took an important step forward in February 1945. As part of the reevaluation of Allied air strategy set off by the Ardennes offensive, Sir Norman Bottomley Deputy Chief of Air Staff of the RAF, ordered a complete review of Ultra, relating to the transportation offensive. The study demonstrated that for months the CSTC had been suppressing Enigma information on the Reichsbahn and the economy. Oliver L. Lawrence said that 20,000 commercial intercepts were made weekly but they were not analysed because they were not “likely to be particularly instructive.”22 The report resulting from Bottomley’s investigation appeared on 28 February and yielded a cornucopia of startling information. One Ultra decrypt, dated 15 February 1945, read, “Although there are accumulations (commodities) such as coal in the places where they are produced, the inability to transport them is having an adverse effect on the production of various war supplies.”23 Another, which had lain unused since October 1944, stated, “On 20 October, Reich Minister for Equipment and War Production reported that, on account of destruction of traffic installations and lack of power, from 30 to 50 percent of all works in west Germany were at a standstill.”24 Other reports detailed the fall in coal stocks, the crippling of utility service, and the sharp decline: in armaments production.22 This “new” information was insufficient to decide the bombing debate. Too many powerful individuals had strongly condemned the transportation offensive for there to be a quick reversal due simply to the appearance of new evidence. A “golden bridge” was necessary to salvage their reputations. That escape route was provided by the Red Army when it overran Upper Silesia.
