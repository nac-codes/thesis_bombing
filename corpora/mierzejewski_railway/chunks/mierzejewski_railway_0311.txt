an air offensive to isolate the Rhenish-Westphalian industrial region.22 By the end of the month it had completely adopted the SHAEF position. Its meeting of 28 February was dominated by discussion of the low level of Ruhr coal traffic and its vulnerability to bombing. A plan to isolate the region was proposed and tentatively accepted.31 Tedder’s dual aims were retained. In mid-February Eisenhower and the SHAEF operations staff designated the Ruhr as the primary target for their planned ground offensive.32 With the change in the CSTC outlook, air-reconnaissance coverage was shifted to the coal gateways and photo interpreters were ordered to observe marshalling and coal stocks at the locomotive sheds.32  Tedder had won a major victory which enabled him to steer priorities toward transportation. But the struggle remained difficult because a variety of powerful political factors heavily influenced target selection. The desire to end the war quickly by assisting the advancing armies, including the Soviets, and finally breaking the German people’s will to resist caused frequent changes in target priorities. In mid-January oil shared first priority with jet aircraft plants. Transportation targets, especially on routes serving the Ruhr, were next.34 Then at the end of the month, the Berlin, Leipzig, and Dresden urban areas were raised to second position, transportation falling to third.25 Churchill had decided that a final series of massive blows would push the German people to despair and to demand peace from their leaders.

Because of the lack of consensus and the Ardennes crisis, priorities were set very broadly. The CSTC and the air commanders met weekly to choose objectives in light of the latest int
