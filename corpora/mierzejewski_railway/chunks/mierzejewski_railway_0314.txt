He resorted to behind-the-scenes maneuvering to have them lifted to first position.32 A new feature of the attack, complementing the blows to marshalling yards, would be a major effort to Tedder faced an additional threat. At the 1 February air commander s’ meeting, Spaatz had proposed an attack on a large number of small railway facilities scattered throughout Germany. He hoped thereby to both weaken the Reichsbahn and to demonstrate Allied air superiority to the German people. He hoped that this would bring a rapid end to the fighting. Spaatz’s proposal was not new. Similar schemes had been bruited about since the autumn. Tedder had opposed them as a dispersal of effort. The key to his conception was the concentration on transportation facilities that served the Ruhr and that played a major role in the functioning of the Reichsbahn. Clarion, as Spaatz’s plan was dubbed, promised only dispersal of effort in terms of both geographical scope and impact on DR facilities. Tedder was unable or unwilling to prevent Clarion, possibly for fear of alienating Spaatz, who had been cooperating with him. Consequently, both the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces, flying at low altitude in clear weather on 22 February, struck stations, grade crossings, bridges, and marshalling yards across Germany, most of which had never been bombed before. Spaatz was so pleased with the apparent results that he ordered Clarion repeated on the next day. But the impact was slight. Dorpmiiller stated after the war that the the attacks flown on the two days had been indistin- guishable from any others.44 Meanwhile the CSTC had completed its plan to isolate the Ruhr. The scheme was approved at the air commanders’ conference held on 1 Marc
