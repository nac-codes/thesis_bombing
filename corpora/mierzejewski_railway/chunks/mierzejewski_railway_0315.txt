on the two days had been indistin- guishable from any others.44 Meanwhile the CSTC had completed its plan to isolate the Ruhr. The scheme was approved at the air commanders’ conference held on 1 March. The Ruhr Plan, or Bugle as Tedder dubbed it, had two objectives. In order of importance, they were to cut off coal traffic from the region and to prevent reinforcement of the armies defending it against the planned Allied ground attack.45 A bridge or viaduct would be cut on every line leading from the region in an arc stretching from Bremen to the Weser, to Bielefeld, and south to Koblenz. In all, eighteen bridges and viaducts were pinpointed, six of which were assigned to the heavy bombers. Within the arc every marshalling yard and locomotive-servicing facility was to be bombed heavily and repeatedly These hammer blows would be com- plemented by strafing intended to cause local stoppages and create confusion.  Tedder had won another bureaucratic victory. However, it meant little for the outcome of the war. Even before the Ruhr Plan was implemented, the Rhenish-Westphalian region had ceased to play its role in the German economy’s division of labor. The cascade of bombs that it unleashed, however, may have helped convince Germany’s economic leaders that continued resistance was hopeless. Under the interim plan, 50,000 tons of bombs was dropped on transportation targets in February. In March the same amount was expended.4¢ In both months the lion’s share was contributed by the Eighth Air Force—35,141 tons in February, 28,563 tons in March.42 Marshalling yards and other transportation targets sustained the most bombing, far ahead of oil targets and airfields, the next most heavily hit categories. Bomber Command kept the Dortmund-Ems and Mittelland canals closed with raids in February. A total of seventeen attacks was flown against the three main viaducts by the Eighth Air Force and Bomber Command. It was Bomber Command, using its heavy 12,000 and 22,000 pound weapons,
