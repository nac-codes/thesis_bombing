in February. A total of seventeen attacks was flown against the three main viaducts by the Eighth Air Force and Bomber Command. It was Bomber Command, using its heavy 12,000 and 22,000 pound weapons, that smashed each of them: Bielefeld on 14 March, Altenbecken on 19 March,  Page 167 of 282 61% ee eee cee eee ee ee Ae A RR RE ae, A SERRE AE Ae SERS Cy ee ee eee Pes ee ee ee eee ee Oe eee ey eae ee and Dresden urban areas were raised to second position, transportation falling to third.35 Churchill had decided that a final series of massive blows would push the German people to despair and to and the Ruhr arteries through Paderborn, Hamm, and Minster last.28 Tedder realized that although the coal gateways figured prominently in these priorities, the crucial routes leading to the east were slighted. He resorted to behind-the-scenes maneuvering to have them lifted to first position.22 A new feature of the attack, complementing the blows to marshalling yards, would be a major effort to Under the interim plan, 50,000 tons of bombs was dropped on transportation targets in February. In March the same amount was expended.4£ In both months the lion’s share was contributed by the and Arnsberg on 20 March. Overall, the Allied air forces flew forty-two major attacks against eighteen bridges and viaducts linking the Ruhr to its hinterland. Ten were completely destroyed, three were damaged and therefore impassable, and only one partly passable. Two came under artillery fire leaving only two operational.48 The Luftwaffe attempted to ward off these attacks by concentrating flak along the coal gateways, near bridges and viaducts on the Hamm, Miinster, and Soest routes and near important grade crossings on the Vorhalle line.42 The effort was too weak and came too late.  The Reichsbahn, already reeling from months of repeated sledgehammer blows, finally came to a halt.
