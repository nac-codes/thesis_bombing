ready reeling from months of repeated sledgehammer blows, finally came to a halt. Although a few trains furtively made their way to Wehrmacht units carrying armaments or out of the Ruhr bearing a few tons of coal, for all practical purposes the wheels had stopped rolling. By the end of March, overall car placings were only 11 percent of normal.52 In the Ruhr, coal car placings were a mere 10 percent of normal in February and by the end of March had ceased altogether. RBD Halle still placed cars for brown coal at three-quarters of the usual February level.54 But this —oee SS oS ee eS ee ee eee eee eee ee eee ee ee a oS ee ee ee ee and the Ruhr arteries through Paderborn, Hamm, and Minster last.28 Tedder realized that although the coal gateways figured prominently in these priorities, the crucial routes leading to the east were Under the interim plan, 50,000 tons of bombs was dropped on transportation targets in February. In March the same amount was expended.46 In both months the lion’s share was contributed by the could not balance the losses suffered in the west and the east. Many of the trains simply sank into the backlog that soared to over 2,800.52 Locomotive coal supplies were so scarce that some engineers desperately seeking fuel drove their engines to mine sidings.23 The DR operated only 7,000 of its locomotives. About 23,000 were idled by lack of fuel and damage to repair facilities.54 Cars continued to be derailed by the thousands. The DR even offered to give freight cars to companies so long as they would be removed from its rails.52 Ganzenmiiller admitted to Hitler in February that traffic in the south and west was paralyzed and that no real control was being exerted by Berlin in the remaining areas.56 While the Allies struggled to gain a reasonably accurate picture of events in the Reich, its economy sank deeper into the morass. In February hard coal production was a pitiful 30 percent of normal.52 In the Ruhr coal production was off by 56 percent and co
