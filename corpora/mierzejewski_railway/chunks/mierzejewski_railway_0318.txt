picture of events in the Reich, its economy sank deeper into the morass. In February hard coal production was a pitiful 30 percent of normal.52 In the Ruhr coal production was off by 56 percent and coke output by two-thirds compared to the average monthly results for the first quarter of 1944.58 But even this just piled up at the pit heads. Coal stocks left undeliverable at the mines were now 443.2 percent above the preceding year’s level.52 Brown coal production could provide no relief. Due to the loss of territory and reductions in the cut because the Reichsbahn could not move it, brown coal output was down by 44 percent.£2 Consequently, only 5 to 10 percent of the greatly reduced demand could be satisfied.£1 Both national and Ruhr steel output were just a quarter of normal.62 The armaments production index collapsed to the level of late 1942. It fell fifty-two points in February alone.®2 The cessation of deliveries, not just of production, meant that a weapons and ammunition shortage debilitated the Wehrmacht for the last battles to defend the fatherland. The Stinder and Kérner Works in Velbert in the Ruhr, west of Essen, ceased operations because 2,300 kilograms of high priority armaments goods choked its facilities. Some of them had been awaiting transport since October.64 The OKW complained that instead  Page 168 of 282 61% along the coal gateways, near bridges and viaducts on the Hamm, Minster, and Soest routes and near important grade crossings on the Vorhalle line.42 The effort was too weak and came too late. placings were a mere 10 percent of normal in February and by the end of March had ceased altogether. RBD Halle still placed cars for brown coal at three-quarters of the usual February level.+4 But this desperately seeking fuel drove their engines to mine sidings.33 The DR operated only 7,000 of its locomotives. About 23,000 were idled by lack of fuel and damage to repair facilities.54 Cars continued to be derailed by the thousands. The DR even offered
