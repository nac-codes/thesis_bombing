The cessation of deliveries, not just of the forty-nine trains that it usually received each day carrying munitions, in February only eight or nine arrived per day.§° Stocks of the Type 44 machine pistol and the K98 rifle dwindled to just three days, light field howitzers to two days, Panther tanks to one.

In his report of 27 January Speer stopped short of openly calling for capitulation. Instead, as we have seen, he wrote vaguely of fighting to preserve the German people and the preconditions for their existence.74 This could easily have been interpreted to mean continued armed resistance since Hitler had claimed to be waging the war to protect the Volk from extinction.

Significantly however, he placed food second.25 On 1 March he ordered a new, frantic effort; to repair marshalling yards to maintain traffic; 800,000 people were to be thrown into the struggle.Z6 Prisoners of war, concentration camp inmates, idled factory workers, and others from armaments plants were committed. But again the order emphasized that this was necessary for the successful continuation of the war.
