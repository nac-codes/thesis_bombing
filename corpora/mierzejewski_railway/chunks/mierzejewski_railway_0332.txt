exceptions and until it was quite late, they misunderstood the nature of the task facing them. Those segments of the Allied apparatus that did approach an accurate understanding were obstructed in translating it into an effective policy. In the end, the air forces suc- ceeded because of the crushing superiority of power at their disposal and because of the successful bureaucratic game played by Sir Arthur Tedder.  The most fundamental mistakes were committed at the outset. MEW overestimated the degree of mobilization imposed upon the German economy and its overall level of efficiency. Consequently it exaggerated both its output and its susceptibility to external pressure. From the spring of 1943 MEW reversed the error, underestimating Germany’s effort and output and pessimistically evaluating the potential for economic collapse. MEW was not alone in this. Every other agency engaged in the evaluation of intelligence on the German economy failed to question the universally accepted assumption concerning the Reich’s allegedly high level of effort during the critical early years of the war. This was due to lack of preliminary study and, in the case of the Americans during the war, due to intellectual conformity, hasty analysis under deadlines set by command authorities, and mirror imaging. The upshot was that the air planners frequently received faulty advice for target selection.

Until the advent of Tedder and Zuckerman, only a few agencies understood the role of the Reichsbahn and marshalling yards, and they lacked the bureaucratic influence to make their views felt. Most of them, for a time including Zuckerman, confused locomotive strength with a railroad’s capacity to move freight. Although Tedder and Zuckerman never fully rid themselves of this misconception, beginning in the summer of 1944 they did sense the importance of marshalling and its cru- c
