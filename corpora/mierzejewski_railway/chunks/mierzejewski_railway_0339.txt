urce of Germany’s economic difficulties, far outweighing the loss of the occupied territories.2 The transportation offensive severely weakened the German economy from October 1944 and induced its collapse in early January 1945. Allowing time for the consumption of the few meager reserves remaining with combat units, it can be claimed that the transportation campaign, imperfect as it was, gravely weakened the Wehrmacht from early January 1945 and would have compelled it to abandon organized armed resistance by May or June 1945. In light of Speer’s estimate, it can be argued that transportation bombing placed a limit on how long the war could continue. Infighting among the Allied air commanders prevented the campaign from realizing its full potential, causing its fatal influence to be narrowly superseded by the advance of the ground forces. Indisputable and of real importance is the fact that transportation bombing weakened the Wehrmacht’s ability to resist during the final six months of the war and ensured that once the Allies broke into Germany no coherent front could be formed against them again. Transportation bombing did not achieve and could not have achieved victory unaided. Rather it formed a vital component of the strategic compromise that resulted in the ultimate triumph. The attack on Germany’s synthetic petroleum industry led to crucial air battles that cemented Allied air superiority and caused a fuel shortage that virtually grounded the Luftwaffe and severely restricted the mobility of the army Again, though, it must be stressed that the throttling of Germany’s petroleum supplies was of military and not economic importance: and could not have been decisive alone  Ae neran oumavrendnd teanenactatian hambina in influianan an tha final autanma Tha Dad Reme imnnand an tha Carman ave that dnhilitatina atteitian urhinh ume tha indienananhla aneallacrr ta tha  Page 180 of 282 65% bomber offensive as measured by tonnage and the overriding source of Germany’s eco
