ing odds and the overriding importance of the psychological and time factors in the final collapse of Nazi Germany help to explain the frustration of the: American air effort over North Vietnam between 1965 and 1968. This point assumes greater importance when it is recalled that some of the same personalities who helped the Eighth Air Force select targets and who obstructed the transportation offensive during 1944 played key roles in establishing the strategy to bomb North Vietnam. Forty years after the events described here the concept of strategic bombing, albeit in new permutations, continues to be a source of heated debate. That is in large part because the brave struggle of the Deutsche Reichsbahn related here has been misunderstood.
