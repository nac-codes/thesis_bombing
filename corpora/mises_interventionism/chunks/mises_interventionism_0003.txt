production, or it can establish a command system in which government owns or manages all production and distribution. There is no logical third system of a private property order subject to government regulation. The "middle of the road" leads to socialism because government intervention is not only su- perfluous and useless, but also harmful. It is superfluous be- 9  cause the interdependence of market phenomena narrowly circumscribes individual action and economic relations. It is useless because government regulation cannot achieve the objectives it is supposed to achieve. And it is harmful be- cause it hampers man's productive efforts where, from the consumers' viewpoint, they are most useful and valuable. It lowers labor productivity and redirects production along lines of political command, rather than consumer satisfac- tion. And yet, most American economists tenaciously cling to their faith in the middle of the road with all its government regulations and controls. Like the German "Socialists of the Chair," whose doctrines face Professor von Mises' incisive critique in these pages, American "mainstream" economists are seeking the safety of an impartial middle position be- tween classical liberalism and communism. But while they may feel safe on the middle of the road, hopefully equally distant from the competing systems, they are actually pav- ing the way for socialism. Paul A. Samuelson, the "mainstream economist" par ex- cellence, devotes his Economics (New York: McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1976), the textbook for millions of students, to modern post-Keynesian political economy, whose fruits, ac- cording to the author, are "the better working of the mixed economy" (p. 845). Like the Socialists of the Chair long be- fore him, he simply ignores "conservative counterattacks against mainstream economics." He neither defines nor de- scribes these attacks, which he repels with a four-line ges- ture of disgust after he announces them in a boldface title. With selfishn
