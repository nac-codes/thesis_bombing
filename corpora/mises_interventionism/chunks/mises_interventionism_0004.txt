ttacks against mainstream economics." He neither defines nor de- scribes these attacks, which he repels with a four-line ges- ture of disgust after he announces them in a boldface title. With selfishness, ignornace, and malice "there is not much intellectual arguing that can be done" (p. 847). He devotes half a page to the "Chicago School Libertar- ianism" of men like Frank Knight, Henry C. Simons, Fried- rich Hayek, and Milton Friedman. And like the Socialists of the Chair, he merely labels pleas for individual freedom and the private property order as "provocative negations." His favorite target, Milton Friedman, is dispatched with an ugly joke: "If Milton Friedman had never existed, it would have been necessary to invent him" (p. 848). But the champions of all-round government ownership or control in the means of production are treated with utmost courtesy and respect. He devotes eight pages of text supple- mented by eight pages of appendix to "eminent," "compe- tent," and "eloquent" advocates of radical economics from Karl Marx to John G. Gurley. He quotes extensively from their writings without refuting any of their arguments. To Samuelson, as to the Socialists of the Chair, Karl Marx "was as much a philosopher, historian, sociologist, and revolu- tionist. And make no mistake. He was a learned man" (p. 855). In fact, Samuelson echoes Engels: "Marx was a genius the rest of us were talented at best" (p. 853). If this is the middle of the road, or "mainstream econom- ics," the future of the American private property system is overshadowed by the dark clouds of Marxian doctrine and policy. This is why Ludwig von Mises' Critique of Interven- tionism is as pertinent and timely today as it was half a cen- tury ago. HANS F.
