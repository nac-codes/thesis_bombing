te property or its "limitation." All this is insignificant for our discussion and, therefore, does not concern us here. 2. Partial socialization of the means of production is no intervention in our sense. The concept of intervention as- sumes that private property is not abolished, but that it still exists in substance rather than merely in name. Nationaliza- tion of a railroad constitutes no intervention; but a decree that orders an enterprise to charge lower freight rates than it otherwise would is intervention. 3. Government measures that use market means, that is, seek to influence demand and supply through changes of 19  market factors, are not included in this concept of interven- tion. If government buys milk in the market in order to sell it inexpensively to destitute mothers or even to distribute it without charge, or if government subsidizes educational in- stitutions, there is no intervention. (We shall return to the question of whether the method by which government ac- quires the means for such actions constitutes "interven- tion.") However, the imposition of price ceilings for milk signifies intervention. Intervention is a limited order by a social authority forcing the owners of the means of production and entrepreneurs to employ their means in a different manner than they otherwise would. A "limited order" is an order that is no part of a socialist scheme of orders, i.e., a scheme of orders regulating all of production and distribution, thus replacing private prop- erty in the means of production with public property. Par- ticular orders may be quite numerous, but as long as they do not aim at directing the whole economy and replacing the profit motive of individuals with obedience as the driv- ing force of human action they must be regarded as limited orders. By "means of production" we mean all goods of higher order, including the merchants' inventories of ready goods which have not yet reached the consumers. We must distinguish between two groups
