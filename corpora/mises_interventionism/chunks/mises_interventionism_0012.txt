rders. By "means of production" we mean all goods of higher order, including the merchants' inventories of ready goods which have not yet reached the consumers. We must distinguish between two groups of such orders. One group directly reduces or impedes economic produc- tion (in the broadest sense of the word including the loca- tion of economic goods). The other group seeks to fix prices that differ from those of the market. The former may be called "restrictions of production"; the latter, generally known as price controls, we are calling "interference with the structure of prices." 3 3. There may be some doubt about the suitability of a third group: interference by taxation which consists of expropriation of some wealth or income. We did not allow for such a group because the effects of such intervention may in part be iden- tical with those of production restrictions, and in part consist of influencing the distribution of production income without redirecting production itself. 20 3. Restrictions of Production Economics need not say much about the immediate effect of production restrictions. Government or any organization of coercion can at first achieve what it sets out to achieve through intervention. But whether it can achieve the re- moter objectives sought indirectly by the intervention is a different question. And it must further be determined whether the result is worth the cost, that is, whether the in- tervening authority would embark upon the intervention if it were fully aware of the costs. An import duty, for in- stance, is surely practical, and its immediate effect may correspond to the government's objective. But it does not follow at all that the import duty can realize the govern- ment's ultimate objective. At this point the economist's work commences. The purpose of the theorists of free trade was not to demonstrate that tariffs are impractical or harm- ful, but that they have unforeseen consequences and do not, nor can they, achieve what their
