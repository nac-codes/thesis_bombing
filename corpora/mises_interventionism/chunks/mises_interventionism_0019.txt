labor union coercion were ineffec- tive, the unemployed would exert a labor market pressure that would reduce the artificially raised wages to the nat- ural market rate. But this escape has been closed. Unem- ployment, a friction phenomenon that soon disappears in an 6. It should be noted that we are not dealing here with the question of whether or not wage rates can be raised permanently and universally through collective bar- gaining, but with the consequences of a general wage boost achieved artificially through physical coercion. To avoid a theoretical difficulty pertaining to money, namely that a general rise in prices is impossible without a change in the ratio be- tween the quantity of money and its demand, we may assume that together with the boost in wages a corresponding reduction in the demand for money takes place through a reduction in cash holdings (e.g., as a result of additional paydays). 26 unhampered market order, becomes a permanent institu- tion in interventionism. As government did not mean to create such a condition, it must intervene again. It forces employers either to rein- state the unemployed workers and pay the fixed rate, or to pay taxes that compensate the unemployed. Such a burden consumes the owners' income, or at least reduces it greatly. It is even conceivable that the entrepreneurs' and owners' income no longer can carry this burden, but that it must be paid out of capital. But if nonlabor income is consumed by such burdens we realize that it must lead to capital con- sumption. Capitalists and entrepreneurs, too, want to con- sume and live even when they are earning no incomes. They will consume capital. Therefore, it is unsuitable and illogical to deprive entrepreneurs, capitalists, and land owners of their incomes and leave control over the means of produc- tion in their hands. Obviously, the consumption of capital in the end reduces wage rates. If the market wage structure is unacceptable the whole private property order must b
