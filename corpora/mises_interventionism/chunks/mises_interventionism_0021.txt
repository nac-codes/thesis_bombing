te with the Atlantean indus- try through lower labor costs. It is obvious that in addition to the declining capital return of industry in Atlantis, and the declining land rent in Thule, wage rates in both coun- tries must fall. The decline in income corresponds to the de- clining social product. But Atlantis is a "social" country. Labor unions prevent a reduction in wage rates. Production costs of Atlantean in- dustry remain at the old pre-import-duty levels. As sales in Thule decline Atlantean industry must discharge some workers. Unemployment compensation prevents the flow of unemployed labor to agriculture. Unemployment thus be- comes a permanent institution.7 The exportation of coal from Great Britain has declined. Inasmuch as the unneeded miners cannot emigrate-be- cause other countries do not want them-they must move to those British industries that are expanding in order to com- pensate for the smaller imports that follow the decline in ex- ports. A reduction in wage rates in coal mining may bring about this movement. But labor unions may hamper this unavoidable adjustment for years, albeit temporarily. In the end, the decline in the international division of labor must bring about a reduction in standards of living. And this re- duction must be all the greater, the more capital has been consumed through "social" intervention. Austrian industry suffers from the fact that other coun- tries are raising their import duties continually on Austrian products and are imposing ever new import restrictions, 7. On the question of how collective bargaining can temporarily raise wage rates see my essay "Die allgemeine Teuerung im Lichte der theoretischen National- Ã¶konomie" [The high costs of living in the light of economic theory] in vol. 37 of Ar- chiv, p. 570 et seq.
