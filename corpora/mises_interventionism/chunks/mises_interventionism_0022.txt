If the immigration barriers to the U.S., Australia, et cetera, would be removed, European workers could emigrate, which would gradually lead to an international equalization of wage rates. The permanent unemployment of hundreds of thousands and millions of people on the one hand, and the consump- tion of capital on the other hand, are each consequences of interventionism's artificial raising of wage rates by labor unions and unemployment compensation. 5.
