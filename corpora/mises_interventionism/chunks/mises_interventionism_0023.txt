ntervention- ism has been the gist of politics in all countries in Europe and America. The economic layman only observes that "interested par- ties" succeed again and again in escaping the strictures of law. The fact that the system functions poorly is blamed ex- clusively on the law that does not go far enough, and on cor- ruption that prevents its application. The very failure of interventionism reinforces the layman's conviction that pri- vate property must be controlled severely. The corruption of the regulatory bodies does not shake his blind confidence in the infallibility and perfection of the state; it merely fills him with moral aversion to entrepreneurs and capitalists. But the violation of law is not an evil that merely needs to be eradicated in order to create paradise on earth, an evil that flows from human weakness so difficult to uproot, as etatists so naively proclaim. If all interventionist laws were really to be observed they would soon lead to absurdity. All wheels would come to a halt because the strong arm of gov- ernment comes too close. Our contemporaries view the matter like this: farmers and milk dealers conspire to raise the price of milk. Then comes the state, the welfare state, to bring relief, pitting common interest against special interest, public economic view against private point of view.

It is not so easy to oppose the profit motive of pressure groups that are injurious to the public. The laws must there- fore be strengthened and enforced without consideration or mercy. In reality, the situation is quite different. If the price ceil- ings were really enforced, the delivery of milk and dairy products to the cities would soon
