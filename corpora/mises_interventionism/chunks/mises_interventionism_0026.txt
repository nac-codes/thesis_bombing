The decay of busi- ness morals, which is called "inflation effect," is the inevi- table concomitant of the regulations that were imposed on trade and production during the inflation. It may be said that the system of interventionism has be- come bearable through the laxity of enforcement. Even the interferences with prices are said to lose their disruptive power if the entrepreneurs can "correct" the situation with money and persuasion. Surely, it cannot be denied that it would be better without the intervention. But, after all, public opinion must be accommodated. Interventionism is seen as a tribute that must be paid to democracy in order to preserve the capitalistic system.

To them, private property in the means of production is an institution that favors the interests of landowners, capitalists, and entre- preneurs at the expense of the public. Its preservation solely serves the interests of the propertied classes. So, if by mak- ing a few painless concessions these classes can salvage the institution that is so beneficial to them, and yet so harmful 32 to all other classes, why jeopardize its preservation by ada- mantly refusing the concessions? Of course, those who do not share this view regarding "bourgeois" interests cannot accept this line of thought.

But if it is found that private prop- erty is useful to all, and that human society with its division of labor could not be organized in any other way, then it must be safeguarded so that it can serve its function in the best possib
