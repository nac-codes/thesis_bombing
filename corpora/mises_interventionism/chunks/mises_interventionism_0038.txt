In a discussion of an economic regulation they are rarely in- clined to examine properly and carefully whether the in- tended result was actually achieved, and if it was achieved, whether it was brought about by the regulation or some other factors. They surely lack the ability to perceive all con- comitant effects that, from the point of view of the regula- tors, were desirable or undesirable. Only in monetary his- tory did the better quality of some works stand out. Their authors were equipped with some knowledge of monetary theory (Gresham's law, quantity theory), and therefore bet- ter understood the work they were to do. The most important qualification of a researcher into "facts" is complete mastery of economic theory. He must in- terpret the available material in the light of theory. If he does not succeed in this, or it leaves him unsatisfied, he must precisely elaborate the critical point, and formulate the problem that needs to be solved theoretically. Others then may try to solve the task. The failure is his, not that of theory. A theory explains everything. Theories do not fail in individual problems; they fail because of their own short- comings. He who seeks to replace one theory with another must either fit it into the given system, or create a new sys- tem into which it fits. It is wholly unscientific to start with observed "facts" and then announce the failure of "theory" and system. The genius who advances science with new knowledge can gain valuable information from the observa- tion of a minute process, either overlooked or deemed insig- nificant by those before him. His mind is excited over every obje
