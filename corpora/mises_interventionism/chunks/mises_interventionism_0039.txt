cience with new knowledge can gain valuable information from the observa- tion of a minute process, either overlooked or deemed insig- nificant by those before him. His mind is excited over every object. But the inventor replaces the old with the new, not through negation, but with a view toward the whole and the system. We need not here deal with the deeper epistemological question of conflicting systems. Nor need we discuss a mul- tiplicity of opposing systems. To investigate the problems of interventionism there are, on the one hand, modern economics together with classical theory and, on the other hand, the deniers of system and theory, no matter how care- fully they word their denial of the possibility of theoretical 43  knowledge. Our answer to them is simple: try to create a system of theoretical knowledge that pleases you more than ours. Then we can talk again. Of course, all the objections raised against theoretical economics are economic "theories." In fact, the objectors themselves are now writing "economic theories" and giving lectures on "theoretical economics." But their work is inade- quate because they neglect to weave the individual tenets of their "theory" into a system, a comprehensive theory of cat- allactics. A theoretical tenet becomes a theory only through a system and in a system. It is very easy to discourse on wage, rent, and interest. But we may speak of a theory only where individual statements are linked to a comprehensive explanation of all market phenomena. In their experiments the natural sciences can eliminate all disturbing influences and observe the consequences of the change of one factor, other conditions being equal. If the re- sult of the experiment cannot be fitted satisfactorily into the given system of theory, it may invite an expansion of the system, or even its replacement by a new one. But he who would conclude from the result of one experiment that there can be no theoretical perception would invite ridicule. The social
