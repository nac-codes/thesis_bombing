Formal science in Germany did not concern itself with economic achieve- ments after the 1870s. All objections were brushed aside by branding them special interest statements of entrepreneurs and capitalists. 9 In the United States, which now seems to assume leader- ship in interventionism, the situation is quite different. In the country of J. B. Clark, Taussig, Fetter, Davenport, Young, and Seligman, it is impossible to ignore all the achievements of economics. It was to be expected, therefore, 9. See the relevant description of this method by Pohle, Die gegenw√§rtige Krisis in der deutschen Volkswirtschaftslehre [The present crisis in German economics], 2nd ed., Leipzig, 1921, p. 115 et seq. 44 45  that an attempt would here be made to prove the realizabil- ity and suitability of interventionism. John Maurice Clark, formerly a University of Chicago professor and now, as was his great father John Bates Clark, professor at Columbia Uni- versity in New York City, has undertaken this very task. 10 We regret, however, that only a single chapter with a few pages deals with the fundamental problems of intervention- ism. Professor Clark distinguishes between two types of so- cial regulation of economic actions: regulation of incidental matters, "those in which the state is dealing with matters which are incidental to the main transaction," and regula- tion of essential matters, "those in which the 'heart of the contract' is at stake and the state presumes to fix the terms of the exchange and dictate the consideration in money or in goods, or to say that the exchange shall not take place at all." 11 This distinction roughly coincides with our distinc- tion between production and price intervention. It is clear that an economic consideration of the system of interven- tionism cannot proceed any differently. In his analysis of "control of matters
