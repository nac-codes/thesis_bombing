ng is illogical. In general, the loan market even for this category of consumer loans is to be left free, with a law to prohibit an interest rate higher than the market rate. "The law . . . may render a great service in preventing the exac- tion of charges which are materially above the true market rate." Therefore, the simplest method, according to Clark, is "to fix a legal rate for this class of loans which liberally covers all costs and necessary inducements, and to forbid all charges in excess of this rate." 14 Surely, when the interest regulation sanctions the market rates or even exceeds them, it can do no harm. It is useless and superfluous. But if it fixes a rate that is lower than that which would develop in an unhampered market, then all the consequences described so well by Clark must emerge. Why, then, the rate fixing? Clark's answer: it is necessary to avoid unfair discrimination. 15 The concept of "unfair" or "undue discriminations" orig- inates in the field of monopoly. 16 If the monopolist as seller is in the position to classify the potential buyers according to purchasing power and desire intensity, to whom he offers his commodity or service at different prices, then he does better without a uniform price. Such conditions are given in most cases of means of transportation, electric power plants, and similar enterprises. The freight rates of railroads repre- sent a nearly classical case of such a differentiation. But 13. Ibid., p. 453 et seq. 14. Ibid., p. 454. 15. Ibid. 16.

However, we need not be concerned with the ethical justification of intervention. From a
