call this practice "unjust," an interventionist charge so naively and resent- fully made against monopolists. However, we need not be concerned with the ethical justification of intervention. From a scientific point of view, we merely must observe that there is room for government intervention in the case of monopoly. But there is also a differential treatment of the various classes of buyers that runs counter to the interests of mo- nopolies. This may be the case where the monopoly is man- aged as a part of a larger enterprise in which the monopoly serves objectives other than greatest profitability. Let us disregard all cases in which the monopolist either is a com- pulsory association or acts under its influence, seeking to achieve certain national, military, or social objectives. Freight rates, for instance, may be set to accommodate for- eign trade, or municipal services may be priced according to customers' income. In all such cases the interventionists approve of the differentiation. To us, only those cases are significant in which the monopolist resorts to differentia- tion that runs counter to his profit interests. It may be that he takes into consideration the interests of his other enter- prises that are more important to him. Or he wants to disad- vantage a buyer for personal reasons, or force him to do or not to do something. In the United States, railroads have favored individual shippers through concessions of lower freight rates, which often forced their competitors to close their businesses or sell them at depressed prices.

Pub- lic opinion viewed the disappearance of competition in in- dividual industries with great alarm. It failed to recognize that competition takes place among producers and sellers not only within each individual branch of production, but also between all related goods, and in the final analysis, between all
