to recognize that competition takes place among producers and sellers not only within each individual branch of production, but also between all related goods, and in the final analysis, between all economic goods. And it did not recognize that the monopolistic price charged by the few genuine monopolies-mining and similar primary production-is not so detrimental to all, as the naive foes of monopolies are willing to assume. 17 But there is no talk of monopoly in Clark's case of the loan market for consumers, small farmers, merchants and trades- men. How is it possible to practice unfair discrimination? When one lender does not lend at the market rate the bor- rower may simply go to another. Of course, it cannot be denied that everyone is inclined-especially among the bor- rowers of this lowest category-to overestimate his own credit rating, and call the rates demanded by creditors too high. J. M. Clark proceeds from a discussion of interest regula- tion to that of minimum wages. "Artificial" wage boosts, he believes, lead to unemployment. The rise in wages raises production costs, and thus the product price. The quantity that was sold at the lower price can no longer be marketed at this higher price. On the one hand, this leaves unsatisfied buyers who would like to buy at the no longer quoted lower price, and on the other hand, it causes unemployment of workers who are willing to work at lower wage rates. Fi- nally, entrepreneurs will be willing to bring this potential demand and supply together. So far we can again agree with Clark. But then comes an assertion that completely misses the mark-that is, that "the regulations affecting the incidental conditions of employ- ment" must have the same consequences since they too raise production costs. 18 But this is not correct. If wages are freely determined in the labor market, no raise in wages above the market rate can occur as a result of interventions, such as the shortening of labor time, mandatory insurance of wo
