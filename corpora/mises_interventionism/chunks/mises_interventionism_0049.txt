prices and raise wages until the market rate is at- tained. But whatever it be, classical liberal principles are not violated if government undertakes to publish relevant data on the formation of market prices. The result of Clark's inquiry into our problem thus does not contradict our own analysis earlier in this essay. Despite Clark's eagerness to prove that the popular interventions are not unsuitable and illogical, he did not succeed in adding anything but the observation that the consequences are in- significant if the intervention is quantitatively unimportant, and that important interventions have undesirable conse- quences that need to be alleviated through more interven- tion. At this point Clark unfortunately halted his discus- sion. If he had proceeded to its conclusion, which he should have done, it too would have clearly revealed the only alter- native: either private property in the means of production is permitted to function freely, or control over the means of production is transferred to organized society, to its appara- tus of coercion, the state. It would have revealed that there can be no other alternative but socialism or capitalism. Thus, Clark's work also, which is the most complete ex- pression of American interventionism, can come to no other conclusion in its discussion of the basic questions of inter- ventionism. Interventionism is a system that is contra- dictory and unsuitable even from the point of view of its sponsors, that cannot be carried out logically, and whose in- troduction in every case can effect nothing but disturbances in the smooth functioning of the social order based on pri- vate property. We owe the most recent German discussion of our prob- lem to Richard Strigl, a member of the Austrian School. Al- though not so outspoken as J. M. Clark, he too sympathizes with interventionism. Every line of his work, which seeks to analyze theoretically the wage problems of intervention- ism,25 clearly reflects his desire to acclaim
