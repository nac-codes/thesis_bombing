as J. M. Clark, he too sympathizes with interventionism. Every line of his work, which seeks to analyze theoretically the wage problems of intervention- ism,25 clearly reflects his desire to acclaim as much as possi- ble social policy in general and labor union policies in par- ticular. All Strigl's statements are carefully worded in the same manner that authors of previous centuries worded theirs in order to escape inquisition or censure.26 But all the concessions which his heart grants to interventionistic thinking concern only secondary matters and the formula- tion of doctrine. Regarding the problem itself, Strigl's per- ceptive analysis comes to no conclusion other than that drawn in scientific economic analysis. The gist of his doc- trine is visible in the sentence: "The greater the service a worker can render, the more he will earn, provided his ser- vice is useful in the economy; it does not matter whether his wage is determined in the free market or agreed upon by collective contract."27 It obviously grieves him that this is so, but he cannot and will not deny it. Strigl emphasizes that artificial wage increases create un- employment. 28 This is undoubtedly the case where wages are raised in individual industries only, or in individual countries only, or where they are raised unevenly in differ- ent industries and countries, or where monetary policies are used to stem a general rise in prices. Undoubtedly Strigl's case is important for an understanding of present-day con- ditions. For a thorough understanding of the problem, how- ever, we must rely upon another basic assumption. To have universal validity our analysis must assume that the rise in wages occurs evenly and simultaneously in different indus- tries and countries, and that monetary factors do not inter- vene. Only then can we completely understand interven- tionism. 25. See Strigl, Angewandte Lohntheorie. Untersuchungen Ã¼ber die wirtschaftlichen Grundlagen der Socialpolitik [Applied wage theory.
