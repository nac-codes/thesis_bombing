nomic policy simply to the spirit of the age surely expect very little from a scien- tific explanation of interventionism. The capitalist spirit is said to have been replaced by the spirit of the hampered economy. Capitalism has grown old and, therefore, must yield to the new. And this new is said to be the economy that is hampered by government and other intervention. Anyone who seriously believes that such statements can re- fute the conclusions of economics regarding the effects of import duties and price controls truly cannot be helped.

But because realization of this postulate of "competition that is really free and equal in conditions" is believed to be the highest objective of economic policy, they suggest various reforms. In the name of the ideal, some are demanding a kind of socialism they call "liberal" because they apparently perceive the essence of liberalism in this ideal. And others are demanding various other interven- tionistic measures. But the economy is no prize contest in which the participants compete under the conditions of the 59  rules of the game. If it is to be determined which horse can run a certain distance in the shortest period of time, the con- ditions should be equal for all horses. However, are we to treat the economy like an efficiency test to determine which applicant under equal conditions can produce at lowest costs? Competition as a social phenomenon has nothing in common with competition in play. It is a terminological confusion to transfer the postulate of "equal conditions" from the rules of sport or from the arrangement of scientific and technological experiments to economic policy. In so- ciety, not only in the capitalist
