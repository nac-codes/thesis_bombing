ons are gener- ated. If, for instance, all import restrictions were lifted today, the greatest difficulties would be evident for a short time, but there would soon be an unprecedented rise in the productivity of human labor. These inevitable frictions can- not be mitigated through an orderly lengthening of the time taken for such a reduction of the protection, nor are they al- ways aggravated by such a lengthening. However, in the case of government interferences with prices, a slow and gradual reduction, when compared with their immediate 4. Lampe, op. cit., p. 127 et seq. 5. Ibid., p. 105. 62 abolition, only prolongs the time during which the undesir- able consequences of the intervention continue to be felt. The two other points of Lampe's "productive interven- tionism" require no special critique. In fact, one of them is not interventionistic, and the other actually aims at its aboli- tion. In the second point of his program, Lampe demands that public authority eliminate the numerous institutional obstacles that stifle the occupational and regional mobility of labor. But this means elimination of all those government and labor union measures that impede mobility. This is ba- sically the old demand of laissez passer, the very opposite of interventionism. And in his third point, Lampe demands that the central political authority gain "an early and de- pendable overview of the whole economic situation," which surely is no intervention. An overview of the economic sit- uation can be useful to everybody, even to government, if the conclusion is reached that there should be no inter- ference at all. When we compare Lampe's interventionistic program with others of a few years ago, we recognize how much more modest the claims of this school have become. This is progress of which the critics of interventionism can be proud. 2.
