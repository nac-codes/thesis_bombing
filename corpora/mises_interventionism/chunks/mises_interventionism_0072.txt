What is essential alone is its position on the problem of private property in the means of production. Inasmuch as the Socialists of the Chair repre- sented etatism, and inasmuch as they demanded the nation- alization of large enterprises and government supervision and control of all other enterprises, they engaged in socialis- tic politics.

Lujo Bren- tano and his School promoted a syndicalistic program, al- though in many questions of daily politics they joined ranks with the other Socialists of the Chair and, together with the Social Democrats, fought against liberalism.

Brentano carefully veiled his position, but nevertheless it was syndicalism. It became visible in his position on the problems of labor union coer- cion and strike, and the protection of workers willing to work.
