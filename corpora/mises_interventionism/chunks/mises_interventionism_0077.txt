Herkner then continues, "If this system could be realized with liberal means, that is, without force and viola- tion of law, and if it could not only improve the material conditions of the people, but also assure a greater measure of individual freedom, then no objection could be raised against it from the liberal point of view." 14 Thus, when Par- liament discusses the question of nationalization, the liber- als, according to Herkner, could vote for the common weal if it is introduced "without force and violation of law" and if it were not for their doubts about the material well-being of the people. Herkner seems to believe that the older liberalism advo- cated private property for its own sake and not for its social consequences. Like Wiese and Zwiedineck, he construes a difference between the older and the contemporary liberal- ism. According to Herkner, "While the older liberalism viewed private property as an institution of natural law 12. Herkner, "Socialpolitischer Liberalismus" [Social liberalism], vol. I, p. 41. 13. Ibid., vol. I, p. 43. 14. Ibid., p. 44. whose protection besides that of individual freedom was the first duty of the state, contemporary liberalism is em- phasizing ever more strongly the social factor in prop- erty. . . .

Modern liberalism, too, is advocating private property on grounds of "social suit- ability." 16 It cannot be our task here to examine how nonliberal theories of natural law meant to defend private property as a natural phenomenon. But it should be
