operty on grounds of "social suit- ability." 16 It cannot be our task here to examine how nonliberal theories of natural law meant to defend private property as a natural phenomenon. But it should be common knowledge that the older liberals were utilitarians (they are frequently criticized for it), and that it was self-evident to them that no social institution and no ethical rule can be advocated for its own sake or for reasons of special interest, but can be de- fended only on grounds of social suitability. It is no indica- tion that liberalism is moving toward socialism if modern liberalism demands private property in the means of pro- duction because of its social utility, and not for its own sake or for the interests of owners. "Private property and inheritance," Herkner continues, "give rise to unearned income. Liberalism sympathizes with the efforts of socialists to oppose this unearned income in the interest of justice and equal opportunity for all mem- bers of society." 17 The fact that unearned income flows from property is as obvious as that poverty comes from pauvreté. In fact, unearned income flows from control over the means of production. He who opposes unearned income must op- pose private property in the means of production. There- fore, a liberal cannot sympathize with such efforts. If he does so nevertheless, he is no longer a liberal. 15. Ibid., p. 49. 16.

I, p. 49. 80 81  What in Herkner's view, then, is liberalism? His answer is this: Liberalism is a world view, a kind of religion, a faith. It is a faith in the natural dignity and goodness of man, in his great destiny, in his ability to grow through his powers of natural reason and freedom, in the victory of justice and truth. Without freedom there is no truth. Without truth there can be no triumph of justice, no progress, thus no develop- ment,
