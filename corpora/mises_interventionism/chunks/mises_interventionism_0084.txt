hypotheses, interpretations, and arguments seek to solve concrete problems. But logic is consistent in every science. It is true also of economics. The Historical-Realistic School itself, which for political reasons disagreed with the traditional and modern theories, proves this point by not substituting its own explanations for the rejected doctrines, but by merely denying the possibility of theoretical knowl- edge. Economic knowledge necessarily leads to liberalism. On the one hand, it demonstrates that there are only two possi- bilities for the property problem of a society based on the division of labor: private property or public property in the means of production. The so-called middle of the road of "regulated" property is either illogical, because it does not lead to the intended goal and accomplishes nothing but a disruption of the capitalistic production process, or it must lead to complete socialization of the means of production. 28.

Therefore, economic knowledge is blocking the way to socialistic and syndicalis- tic ideologies that prevail all over the world. And this ex- plains the war that is waged everywhere against economics and economists. Zwiedineck-Südenhorst seeks to give the untenable doc- trine of the third possible social order a new garb. "We are dealing not only with the institution of property," he in- forms us, but probably more importantly also with the totality of legal standards that form a superstructure over any property order and thereby any economic order.
