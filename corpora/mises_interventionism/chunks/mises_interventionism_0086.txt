he only maintains that protective tariffs do not have the effects the protectionists ascribe to them. And he who rejects price controls for being unsuitable does not deny that govern- ment can impose and supervise them. He merely denies that the controls will lead to the goal which government meant to attain. 5. The Methodenstreit As early as the 1870s Walter Bagehot irrefutably exploded the arguments with which the followers of the Historical School rejected the dependability of "theoretical" inquiries in the field of economics. He called the two methods-the Historical School considered them the only permissible methods-the "all-case method" and the "single-case method." The former works with induction only, and makes the erroneous assumption that this is the road that usually leads the natural sciences to their findings. Bagehot demon- 30.

The "sin- gle-case method," which accepts descriptions of concrete historical data only, fails to realize, according to Bagehot, that there can be no economic history and no economic de- scription "unless there was a considerable accumulation of applicable doctrine before existing." 31 The Methodenstreit has long been decided. Never before has a scientific exchange led to such a crushing defeat of one side. Fortunately, this is freely admitted in Economics After the War. In his contribution on business cycle research, which is based on a thorough knowledge of the material, Löwe briefly touches upon the question of method and skill- fully proves the untenableness of the objections empiricists raise against theory. Unfortunately, we must also agree with Löwe where he observes that "the heresy of 'impartial' data research, which deprived a whole generation of German scholars of its resu
