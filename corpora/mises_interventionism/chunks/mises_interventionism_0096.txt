judgment" only "if we can numerically measure these fine complicated pro- cesses." Adolf Weber sees in such an answer a declaration of bankruptcy of our science. 48 But the etatist need not be concerned with the bankruptcy of catallactics. In fact, the consistent etatist denies the existence of any regularity in the process of market phenomena. At any rate, as politician the etatist knows an escape from the dilemma: the state de- termines the level of wages. But the refutation of the Bren- tano-Webb doctrine alone is not fatal. Even if we were to ac- cept it-which, as we pointed out, no one would dare do since the writings of Adolf Weber, Pohle, and BÃ¶hm-Bawerk -the decisive question would still need an answer. If labor unions actually had the power to raise the average wage of all workers above the rate that would prevail without their intervention, the question remains, How high can wages go? Can average wages go so high that they absorb all "un- earned" income and must be paid out of capital? Or is there a lower limit at which this rise must stop? This is the prob- lem the "power theory" must answer with regard to every price. But until today no one has ever tried to solve the problem. We must not deal with the power problem by calling au- thoritative intervention "impossible," as did older liberal- 47.

There cannot be any doubt that labor unions are in the position to raise wage rates as high as they wish if the state assists them by denying protection to all workers willing to work, and either pays unemployment compensation or forces employers to hire workers. But then the following occurs: The workers in essential enterprises are in the position to extract any arbitrary wage from the rest of the population. But ignoring even that, the shifting of the wage boost to consumer prices can be b
