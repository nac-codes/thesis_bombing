and incessant repeti- tion. The great struggles that shook the Marxian parties-on revisionism, dictatorship, et cetera-were not scientific; they were purely political discussions. The scientific methods used to conduct them were wholly barren in the eyes of every nonscholastic. Only Marx and Engels, not one of their epigones, have affected German science. During the 1870s and 1880s State and Chair Socialism came to power in Germany. Classical economics had left the stage. The Austrians, scorned as eccentrics, were the only writers who contributed to modern economics, which, like Western sociology,* at first remained wholly unknown. Be- sides, both were suspected of Manchesterism. Only histori- cal and descriptive-statistical compositions were permissi- ble, and a "social" conviction, i.e., Socialism of the Chair, was the most important requirement for scholarly recogni- tion. In spite of, and perhaps because of, this affinity, the Socialists of the Chair opposed Social Democracy. They barely paid attention to Marx and Engels, who were consid- ered too "doctrinaire." This began to change when a new generation came along, pupils of the men who, in 1872, had founded the Associa- tion for Social Policy. This generation had never been ex- posed to university lectures on theoretical economics. It knew the classical economists by name only and was con- vinced that they had been vanquished by Schmoller. Very few had ever read or even seen the works of Ricardo or Mill. But they had to read Marx and Engels, which became all the more necessary as they had to cope with the growing Social Democracy. They were writing books in order to refute Marx. As a result of such efforts, they themselves, and their readers, fell under the influence of Marxian ideas. Because of their ignorance in all economic and sociological theory, they were utterly defenseless against the doctrines of Marx. They rejected the harshest political demands of Marx and Engels, but adopted the theories in milder
