The fact that the conditions cooperate harmoniously only signifies that they lead to the effect we are to explain. If we desist from calling a given state of affairs "good," all tenets of the doc- trine stay intact. The explanation of how a certain state "nec- essarily" had to result from given conditions that cannot be analyzed further, is independent of how we may value this state. The attacks on the thought of "preestablished har- mony" do not touch the substance, merely the wording, of the utilitarian social theory. Without change in substance, the social doctrine of Marx- ism, too, can be understood as one announcing a preestab- lished harmony. The dialectics of social reality necessarily lead the way from the primeval world to the goal, the social- istic paradise. The unsatisfactory part of this doctrine is its content; the wording again is unimportant. The opponents of utilitarian social theory like to taunt it for its "rationalism." But every scientific explanation is ra- tionalistic. Whatever the human mind cannot comprehend, the tools of science cannot conquer. This criticism often ig- nores the fact that liberal social theory does not explain formation and progress of social ties and institutions as con- sciously aimed human efforts toward the formation of soci- eties, as the naive versions of the contract theory explain them.

We can either hold to th
