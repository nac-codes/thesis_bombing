But he who adheres to the former embraces the doctrine that the private property order serves the interests of all members of society, not just those of owners. 12 We proceed from the position that there are no insoluble conflicts of interest within the private property order, even to the recognition that warlike behavior becomes rarer as the scope and intensity of social association grows. Wars, foreign and domestic (revolutions, civil wars), are more likely to be avoided the closer the division of labor binds men.
