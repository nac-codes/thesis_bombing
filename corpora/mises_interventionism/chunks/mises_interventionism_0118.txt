Wieser's critique of the rationalistic-utilitarian doctrine in general, and of Menger's formulation in particular, leaves its substance untouched (See Wieser, Theorie der gesellschaftlichen Wirtschaft [Theory of social economics], TÃ¼bingen, 1914, sec. I, p. 242 et seq.). Its significance lies in its distinction between leader and masses-probably under the influence of Tarde-and in its greater emphasis on the principle of heterogeneity of objectives-as Wundt called it. 12.
