Marxism thus swayed German thought in sociology and philosophy of history. Popular German sociology adopted, above all, the class concept that is so basic to Marxian sociology.

Each class knows precisely what its class interests are and how to real- ize them. Therefore, there can only be warfare, or at best an a
