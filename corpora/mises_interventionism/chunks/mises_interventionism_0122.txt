class movements of the bourgeoisie. The fact that the principalities prevailed over the 1848 rebels in Germany is hailed as most fortunate, as it paved the way for the social rule of the Hohenzollern kai- sers standing above classes and parties. To German etatists and Marxists, the modern imperialism of the allied powers springs from the capitalistic propensity to expand. The etat- ists also adopted a good part of the Marxian superstructure theory when they depicted classical economics as a hand- maiden of the class interests of entrepreneurs and the bour- geoisie. An example given above illustrates how this ap- plied even to Schmoller. It should be noted that no critical examination preceeded the adoption of the basic Marxian doctrines. The attention of etatists was directed primarily at blunting the Marxian at- tack on the state ideology and its political offshoots during Prussian leadership in Germany, and at rendering the Marx- ian doctrines useful for the ideas of state socialism and con- servatism.

In politics they contented themselves with charg- ing Marxism with exaggerations, and sought to demonstrate that there is yet another solution, indeed, a better solution: social reform. Their main attack on Marxism did not aim at its economic program, but at its political program: it placed class interests above national interests.

His new work, which af- forded me the occasion for this essay, provides me with the opportunity to deal with him in detail. Dependence on Marx is the special characteristic of Ger- man social sciences. Surely Marxism has left its traces as well on the social thinking of France, Great Britain, the United States, the Scandin
