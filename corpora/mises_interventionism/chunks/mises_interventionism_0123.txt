Dependence on Marx is the special characteristic of Ger- man social sciences. Surely Marxism has left its traces as well on the social thinking of France, Great Britain, the United States, the Scandinavian countries, and the Nether- lands. But the influence that emanated from Marxian doc- trines was incomparably greater in Germany. The fact that the sociology of utilitarianism was generally rejected in Ger- many undoubtedly offers an explanation for this great in- fluence. 15 In Italy also, the influence of Marxism was rather significant, although not so strong as in Germany.
