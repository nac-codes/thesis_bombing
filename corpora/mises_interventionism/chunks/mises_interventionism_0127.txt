ing the nineteenth century, grew from a worldwide shifting of production to areas with more favorable production con- ditions. If there had been complete freedom of movement, a part of the German population would have emigrated, for German agriculture and some branches of industry could no longer compete with newly opened, more fertile countries offering more favorable production conditions. For national political reasons Germany sought to prevent this emigration through tariff policies. We cannot elaborate here why this attempt was doomed to failure. 19 The migration problem is the third form of the practical political problem for Germany. Germany lacks territory for its excess population. And again, the prewar theory of Ger- man nationalism discovered no better solution than vio- lence through conquest of suitable territory. In Europe, tens of millions of people live poorly who would do much better in America and Australia. The differ- ence in the living conditions between a European and his descendants overseas continues to grow. European emi- grants could find overseas what their native countries failed to offer: a place at the banquet of nature. But they are too late. The descendants of those who, one, two, or three generations ago chose the New World over Europe, do not welcome them. The organized laborers of the United States and the British Commonwealth countries permit no addi- tion of new competitors. Their labor union movement is not aimed at employers, as the Marxian doctrine prescribes; they are waging their "class war" against European workers whose immigration would reduce the marginal productivity of labor, and thus wage rates. The labor unions of the An- glo-Saxon countries favored participation in the Great War in order to eliminate the last remnants of the liberal doctrine of free movement and migration of labor. This was their war objective, which they adhered to completely. Countless Germans living abroad were uprooted, deprived of their posses
