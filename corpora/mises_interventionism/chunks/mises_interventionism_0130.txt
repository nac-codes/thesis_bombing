foreign policy. Its program for the integra- tion of the German nation in the world economy and world policy does not basically differ from the precept of German policy in recent decades. In fact, it does not differ from re- cent policy more than any theoretical doctrine differs from the realities faced by the statesman who is kept from his in- tended course by his daily tasks. But a violent solution is even less applicable today than it was in prewar Germany. Even a victorious Germany would be powerless to face the real problems of the German nation. In the present state of world affairs, Germany could never prevail over the oppos- ing national interests of other nations, that is, it could not acquire overseas territory for German settlement and open up favorable markets for German industry.

They must demand full economic freedom because every intervention in the hands of the foreign state becomes a means of discrim- ination against the German population. 22 But how can the German population in the border territories fight for democ- racy and economic freedom if the Reich itself conducts a contrary policy? National Anti-Marxism has also failed on scientific grounds.
