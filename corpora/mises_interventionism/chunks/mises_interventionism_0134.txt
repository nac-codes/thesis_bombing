Proletarianism, ac- cording to Sombart, merely rejects the social form, not the gist of modern civilization. And with clear emphasis on his own position he confronts proletarian socialism with the "preproletarian chimera," with its "bucolic" flavor which always praised agriculture as the most noble vocation and looked upon agrarian culture as its ideal. 26 This infatuation with agrarian society and the Middle Ages deserves our comment. We meet it again and again in the literature of nationalistic Anti-Marxism, with variations by individual authors. For Spann, the leader of this move- ment, the ideal was a return to the Middle Ages. 27 He who depicts the social institutions and economic or- ganizations of the Middle Ages as models for the German people, should be aware that a bucolic Germany could sup- port only a fraction of the present population even with the greatest curtailment of expectations. Every proposal that would reduce the productivity of labor diminishes the sup- portable population, and, through the deterioration of the apparatus of production, would weaken the national de- fenses that are so important from a nationalistic point of view. Nor can nationalism seek a solution of the German problem in a return to an agrarian society. The incompatibil- ity of the bucolic ideals with a powerful development of na- tional forces may explain the dark pessimism of the "doom theories" that are springing up in various forms. If it should be true that the particular ethos of the German nation is demanding a return to production methods that lead to lower labor productivity, and that, inversely, the Western nations, the Latin nations of the South, and Slavic nations in the East think differently
