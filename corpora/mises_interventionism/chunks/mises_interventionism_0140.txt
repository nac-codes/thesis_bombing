of Marxism. And he draws practical conclusions other than those of orthodox Marxists. In fact, he does not oppose so- cialism in any form. Sombart reproaches Marx not for his doctrine of class war- fare, but for its politicalization and the final conclusion Marx draws from the doctrine: the inevitability of the prole- tarian victory.36 In other words, Sombart does not say that the Marxian separation of classes does not exist, or that the properly understood interests of the various layers of popu- lation working in a division of labor do not conflict with each other, but are harmonious. But he says: Ethics must overcome the conflict of class interests. Besides the class principle "there are other social principles-namely those of idealistic nature." But Marxism makes the class concept ab- solute. 37 Sombart apparently believes that man must sub- merge his class interests and give precedence to higher interests, to national interests. He reproaches the Marxists for not thinking in terms of fatherland, for conducting world policies, for advocating class warfare in domestic policies, and for remaining pacifistic and antinationalistic in foreign policies. Sombart completely ignores the scientific criticism of the Marxian class doctrine. This is necessary because he wants to ignore utilitarianism and economic theory and because, in the final analysis, he considers Marxism as the true science of capitalism. According to Sombart, "Marx founded ... the science of capitalism."38 Long ago this science "demonstrated conclusively, that this economic order con- tains the essence of the destruction and dissolution of civili- zation. Karl Marx was the greatest, if not the first, harbinger of this knowledge." 39 In order to escape the conclusions that 36. Ibid., vol. I, p. 368 et seq. 37. Ibid., vol. I, p. 356. 38. Ibid., vol.
