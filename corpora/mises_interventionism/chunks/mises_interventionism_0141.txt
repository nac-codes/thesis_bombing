Sombart is quite right when he professes that it is not the function of science to provide a "value critique, that is, to reveal the inferiority of individual words, analyses, and principles of proletarian socialism." But he is mistaken when he declares that scientific critique is "but a discovery of relationships and their significance, relationships not only between the various doctrines and corresponding polit- ical demands, but also between the content of the whole system and the basic questions of intellectual civilization and human fate."40 That is the position of historicism which is content with pursuing relationships among scien- tific theories and between scientific theories and metaphys- ical systems of thought, but abstains from developing scientific theories of its own. A sociological theory, which Marxism represents in spite of its shortcomings, can be an- alyzed only by examining its usefulness for an explanation of social phenomena. And it can be replaced only with a theory that is more satisfactory.41 It could not be otherwise. Sombart's critique of proletar- ian socialism rests on a subjective value judgment of what he considers the "basic values" of the proletariat. Here, world view meets world view, metaphysics confronts meta- physics. It is confession, not perception, and has no bearing on science. Of course, there are many readers who appre- ciate Sombart's work for this very reason. It does not limit itself to the narrow field of scientific labor, but offers meta- physical syntheses. It is not mere scientific research, but the presentation of material permeated with the spirit and per- sonality of the man and thinker, Sombart. This is what gives the book its character and sign
