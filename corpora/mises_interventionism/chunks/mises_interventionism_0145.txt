Only he who can see the world without Marxian blinders may ap- proach the great problems of sociology. Only when German science has freed itself from the Marxian errors in which it is enmeshed today, then, and only then, will the power of Marxist slogans disappear from political life. 42. C.

Government is called upon to create order because disorder and arbitrariness prevail. The practical doctrine based on the knowledge of scien- tific economics and sociology-liberalism-rejects all inter- vention as superfluous, useless, and harmful. It is super- fluous because built-in forces are at work that limit the arbitrariness of the exchanging parties. It is useless because the government objective of lower pric
