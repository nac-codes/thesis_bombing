eneral wage boost has given the workers a share of entre- preneurial profits and capital income. The workers' real raise is visible in that prices do not rise by the full amount of the wage boost because of the entrepreneurs' and capital- ists' cutback in consumption. That is, the rise in consumer prices is less than that of wages. But it is well known that even if all property income were divided among the work- ers, their individual incomes would rise very little, which should dispel any illusion about such a reduction in prop- erty income. But if we were to assume that the wage boost and rise in prices should allocate a large part, if not all, of the real income of entrepreneurs and capitalists to workers, we must bear in mind that the former want to live and will therefore consume their capital for lack of entrepreneurial income. Elimination of capital income through coercive wage boosts thus merely leads to capital consumption, and thereby to continuous reduction in national income. (By the way, every attempt at abolishing capital income must have the same consequence unless it is achieved through all- round nationalization of production and consumption.) If again government seeks to avoid these undesirable effects, no alternative is left, from the etatist point of view, but to seize control over the means of production from the owners. Our discussion applies only to those price controls that endeavor to set prices differing from those of the un- hampered market. If the controls should seek to undercut monopolistic prices, the consequences are quite differ- ent. Government then may effectively intervene anywhere 2. We are ignoring the monetary forces' exerting their influence on prices. 149  in the range between the higher monopolistic price and the lower competitive price. Under certain conditions price con- trols may deprive a monopolist of specific monopolistic gains. Let us assume, for instance, that in an isolated econ- omy a sugar cartel is holding sugar
