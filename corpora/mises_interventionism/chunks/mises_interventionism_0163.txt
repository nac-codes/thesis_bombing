from that of the public. He is convinced that people should spend their money differently. Many would agree with him. But from this difference in taste Deumer draws the conclusion that a so- cialistic command system should be established through na- tionalization of credit, so that public consumption can be re- directed. On this we must disagree with Deumer. Guided by central authority according to central plan, a socialistic economy can be democratic or dictatorial. A de- mocracy in which the central authority depends on public support through ballots and elections cannot proceed differ- ently from the capitalistic economy. It will produce and dis- tribute what the public likes, that is, alcohol, tobacco, trash in literature, on the stage, and in the cinema, and fashion- able frills. The capitalistic economy, however, caters as well to the taste of a few consumers. Goods are produced that are demanded by some consumers, and not by all. The demo- cratic command economy with its dependence on popular majority need not consider the special wishes of the minor- ity. It will cater exclusively to the masses. But even if it is managed by a dictator who, without consideration for the wishes of the public, enforces what he deems best, who clothes, feeds, and houses the people as he sees fit, there is no assurance that he will do what appears proper to "us." The critics of the capitalistic order always seem to believe that the socialistic system of their dreams will do precisely what they think correct. While they may not always count on becoming dictators themselves, they are hoping that the dictator will not act without first seeking their advice. Thus they arrive at the popular contrast of productivity and profit- ability. They call "productive" those economic actions they deem correct. And because things may be different at times they reject the capitalistic order which is guided by profit- ability and the wishes of consumers, the true masters of markets and production.
