But it must be borne in mind that the loss shown by commercial account- ing is offset by public services that are not visible in the ac- counts. For instance, dollars and cents cannot express our achievements in the preservation of small and medium en- terprises, in the improvements of the material conditions of the 'backbone' classes of population." Under such condi- tions the profitability of an enterprise loses significance. If public management is to be audited at all, it must be judged with the yardstick of bureaucratism. Management must be regimented, and positions must be filled with individuals who are willing to obey the regulations. No matter how we may search, it is impossible to find a form of organization that could prevent the strictures of bu- reaucratism in public enterprises. It won't do to observe that many large corporations have become "bureaucratic" in re- cent decades. It is a mistake to believe that this is the result of size. Even the biggest enterprise remains immune to the dangers of bureaucratism as long as it aims exclusively at 5. Ibid., p. 184. 160 161  profitability. True, if other considerations are forced on it, it loses the essential characteristic of a capitalistic enter- prise. It was the prevailing etatistic and interventionistic policies that forced large enterprises to become more and more bureaucratic.

They were forced to con- tinue operations they wished to abandon, and merge with companies and plants they did not want. The mixing of pol- itics and business not only is detrimental to politics, as is frequently observed, but even much more so to business. Many large enterprises must give thousands of considera- tions to political matters, which plants the seeds of bureau-
