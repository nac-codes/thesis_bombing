It would be too weak to resist the clamor of credit applicants. But the bank- ing system is to be nationalized, in Deumer's words, "to pay heed to the complaints of small industrial enterprises and many commercial firms that they are able to secure the necessary credits only with great difficulties and much sac- rifice." 7 A few years ago it would have been necessary to elaborate the consequences of credit expansion. There is no need for such an effort today. The relationship between credit expan- sion and rising goods prices and foreign exchange rates is well known today. This has been brought out not only by the research of some economists, but also by the American and British experiences and theories with which Germans have become familiar. It would be superfluous to elaborate further on this. 6. Ibid., p. 152 et seq. 7. Ibid., p. 184. 162 163  4. Summation Deumer's book clearly reveals that etatism, socialism, and interventionism have run their course. Deumer is unable to support his proposals with anything but the old etatist and Marxian arguments which have been refuted a hundred times. He simply ignores the critique of these arguments. Nor does he consider the problems that arose from recent socialistic experience. He still takes his stand on the ground of an ideology that welcomes every nationalization as prog- ress, even though it has been shaken to its foundations in recent years. Politics, therefore, will ignore Deumer's book, which may be regrettable from the author's viewpoint because he in- vested labor, ingenuity, and expertise in his proposals. But in the interest of a healthy recovery of the German economy, it is gratifying. 164
