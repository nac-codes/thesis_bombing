By tracing the complex interrelationships of these four causal factors, this study provides a greater understanding of the origins and rise to dominance of American strategic bombing theory.  Thus, it aids in understanding the process of how new technologies spur fresh thinking that offer potentially revolutionary new strategies.

I am grateful for the help, guidance, and support of many individuals in the pursuit of this dissertation.  I know this short list can never be complete, and I apologize for anyone who may be overlooked in this formal thank you.    I want to start out with my dissertation advisor Dr. William Trimble.  Bill has been a complete joy to work with from the start of my time at Auburn.  He took a green Air Force lieutenant colonel on a short timeline and with only a general concept of a dissertation topic and guided him along a path to ensure not only graduation, but also a relevant research effort.  His keen guidance and tireless efforts to improve my substandard grammar are deeply appreciated.  The other members of my committee also deserve high praise.  Dr. Alan Meyer, Dr. Mark Sheftall, and Dr. David Carter proved outstanding teachers, mentors, and friends.  Each played a large role in shaping my thoughts on how outside influences affected the evolution of strategic bombing theory during the often-chaotic World War I and interwar eras.  A special thank you goes to Dr. Alan Meyer for his many coffee breaks with me, where he helped this tired old military officer understand the academic process and keep him on track in his studies.  Next, I must mention the informal member of my dissertation committee, Mr. Thomas Wildenberg.  On countless occasions, Tomâ€™s expert subject matter knowledge and kindly guidance helped keep me on track.  I am deeply indebted to him for constantly  File: --- morris_origins.
