These initial aircraft represented the beginning of a massive buildup of American combat air power in Europe.  Less than a month earlier, on 24 April 1942, Maj. Gen. Carl Spaatz had provided the strategic direction for these bombers when he established the headquarters 8th Air Force just thirty miles away at Bushy Park.1  At the time, the 8th commanded only a bomber group, a fighter group, and a transportation group, but these initial forces foreshadowed the rise of the “Mighty Eighth” into the formidable air fleets that attacked the Nazi war machine. While the deployment of the first bomber group to England may seem like the beginning of an epic history, in one way it was the end of another narrative.  The establishment of the 8th Air Force represented the fruition of a generation of air power dreamers stretching back to World War I.  This vision centered on one idea: aircraft could forever change the nature of warfare.  In the minds of forward thinking aerial theorists this new technology removed the limitations of geography, defenses, and operational reach that had restricted ground and naval forces since the dawn of human conflict.                                                   1 Geoffrey Perret, Winged Victory: The Army Air Forces in World War II (New York: Random House, 1993), 240.
