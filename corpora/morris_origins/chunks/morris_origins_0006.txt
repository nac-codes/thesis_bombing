was evident in the first Air Service doctrinal manual written by Maj. William C. Sherman in 1921.  He wrote, “In deriving the doctrine that must underlie all principles of employment of the air force, we must not be guided by conditions  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 9 --- 3 surrounding the use of ground troops, but must seek out our doctrine…in the element in which the air force operates.”2 Perhaps this viewpoint helps explain some of the confusion in the study of early American air power.  For decades, historical accounts sought to explain how the two elements of Air Service doctrine interrelated to form the Army Air Corps and then after World War II the independent Air Force.  In this light, historians sought individuals who advocated both an independent air force and strategic bombing as the raison d'être for that service’s existence.  Hence, William “Billy” Mitchell and Benjamin Foulois appear as the most important actors in early Air Service history, as they both shaped and combined independence and strategic bombing. There are three major problems with this approach.  First, it falls victim to what David Hackett Fischer called the historian’s fallacy, where authors assume future leaders fully understood and worked towards historical outcomes.3  For instance, because World War II saw a mostly independent Army Air Forces committed to strategic bombing, then its founders must have been early advocates of both.  Next, the traditional approach often obscures other truly important figures who do not quite fit the stereotypical mold.  The attention given to Mitchell and Foulois hides the work of quieter, less well known, but truly innovative thinkers.  Finally, the approach misses the importance of social factors in shaping the thinking of the men who created strategic bombing and the organizations that implemented the concept.                                                   2 Robert F.
