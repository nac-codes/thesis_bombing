Instead, the complex interaction among air power theorists, technological changes, organizational dynamics, and political realities shaped the evolution and eventual ascension of strategic bombing as the air power doctrine of the United States.  This was not a linear progression and was in no way preordained.  As late as 1938, the status of strategic bombing was highly in doubt with the purchase of heavy bombers all but stopped and strategic bombing theory largely limited to the backwaters of the Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) in Montgomery, Alabama. Unfortunately, this muddier storyline often conflicts with the Air Force’s own vision of its past and the historian’s search for primary causal factors.  This divergence can be seen in both the original explanations for the success of strategic bombing and the recent revisions of those assessments.  While each approach has value, they all tend to downplay varied aspects of bombing’s evolution in favor of a preferred causal factor.  By doing so, however, these academic studies miss the larger interplay among men, technology, organizations, money, and politics.  They rob the reader of both the true story of strategic bombing and the greater understanding of how different elements mesh to transform technologies into military strategies.   Mostly written from the 1950s to the 1980s, the early strategic bombing analyses largely follow the then widely accepted linear p
