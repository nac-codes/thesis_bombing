nt elements mesh to transform technologies into military strategies.   Mostly written from the 1950s to the 1980s, the early strategic bombing analyses largely follow the then widely accepted linear progression storyline.  By doing so, they depict bombing’s rise as an unstoppable force that was at least partially choreographed by the central players.  This is clearly observable in the early histories of American aviation in World War I and the interwar years.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 11 --- 5 Four foundational books combine to depict this linear evolution.  First, Air Force historian Maurer Maurer’s U.S. Air Service in World War I sets the stage by depicting the British influence over key aviation figures as the catalysts for using aircraft to attack an enemy’s industrial system.  Retired general and military historian I. B. Holley’s Ideas and Weapons: Exploitation of the Aerial Weapon by the United States during World War I: A Study in the Relationship of Technological Advance, Military Doctrine, and the Development of Weapons supports the linear history with his argument that aviation’s unfulfilled promise during World War I guided American aviation thought in the interwar years, as Mitchell pushed for increases in bomber production, the strategic use of air power, and Air Service independence.  Robert Futrell’s Ideas, Concepts, and Doctrines: Basic Thinking in the United States Air Force, 1907-1964 takes up where Holley leaves off.  Futrell portrays the interwar years as a competition for dominance between the Army and its Air Corps where the lessons of World War I merged with the technological advances of the interwar years to push air power towards a doctrine based on strategic attack.  Finally, Robert Finney’s History of the Air Corps Tactical School, 1920-1940 describes the mechanism for the ascension of strategic bombing through the lectures, theoretical debates, and officer interactions at the Air Corps’ doctrinal training ground.
