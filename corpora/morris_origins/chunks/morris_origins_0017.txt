actly were the roles and missions for aircraft in the Army?  How should the aviation section organize itself to conduct those missions?  Was the technology on hand sufficient?  These were all questions that had largely been ignored in his zeal to get into the air.  As the events of March 19 combined with Gorrell’s other experiences in Mexico, he began to question the preparedness of both himself and his squadron for military operations.  Gorrell was not alone in this self-reflection.  Newspaper reporting from Mexico indicated that most pilots had similar concerns.  Even the 1st Aero Squadron commander, Capt. Benjamin Foulois, submitted multiple critiques of the equipment, organization, and usage of the squadron during the campaign.5  Thus, the unit's experience in the Mexican Punitive Expedition was an alarm clock waking up not only the Air Service, but also the Signal Corps, Army leadership, and eventually Congress to the problems facing America’s flying forces on the eve of their entry into World War I.   In this way, Gorrell’s own experience before, during, and immediately following Mexico represents a metaphor for larger trends in the fledgling Air Service.  His personnel reflections provide insights into the thinking, organizational difficulties, and technology concerns facing the young aviators.  The solutions developed by these pioneers laid the technological, organizational, and doctrinal foundations that future strategic bombing advocates built upon when the United States entered World War I in April 1917.                                                    5 Capt.
