File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 21 --- 15 Shaping the Man: West Point to Mexico (1912-1916)  Edgar Staley Gorrell was born in Baltimore on 3 February 1891.  By all accounts, he was a smart, quiet lad with a knack for numbers and a keen sense of exploration.  This combination of intelligence and adventurism served him well when he entered Baltimore City College at the tender age of thirteen.  Yet, young Gorrell’s sense of adventure pushed him towards a military career.  In February 1908, he joined the freshman class at the United States Military Academy.  Classmates remember him as slender and a bit shy, but they also noted he was an avid sportsman and a surprisingly good athlete.

On that morning, he joined his classmates on a hill overlooking the Hudson River as they waited for Glenn Curtiss to pilot his airplane from Albany to New York.  As the group cheered, Curtiss struggled to keep his aircraft aloft in the turbulent air over the river valley.6  Gorrell stood mesmerized by the spectacle of Curtiss’s flight, the longest city-to-city flight so far.  Captured in this moment was everything Gorrell hoped for, the thrill of flying, the adventure of a new frontier, and the technical challenge of aeronautics.  From that point on, Gorrell determined to seek a career in aviation.  Army rules at the time required West Point graduates to serve two years in combat arms before they could transfer to support assignments.
