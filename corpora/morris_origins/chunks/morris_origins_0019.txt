There he spent an undistinguished couple of years as a junior officer in Company L of the 30th Infantry before seeking reassignment to the Signal Corps.7  His dreams of flight finally came true with his transfer to the Aviation Section in December 1914.  The eager lieutenant arrived at Coronado, California, later that month itching to learn how to fly.  Gorrell joined a growing list of Air Service pioneers trained at the military’s west coast center for aviation on North Island, next to Coronado and across the bay from San Diego.

The 1st started its life in September 1914 at North Island, but quickly deployed to Galveston, Texas, as part of the Army’s response to strained relations with Mexico.  When tensions on the border did not explode into fighting in 1915, the 1st Aero Squadron moved to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, for better flying and weather conditions.  While at Fort Sill, the squadron received their new Curtiss JN-3 aircraft.  The JN-3 proved underpowered and difficult to fly.  After several accidents with injuries, many of the artillery officers designated as spotters refused to fly unless “during war a
