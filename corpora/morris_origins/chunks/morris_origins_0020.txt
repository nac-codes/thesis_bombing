iss JN-3 aircraft.  The JN-3 proved underpowered and difficult to fly.  After several accidents with injuries, many of the artillery officers designated as spotters refused to fly unless “during war and in the case of absolute necessity.”9    Gorrell entered this atmosphere of increased tensions with Mexico and disappointment with aircraft performance when he joined the 1st Aero Squadron shortly                                                 7 Edgar S.

By the time Gorrell arrived, the squadron was hard at work building an airfield and training.10  Unfortunately, the manual labor disrupted the pilots’ training schedules, leaving Gorrell and his compatriots less than fully prepared when instability along the Mexican border once again flared up.    On 9 March 1916, men under the command of Francisco “Pancho” Villa raided the town of Columbus, New Mexico, killing seventeen Americans.  The United States government responded swiftly by ordering Brig. Gen. John J. Pershing to lead a force of 15,000 troops into Mexico to capture or kill Villa.11  Pershing took what was then a radical position in his plan for the expedition.  He decided to use mechanization to make up for the lack of railroad support along the border and in northern Mexico.  Pershing planned to rely on trucks for transportation and resupply of his combined cavalry and infantry forces.   Meanwhile, he looked to the new mechanical marvels of aircraft for a two-fold mission.  First, Pershing understood that the 1st Aero Squadron could aid his units in searching for Villa’s troops in the vast desert region.  Aircraft offered mobility and reconnaissance at speeds and distances beyond anything his cavalry formations could achieve.  Second, aircraft offe
