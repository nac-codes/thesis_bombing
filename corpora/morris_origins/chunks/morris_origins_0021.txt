arching for Villa’s troops in the vast desert region.  Aircraft offered mobility and reconnaissance at speeds and distances beyond anything his cavalry formations could achieve.  Second, aircraft offered a means of communication with swift-moving independent cavalry formations.  If these new mechanical contraptions could search for Mexican bandits, they could also find U.S. Army columns operating independently.  The pilots would then land with critical messages from the expedition commander and return with up-to-date reports from the field.  This system promised a good backup for the early                                                 10 Ibid., 13. 11 Ibid., 10.

Thus, a day later on 10 March 1916, Foulois, as the 1st Aero Squadron’s commander, received word that his unit would join Pershing’s expedition.12  Foulois understood the underprepared condition of his squadron and the harsh terrain they would operate in, but he also knew this was an important moment for air power to prove its worth in combat conditions.  It was a monumental endeavor to deploy the aircraft, operate from remote locations, and most important keep the squadron supplied.  Luckily, Foulois had Gorrell as his combined adjutant and supply officer.  Between 10 and 12 March, Gorrell oversaw the acquisition of $19,000 in parts and ten new trucks to haul the unit’s men and equipment.  The trucks included seven new Jeffrey “Quad” one and a half ton, four-wheel drive trucks, and three others leased from local businesses in San Antonio.13  This proved fortuitous as the 1st Aero Squadron arrived in theater as the only American unit fully mechanized with not only aircraft, but also trucks to transport the fuel, equipment, and personnel required to keep the airplanes flying.   Gorrell’s efforts prepared the squadron in just two short days.  When orders a
