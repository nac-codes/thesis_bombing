t only aircraft, but also trucks to transport the fuel, equipment, and personnel required to keep the airplanes flying.   Gorrell’s efforts prepared the squadron in just two short days.  When orders arrived on 12 March 1916, the 1st Aero Squadron left by rail for Columbus, with eight aircraft, eleven officers, eighty-two enlisted men, and ten trucks.14  By the time they arrived on the fifteenth, the ground forces had already left in two columns for Mexico.  This late arrival meant Foulois could not coordinate his unit’s first flights with the ground column commanders directly.  Yet, it did not hinder the squadron for long.  The unit immediately uncrated its aircraft and prepared for support missions.  Just a day later, on                                                 12 Ibid., 13. 13 Ibid., 14-16. 14 Foulois, “Report of the Operations,” 1-2.

The 1st Aero Squadron’s early contributions were not just in the air.  Logistics problems plagued Pershing as he hunted for Villa.  The trucks Gorrell bought before leaving San Antonio became a rare commodity in the confusion of the expedition’s advance.  Gorrell often drew double duty flying on one day and commanding truck convoys on another.  For instance, on 15 March he led a truck convoy bringing replacement officers and supplies to Las Palomas, Mexico.  Gorrell remembered the day in a later article, “what an experience it was, driving this original truck train into unfriendly territory, with a guard consisting of airplane mechanics.”15  Yet, once again the 1st Aero Squadron was splitting its duties when it should have been focusing on its primary mission of flying.  Why were untrained mechanics serving as convoy security?  Why was an extremely rare quantity, a qualified pilot, traipsing about the desert leading truck convoys?  Thes
