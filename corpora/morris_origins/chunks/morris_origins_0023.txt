its primary mission of flying.  Why were untrained mechanics serving as convoy security?  Why was an extremely rare quantity, a qualified pilot, traipsing about the desert leading truck convoys?  These distractions likely played a role in the troubles that beset Gorrell and the squadron.  At the same time, they underscored the immaturity of the command structure, doctrine, and technology of the squadron and fledgling U.S. Army Air Service.    Shaping the Service   The problems facing Gorrell and his fellow pilots in Mexico were not overnight developments.  These issues were the result of a long string of decisions made at many levels.  As aircraft became a functioning part of the Army, a myriad of political, economic, and service culture issues shaped the early development of military aviation.                                                   15 Edgar S.

Thus, the birth and infancy of military aviation represents a long, almost flat trajectory on the learning curve from roughly 1903 until the formal organization of a controlling staff function and a training school in 1912.   During this period, important decisions occurred in both the Army and Congress that proved instrumental in shaping military aviation.  These decisions related to three areas: funding, technology, and organization.  Not all of the judgments were military related or even made for military concerns, yet they combined to shape the early Air
