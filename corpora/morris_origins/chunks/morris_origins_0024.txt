se decisions related to three areas: funding, technology, and organization.  Not all of the judgments were military related or even made for military concerns, yet they combined to shape the early Air Service with long-lasting effects.  Perhaps the greatest of issue was funding.  From the start, military aviation suffered from a lack of adequate finances.  While part of this related to the general dearth of military spending, other factors also played important roles.  Most notably, military aviation suffered from congressional and public outrage after the failure of Dr. Samuel P. Langley’s Great Aerodrome.  In 1898, the U.S. War Department’s Board of Ordnance and Fortification granted $50,000 to the Smithsonian director to develop a heavier-than-air flying machine.17  Unfortunately, his abject failure in 1903 created a backlash in both the newspapers and Congress questioning how the Army could spend so much with so                                                 16 Charles deForest Chandler and Frank P.

The intense political pressure made the Army reluctant to provide any further money for aviation research.  This policy effectively shifted developmental cost to the early pioneers of aircraft building.    While it is impossible to calculate how long the requirement for self-funding delayed aircraft development, it did create other long-term effects.  Beside any delays in technology, the requirement also created a mentality towards funding that plagued early aviators.  For example, after acceptance of the Wright machine, the Army tasked a single pilot, then Lt. Benjamin Foulois, to take eight enlisted mechanics, one aircraft, and $150 to San Antonio and “teach yourself to fly and evaluate the mili
