the Wright machine, the Army tasked a single pilot, then Lt. Benjamin Foulois, to take eight enlisted mechanics, one aircraft, and $150 to San Antonio and “teach yourself to fly and evaluate the military possibilities of aviation.”18  These interesting orders stemmed from the aforementioned Army policy of not creating separate funding lines for experimental programs in the wake of the Langley fiasco.  As Foulois’s budget came from the Signal Corps’ operations allocation, it in effect equated to what was available after the branch paid for its normal communications support functions.    This funding issue cannot be solely laid at the feet of the Army though.  As Lieutenant Foulois continued to make strides in Texas, his leadership in the Signal Corps began to take notice.  The Chief Signal Officer, Gen. James Allen, requested $200,000 for aviation in both 1910 and 1911, including a request for the purchase of twenty new aircraft.  Yet, despite growing public pressure from aviation enthusiasts, Congress refused to create a separate allocation for aviation.  Instead, congress continued to fund aeronautics through the Signal Corps’ general operating account of $250,000 annually.19                                                  18 Benjamin  D.

The budget issues exacerbated another problem for the early air service: technology.  With barely enough money to keep aircraft flying, there was little thought of improving aircraft design for military usage.  Instead, technological change occurred through trial and error as the mechanics and pilots identified modifications that could be made in the field to improve their ability to train a
