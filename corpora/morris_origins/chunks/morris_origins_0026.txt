military usage.  Instead, technological change occurred through trial and error as the mechanics and pilots identified modifications that could be made in the field to improve their ability to train and participate in public demonstrations.  Foulois’s own memoir describes one of these technological innovations.  Almost immediately after arriving in San Antonio, he determined that the catapult-sled launching system for the Wright airplane hindered his freedom of action.  Foulois preferred a system that would allow him to land and take off from any level field.  He worked feverishly to devise a tricycle landing gear to alleviate the need to reposition the ramp for each flight.  Yet, by this time Foulois had long ago spent his $150 budget on replacement parts after several minor accidents.20  Hence, he was forced to delay the installation of the technological improvement until after the Signal Corps made new funds available. Finally, the treatment of aeronautics as a low-budget experimentation created organizational and staffing issues that hindered early military aviation.  Not only did the Signal Corps have a tiny budget to share, it was also a small branch within the larger Army.  In 1908, the Signal Corps consisted of only 118 officers filling staff duties in Washington, support responsibilities at all major bases, and operational requirements in three field companies.21                                                   20 Foulois, From the Wright Brothers, 75. 21 “Report of the Chief Signal Officer to the Secretary of War” (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1908), 6-7.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 29 --- 23 This paucity of manpower meant the Signal Corps had to look to other branches to provide pilots.  Initially, this took the form of temporary duty assignments.  The unsatisfactory nature of the relationship became apparent immediately with the first two Army pilots trained by the Wright brothers: Lts. Frank P. Lahm and Frederic E. Humphreys.
