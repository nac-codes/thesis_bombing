ty assignments.  The unsatisfactory nature of the relationship became apparent immediately with the first two Army pilots trained by the Wright brothers: Lts. Frank P. Lahm and Frederic E. Humphreys.  Both officers conducted flight training with Wilbur Wright in October and November 1909.  As soon as Humphreys completed his training, the Corps of Engineers demanded his return to former duties at the Washington Barracks.  Meanwhile, Lieutenant Lahm faced a similar problem.  Army regulations required all line officers serving exchange tours to return to their primary branches after four years of detachment.  This caused Lahm, a highly experienced airship and now airplane pilot, to return to the cavalry shortly after training with the Wrights.22  More important, it left the Signal Corps with no trained pilots for its only aircraft, resulting in the aforementioned orders to Foulois to take the aircraft and $150 to Texas and learn how to fly.  By the end of 1911, Fouloisâ€™s work in Texas was starting to pay dividends.  The combination of his aerial feats and a growing public fascination with aviation spurred change to the three basic problems military aviation initially faced: funding, technology, and organization.  The period from 1912 to 1916 saw military aviation in the United States propagate at an exponential rate, both in numbers and in capabilities.  With this growth came the promise of great things to come, but it also foreshadowed problems that would have to be solved before aircraft could prove their worth as an instrument of war.    Meanwhile, a greater appreciation for the promise of aviation meant more money in the larger military budget battles.  On 3 March 1912, the annual War Department appropriation bill included its first ever allocation for aviation, totaling $125,000, of                                                 22 Chandler and Lahm, How Our Army Grew Wings, 182-83.
