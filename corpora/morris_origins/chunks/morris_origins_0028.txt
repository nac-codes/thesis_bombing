ng $125,000, of                                                 22 Chandler and Lahm, How Our Army Grew Wings, 182-83.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 30 --- 24 which $25,000 was made available immediately for the purchase of two new aircraft.23  This new money spurred technological and operational change.   On the technology side, the new funding created both strategic and tactical advances.  First, the Signal Corps bought two new aircraft from different builders.  These included a new Wright Type B flyer and one Curtiss airplane.  This multi-aircraft purchase introduced the first cross-pollination of aircraft design into the Army.  Next, the Signal Corps began to experiment with onboard technological advances that paved the way for future aviation capabilities.  Foulois described some of these advances in his depiction of 1914 as a year of experimentation.  He explained how pilots in the newly formed 1st Aero Squadron married aircraft with wireless telegraphs, cameras, machine guns, and early bombs.24  In this way, increased funding produced technological advances as the young pilots had more training time in the air, which provided them more incentive to think about new ways to utilize the new weapon.      Improved funding also aided organizational changes.  New money equated to new aircraft, which required more pilots to operate them.  This growth necessitated a system to manage the training of pilots, the acquisition of aircraft, and the supply of required equipment.  The first step in this process was to create a staff function in the Signal Corps to oversee the growth of Army aviation.  Originally started in 1907 as a three-person staff element to manage airship and airplane acquisitions, by 1912 the Aeronautical Division of the Signal Corps grew to include the financial management of the $125,000 budget for aeronautics.  This created the first piece of the organizational puzzle, a staff function to manage resources and requirements.
