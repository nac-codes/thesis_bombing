e the financial management of the $125,000 budget for aeronautics.  This created the first piece of the organizational puzzle, a staff function to manage resources and requirements.                                                 23 Ibid., 187. 24 Foulois, From the Wright Brothers, 116.

The Signal Corps met the requirement with the formation of a flight training school at College Park, Maryland.  Recruitment proved fairly easy, as the War Department had by this time collected a number of applications from eager officers desiring flight duty.  What was missing was a scheme for formally training pilots.  Hence, the school’s new commander, Capt. Charles deForest Chandler, set out to create a training syllabus to ensure novice pilots learned the prerequisite skills.  The end result was a program that required pilots to pass the Federation Aeronautique Internationale certification before granting them their military wings.25  This requisite created the bedrock of pilot training as the school moved first to Augusta, Georgia, and then to North Island for better flying weather.  As the flying school settled into daily operations, it also became a haven for new ideas and experimentation.  As early as the fall 1911, the school began to participate in technology experiments.  One of the most interesting of these was Riley E. Scott’s testing of a new bombsight in October 1911.  The school mounted Scott’s sixty-four pound telescopic device on one of its Wright B aircraft and conducted multiple drops of two eighteen-pound bombs to test the apparatus’s accuracy.26  While the equipment proved that bombing accuracy needed much more work, it also demonstrated how the new service was already thinking in terms of operational requirements.  This trend continued with further trials of airborne cameras, wireless sets, and machine guns throug
