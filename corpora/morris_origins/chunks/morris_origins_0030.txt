t also demonstrated how the new service was already thinking in terms of operational requirements.  This trend continued with further trials of airborne cameras, wireless sets, and machine guns throughout 1914.  Aviation also showed its potential value during operational maneuvers.  A detachment from the flying school made an impression on senior leaders during the                                                 25 Chandler and Lahm, How Our Army Grew Wings, 195-99. 26 Ibid., 206.

Foulois’s own words best describe the effect of the mission: “We proved that airplanes could replace the cavalry and could prevent surprise mass attacks by providing information on enemy troop buildups and movements much faster than ever before.”27  While Foulois’s own recollections of the event may not have been the accepted Army position on aviation, the participation in maneuvers like these opened the eyes of many senior leaders to the possibilities of aircraft as a military tool.    By 1914, both Congress and the Signal Corps realized military aeronautics needed restructuring.  On 18 July, Congress passed House Resolution 5304, “An Act to Increase the Efficiency of the Aviation Section of the Army.”  This legislation created a formal staff element within the Signal Corps to manage all Army aeronautics.  More important, the law created permanent funding and personnel accounts for this new staff function to manage.28  For the first time in its history, the Army now had a dedicated Aviation Section inside the Signal Corps with its own manpower and budget allocations.  The legislation also spurred change within the Army.  With a permanent budget in place, the Signal Corps determined it was time for an operational aviation unit dedicated to preparing for military operations.  Therefore, on 5 August 1914, Signal Co
