rmy.  With a permanent budget in place, the Signal Corps determined it was time for an operational aviation unit dedicated to preparing for military operations.  Therefore, on 5 August 1914, Signal Corps General Order #10 created the 1st Aero Squadron with Foulois as its commander.29    When combined, these two accomplishments represented a great leap forward for military aviation.  They went a long way toward solving the early problems of funding,                                                 27 Foulois, From the Wright Brothers, 101. 28 House Resolution 5304: Act to Increase the Efficiency of the Aviation Section of the Army, 18 July 1914 (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1914). 29 Signal Corps General Order #10, 5 August 1914, Record Group 18.2, National Archives.

The Aviation Section’s guaranteed budget line meant that it could now plan for the future with some semblance of stability.  While it could be argued that the funding was still insufficient, at least aeronautics was no longer funded out of Signal Corps surplus funds.  Similarly, the creation of a staff function, training school, and operational element went a long way towards preparing military aviation for combat.  Although it was still a small organization compared to that of European nations, the U.S. Army’s air service contained all the required elements needed for combat.  Finally, the combination of funding and organization helped create a system for properly testing and acquiring new airframes and equipment for the fledgling service.  Even with these dramatic changes, all was not sunshine and flowers.  Contained within the law itself were the kernels of new problems that the 1st Aero Squadron would face in Mexico and during the buildup of the AEF Air Service in World War I.  The first of these issues was personnel policies.  From the beginning, aviation was seen as the realm of youth.  This played a large
