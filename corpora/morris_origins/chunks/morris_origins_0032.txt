xico and during the buildup of the AEF Air Service in World War I.  The first of these issues was personnel policies.  From the beginning, aviation was seen as the realm of youth.  This played a large part in the Army’s initial policy of only allowing junior officers to train as pilots while on temporary duty of no longer than four years.  House Resolution 5304 codified this policy into law when it decreed that only unmarried lieutenants under thirty years of age could serve in the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps.  Foulois himself describes the unintended consequence of this policy; “the result was that the section was being filled with young, inexperienced second lieutenants, leaving no one with age and experience to command an aviation organization.”30     When extrapolated across the air service, the personnel policy created a two-fold problem.  First, operational commands at the training school and the 1st Aero Squadron were held by junior officers who lacked the experience an equivalent commander in the                                                 30 Foulois, From the Wright Brothers, 119.

This may explain some of the issues faced by the 1st Aero Squadron as their commander, Foulois, lacked a general staff tour that would have built planning and coordination skills before he went to Mexico.  Second, the policy helped create an attitude towards nonaviators commanding aeronautical organizations.  In an interesting historical quirk, Foulois complained in 1916 about the replacement of the experienced Col. Samuel Reber with the inexperienced Maj. William “Billy” Mitchell.  In what may seem like a foreshadowing of Mitchell’s own later objections, Foulois argued that while Mitchell was an experienced staff officer, his inexperience in solving the practical problems related to flying made him a poor choice to lead the Aviation Section of the S
