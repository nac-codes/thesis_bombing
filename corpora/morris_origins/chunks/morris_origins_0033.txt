, Foulois argued that while Mitchell was an experienced staff officer, his inexperience in solving the practical problems related to flying made him a poor choice to lead the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps.31  This closely relates to the second issue facing the air service after 1914: aviation culture.  As the personnel policies created a separate world for the young pilots, they soon saw themselves as different from the traditional Army officer.  Theirs was a world of daredevil feats and danger.  House Resolution 5304 reinforced this attitude when it awarded pilots a 50 percent increase in pay while on flying duty.32  These changes helped create a separate military identity in the young pilots, which often hindered their ability to coordinate properly with fellow officers in the combat arms branches.  This was not completely negative, though.  The sense of individuality bred a willingness to innovate that served the air arm well in the coming years.  When faced with troubling situations that the young pilots were not fully prepared for, they more often than not found innovative new technology or strategy solutions to overcome those problems.                                                   31 Ibid., 125. 32 House Resolution 5304.

The aforementioned junior rank of many aviators and the distinct aviation culture combined with a general lack of understanding by ground commanders to create a misperception of aviation’s capabilities and roles.  This often meant that aviation faced operational difficulties due to the lack of close cooperation with ground commanders.  Some of this can be seen in the immediate run up to the Mexican Expedition.  Gorrell’s own writing describes a shortage of flight training in Texas because the 1st Aero Squadron was building its own living quarters, operational buildings, and maintenance structures.33  I
