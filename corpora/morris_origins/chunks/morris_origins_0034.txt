ion.  Gorrell’s own writing describes a shortage of flight training in Texas because the 1st Aero Squadron was building its own living quarters, operational buildings, and maintenance structures.33  Inter-staff coordination could have alleviated the problem, but the combination of separate command chains, different cultures, and split operations limited cooperation.  The trend continued into operations as many field commanders lacked an understanding of how to use aircraft properly, while the junior aviators did not have a structural method to advise those commanders on proper aeronautical roles and missions. In this way, the early air service overcame the worst of its funding, technology, and organizational issues.  Nevertheless, in doing so, it encountered new problems.  Thus, the decisions made by early aviation pioneers, Army leadership, and politicians shaped the foundations of military aviation.  These were both physical as in aircraft technology, but also mental as in the start of a separate aviation culture.  While these foundations often created problems for the early aviators, they also created an openness to new ideas that served the air service well in the Mexican Expedition.                                                         33 Gorrell, “Riding Boots,” 22.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 36 --- 30 The Wake Up Call  Flight training, administrative duties, and social obligations filled Gorrell’s military aviation career before Mexico.  This busy schedule left the young pilot little time to concentrate on policy or doctrinal issues.  Even when Gorrell’s unit prepared to deploy to Mexico, he was so busy with supply duties, convoy commander missions, and training that he had little time to think of anything else.  That all began to change as the 1st Aero Squadron started flying combat missions in March 1916.  Gorrell and the other squadron pilots became dissatisfied with their aircraft and the missions they were given.  While this experience may
