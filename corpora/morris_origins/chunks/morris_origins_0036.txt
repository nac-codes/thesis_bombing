here.  As darkness fell, Gorrell lost sight of the other aviators in his formation.  He attempted to navigate alone, but became hopelessly lost over the darkened desert.  When he realized his predicament, he turned back north with the intention of returning to Columbus, but his JN-3 had reached its limits.  When the engine started to overheat, he made a forced landing inside enemy-controlled territory.  Knowing his extremely dangerous situation, Gorrell gathered a pistol and a few supplies before heading into the desert.  He spent the rest of the night in the wilderness until near dawn he happened upon a Mexican national.  Gorrell used his weapon and eight dollars in silver coins to persuade the reluctant man to return him to American forces.  After an arduous trip, Gorrell finally made it back to the squadron on 23 March 1916, bedraggled and the worse for wear.35   The deployment fiasco was not the only issue that drew attention.  Instead, it represented the first of a series of events that demonstrated the unpreparedness of military aviation.  Problems with technology, planning, and doctrine came to the surface as Foulois’s pilots increased the number and difficulty of their missions.  As before, the independent and resourceful aviators often developed work-around fixes, but in the end,                                                 34 Miller, Preliminary to War, 20. 35 Ibid., 27-28.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 38 --- 32 significant complications were visible not only to the Army, but also to the public and political leadership.    Almost from the beginning, technology was a problem for the 1st Aero Squadron.  While the Curtiss JN-3 proved adequate for training, its low power and poor service ceiling showed its true limitations during operations in Mexico.  When patrols moved to the Sierra Madre Mountains, the squadron’s pilots discovered their aircraft could not climb high enough to overfly the 10,000-foot ridgelines.  To make matters worse, the JN-3
