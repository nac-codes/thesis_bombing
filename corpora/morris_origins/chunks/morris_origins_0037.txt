When patrols moved to the Sierra Madre Mountains, the squadron’s pilots discovered their aircraft could not climb high enough to overfly the 10,000-foot ridgelines.  To make matters worse, the JN-3 proved difficult to control in the high winds and snow.  On 22 March 1916, Foulois even sent a memorandum to the Chief of the Aeronautical Division in Washington informing him of the incapability of the present aircraft to meet mission requirements.  By this time, he had already lost two of his eight aircraft in crashes.  Therefore, Foulois requested ten new aircraft--two each from the Martin, Curtiss, Sturtevant, Thomas, and Sloane companies.36  Unfortunately, the Signal Corps lacked a system rapidly to buy and deploy airplanes and Foulois had to sustain operations as best he could.  The squadron continued to lose aircraft to accidents through the end of March and into April.  By 20 April 1916, the squadron was down to just two functioning JN-3s.  Therefore, on 22 April Pershing sent the 1st Aero Squadron back to Columbus to refit and receive new equipment.  Waiting for them was the first of twelve new JN-4 aircraft, part of the Army’s 1916 purchase of ninety-four JN-4s for the air service.  During flight-testing, the men of the 1st Aero Squadron disliked the JN-4 so much that Foulois complained directly to Maj. Gen. Frederick Funston, the commander of the Army’s Southern Department.  Through Funston’s intercession with Secretary of War Newton Baker, the Army withdrew the JN-4s and replaced them with the 160-horsepower Curtiss                                                 36 Foulois, “Report of the Operations,” 2.

Even then, teething problems with the propeller required additional delays as the 1st Aero Squadron mechanics developed a new method to build propellers capable of operatin
