arriving until 1 May 1916.  Even then, teething problems with the propeller required additional delays as the 1st Aero Squadron mechanics developed a new method to build propellers capable of operating in dry desert climates.37  These delays effectively ended the squadron’s operational role in the expedition.  The 1st Aero Squadron’s problems went beyond aircraft.  A poor doctrinal understanding of how to use aviation also hampered the squadron’s success.  Initially, Pershing saw two roles for his aviation squadron: reconnaissance and communications.  Not only could the aircraft search for Villa’s forces, but they could also find independently operating U.S. columns and deliver orders from the commander.  This seemed like a reasonable approach not only to Pershing, but also to Foulois, who voiced support for the plan.  Yet, as the squadron’s JN-3 aircraft demonstrated difficulty with reconnaissance missions in the Sierra Madres, they were increasingly relegated to courier duty.  During the heart of the expedition from 26 March and 4 April, the squadron flew seventy-nine missions carrying mail and dispatches along Pershing’s line of advance, but only two reconnaissance missions.38  The unbalanced nature of operations drew the ire of many of the pilots.  Not only were they risking their lives flying incapable JN-3 aircraft, but also the vast majority of their missions were delivering mail.  Foulois even addressed the issue in his summary report of 28 August 1916.  One of his five recommendations was to confine flight duties                                                 37 Miller, Preliminary to War, 32. 38 Ibid., 29.
