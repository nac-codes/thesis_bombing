arried out by other service elements.39   These complaints might not have created a call for change outside of the few pilots in the 1st Aero Squadron except for the work of newspaper reporters attached to the expedition.  On 3 April 1916, an article in Joseph Pulitzer’s New York World claimed several pilots complained to reporters about airplane deficiencies and poor Signal Corps oversight of aviation.40  Almost immediately, a backlash occurred in the Army leadership.  Who were these young, brash pilots questioning Army and Signal Corps leadership, especially in the open press?  The Army launched an investigation into the matter and sent officers to interview the men of the 1st Aero Squadron.  Most pilots denied talking to reporters, but Gorrell admitted he discussed “foreign aviators, the lack of engine power in the aeroplanes of the First, and military aeroplanes, past and present” with the reporter Webb Miller.41  Interestingly, this admission did not hurt Gorrell’s standing or career.  Despite the initial anger at the newspaper article, most Army leadership and especially General Pershing recognized the value of aerial observation and were aware of the technical and logistics problems the infant branch faced.  In this environment, Gorrell’s points became a rallying cry for more investment in the air service and not a hindrance to his career.   Despite the best efforts of the 1st Aero Squadron, General Pershing could not locate and capture Pancho Villa.  Still the squadron’s pilots accomplished much in this early test of air power.  They flew 540 missions, greatly aiding in intelligence gathering                                                 39 Foulois,” Report of the Operations.” 9-10. 40 “Aviators in Mexico Tell World,” New York World, 3 April 1916. 41 Miller, Preliminary to War, 34-35.
