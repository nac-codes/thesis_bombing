MIT had a long history in aeronautical research that both the Army and Navy supported with funding and students.  Six years before the Wright brothers’ pioneering flight, MIT built its first wind tunnel as part of a student thesis.  Still, it was not until 1909 that the program truly started to expand.  In that year, a U.S. Naval Academy graduate, Jerome C. Hunsaker, enrolled at MIT.  Hunsaker applied his passion for aviation to his studies in engineering.  By the summer of 1913, he had helped create the core of an aeronautics program at MIT.  This program blossomed into a government-funded endeavor when Hunsaker and Donald Douglas built a permanent research wind tunnel in 1914, the first structure on the new MIT Cambridge campus.44  Gorrell entered this new program in September 1916 and once again proved a stellar performer.  Detached from military operations, Gorrell focused his attention on the science behind flying.  His graduate thesis, “Aerofoils and Aerofoil Structural Combination,” became a noted pioneering work in the field, receiving accolades from military, industrial, and academic sources.45  By June 1917, only two months after the United States entered World War I, Gorrell had graduated with a Master of Science degree and returned to the Army as a captain with an assignment to the Chief Signal Officer’s staff.46  His job on the staff was planning the operational structure and technology required for the Air Service in World War I.  Members of the staff remember Gorrell spending his days working out personnel, aircraft, and budget requirements on                                                 44 Lauren Clark and Eric Feron, “A Century of Aerospace Education at MIT” (paper presented a
