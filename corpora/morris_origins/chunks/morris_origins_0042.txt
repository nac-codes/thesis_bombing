Gorrell also benefitted from the second aspect of the Signal Corps response to Mexico: doctrine development.  In the aftermath of the Mexican Punitive Expedition, the Signal Corps realized it needed to focus attention on the proper use of aircraft in military operations.  Luckily, they had the perfect place to learn about aerial combat in the war in Europe.  From the outbreak of hostilities, the American Army received reports on the growing importance of aviation in the war effort.  The Signal Corps’ 1915 annual report included information on the air war and demonstrated how it influenced operational thinking.  The report described airplanes as proving their value in reconnaissance and artillery fire control.  It then went on to describe the growing importance of a new type of aircraft, the combat machine in both a pursuit and bombing role.48  Yet, at this early stage in the war, the American conclusions were less about technology and planning than funding.  The annual report’s recommendations focused on the additional budget requirements the Signal Corps would need should the Americans enter the war and not on the types of aircraft and missions it would fly.     After the experience in Mexico, this attitude started to change.  While budget numbers were still the primary concern, there
