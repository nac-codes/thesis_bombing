er the war and not on the types of aircraft and missions it would fly.     After the experience in Mexico, this attitude started to change.  While budget numbers were still the primary concern, there was a greater appreciation for planning and operational lessons.  Therefore, the Signal Corps decided to send observers to Europe to garner as much as possible from the British, French, and Italian air services.  The most famous of these observers was Col. Billy Mitchell, who left for Europe on 17 March with orders to investigate the status of French aviation.  When he arrived in Europe, Mitchell                                                 47 Edgar S.

Mitchell’s most dramatic experience occurred when he visited the headquarters of Royal Flying Corps (RFC) commander, Maj. Gen. Hugh Trenchard.  Mitchell arrived during one of the many mini-crises that often beset combat command headquarters.  When Trenchard’s aide tried to reschedule the visit, Mitchell complained.  Instead, as Trenchard came out of his office to see what the noise was about, Mitchell informed him that he would “like to see your equipment, your stores, and the way you arrange your system of supply.

The results led Mitchell to prepare a memorandum for the
