Trenchard found Mitchell’s impudence charming and coordinated a three-day demonstration of the RFC’s training, supply, and flying operations.  The results led Mitchell to prepare a memorandum for the soon to arrive Gen. John Pershing describing his concept for the organization and use of an AEF air service.  While Mitchell was developing his vision, Gorrell participated in another study group with the task of learning from European examples, determining proper technology, and securing the initial support agreements from the allied nations.  This group, led by Col. Raynal Bolling included Gorrell and was important for the development of American strategic bombing theory.  As Bolling and Gorrell visited with their British, French, and Italian counterparts, they developed an appreciation of the air power theories propagated within each nation.  This turned the summer of 1917 into an important era of                                                 49 Rebecca Grant, “The Real Billy Mitchell,” Air Force Magazine 84 (2001): 67.

In this way, Gorrell became the model for the new breed of aviator the air service needed as it entered World War I.  He had grown into not just a steady pilot, but also a proven academic, gifted planner, and talented logistician.  The process had not occurred overnight, but rather it was a gradual shift from the adventure-seeking young cadet to the open-minded military expert ready to make his mark.  Key moments along the way shaped Gorrell and prepared him for the great challenges that lay ahead.  West Point taught him discipline, but also kept his sense of adventure alive.  Aviation focused that pioneering sense towards a new military field with great possibilities.  His experiences in Mexico tempered his adventurism and taught him skills in the more mundane, but equally important areas
