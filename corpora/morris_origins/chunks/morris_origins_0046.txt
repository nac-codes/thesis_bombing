ircraft to build first.  With observation and pursuit aircraft to protect them the highest priority, bomber production remained low until 1918.  This foundational issue dramatically limited the efforts of strategic bombing advocates.         On the organization side, the era saw the formation of an aviation staff and command structure capable of growing with the expanding air service in World War I.  More important, the experience in Mexico convinced the Signal Corps to grow its own internal expertise to manage the structure.  Therefore, when the United States entered World War I, a core of experienced and educated pilots was ready to expand the fledgling service in terms of size, capabilities, and strategy.  Edgar Gorrell was a perfect example of this newly minted scholar aviator.  Given a baptism of fire in Mexico, shaped by MIT, and finally polished on the General Staff, Gorrell represented an ideal officer to learn from the Europeans and help craft an American vision of aerial warfare.    Finally, the doctrinal work in the era represents a small, but important early step in the formation of American military aviation thought.  Mexico forced the service to  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 47 --- 41 recognize that a proper operational usage concept was the core building block of aircraft design, organizational structure, and operational integration.  No longer blinded by the need to fight for funding, the young aviators turned for inspiration to the great air war being fought over Europe.  Just as the air war itself was evolving at a lightning pace, so too did the appreciation of strategy in the newly minted AEF Air Service.  As the first officers arrived on the continent, they experienced a learning curve akin to drinking from a fire hose.  Yet, in a handful of key American theorists this overwhelming situation produced new strategic insights.  In this way, the early aviation era and the Mexican Punitive Expedition in particular were critical events in the
