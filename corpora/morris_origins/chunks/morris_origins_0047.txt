key American theorists this overwhelming situation produced new strategic insights.  In this way, the early aviation era and the Mexican Punitive Expedition in particular were critical events in the development of strategic bombing theory.  The era is best summed up as a long slow period of initial learning, followed by a wake up call to the poor state of American military aviation, before a brief, but important period of sharp growth.  This air service development did not evolve from a planned strategy.  Instead, it resulted from the combination of internal and external decisions that shaped the very nature of aviation, the Signal Corps, and the air service.  In doing so, the decisions often had lasting, if not always planned, effects as the American flyers entered World War I.

In Europe, the all-consuming national rivalries acted as a catalyst to spur aeronautical funding and thinking.  The United States, seemingly safe behind its twin oceans, took a much slower and less costly approach.  This relative safety did not exist for Britain, Germany, and France, who all saw a direct threat only a few short hours flight away.  Hence, these nations were willing to fund aeronautics at rates American aviators could only dream of.  Still, European aviation revolved around the same three issues as it did in America: technology, organization, and doctrine.  Whereas funding problems focused American development towards technology at the expense of doctrine, in Europe, national tensions brought doctrine into its rightful place.  Both government and military leaders understood that conflict was likely and from the start envisioned aircraft playing a role.  This image differed depending on nationality, but overall the early acceptance of avia
