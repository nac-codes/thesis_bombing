and military leaders understood that conflict was likely and from the start envisioned aircraft playing a role.  This image differed depending on nationality, but overall the early acceptance of aviation as a military tool instilled new thinking that differentiated European aviation development and policy from that of the United States.  Yet, technology and organization did not always match the visions of aviation enthusiasts.  While ahead of their American counterparts, European nations suffered from similar technological and organizational problems.  At the start of the war, most had adequate airplanes and organizations to support the observation mission, but lacked long-  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 49 --- 43 range bombers or agile pursuit aircraft.   The vortex of combat rapidly changed the situation.  By 1916, technology and organization started to catch up to the concepts of air power advocates.  By 1917, all three elements--technology, organization, and doctrine--were largely in place.  All that was needed was the political commitment to expand military aviation beyond supporting ground and naval forces.  Into this dramatic period the first American aviators arrived in the late spring of 1917, eager and ready to learn.  Strategic Bombing: The Concept The notion of strategic bombing originated long before the outbreak of World War I.  Visions of destruction by aerial bombardment were popular in Europe since the first balloon flights in the late eighteenth century.  As the historian L.T.C. Rolt indicated, while the most obvious use for military balloons was observation, many strategists envisioned airships flying over enemy cities and dropping bombs on the populace below.50  Still, it was not until the turn of the twentieth century that strategic bombing caught the public’s attention, largely through the work of popular novelists.   Authors like Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, and R. P. Hearne excelled at playing on the fears of the time.  Verne’s 1893 nov
