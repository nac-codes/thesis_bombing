caught the public’s attention, largely through the work of popular novelists.   Authors like Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, and R. P. Hearne excelled at playing on the fears of the time.  Verne’s 1893 novel Clipper and the Clouds depicted a mysterious aviator named Robur using a zeppelin-like airship to influence national leaders.  While Verne’s work left room for interpretation, H. G. Wells’s 1908 The War in the Air was more direct.  Wells depicted a massive German aerial flotilla destroying New York in a surprise bombing attack.  Despite Verne’s and Wells’s fame, perhaps the most influential of the three was R. P. Hearne’s 1909 Aerial Warfare.

Hearne’s warning soon became widely accepted in the public and government ministries.  Historian John Morrow even credits Hearne with turning a general fascination with bombing into a full-fledged airship scare that lasted into World War I.51   While the futuristic literature may have generated an abundant readership and instilled a general fear in the public, the reality was that current aviation technology could never hope to match the visions of the early authors.  Even Hearne’s clarion call of warning lacked substantive evidence of German capabilities to deliver on his perceived threat.  In the end, though, it did not matter as fear overcame rational thought.  Public anxiety drove measures that both excited and frightened military professionals.  The German ballooning authority, H. W. L. Moedebeck, best described this disconnect in an 1886 paper on the value of bombing, stating that, “while the physical effects of bombing were almost nil, it undoubtedly produces a depressing effect to have things dropped on
