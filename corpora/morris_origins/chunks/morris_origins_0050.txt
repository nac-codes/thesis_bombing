ed this disconnect in an 1886 paper on the value of bombing, stating that, “while the physical effects of bombing were almost nil, it undoubtedly produces a depressing effect to have things dropped on one from above.”52  In this simple statement, Moedebeck captured the dichotomy of early strategic bombing.  The current technology promised little in terms of physical destruction, yet the psychological fear of bombing was a primal force causing national and popular responses.  This trepidation eventually worked its way into the thoughts of government leaders.  Initially, they attempted to control the threat through international agreements.  In the Hague Conference of 1899, the nations of Europe agreed to prohibit the discharge of any projectiles from balloons or similar devices for five years.53  Yet, international                                                 51 John H.

As heavier-than-air flight became a reality, European nations began to see value of airplanes in their arsenals.    By the time the prohibition on bombing came up for renewal at the Hague Conference of 1907, too much had changed.  The majority of nations refused to renew the articles based on three rationales.  First, the newly invented airplane showed too much promise as a military weapon.  While no country had plans for a bomber force at this early stage, neither did any of them want to forego the potential advantages airplanes might deliver in the future.  Next, most nations expected to use aircraft, both lighter and heavier than air, as observation platforms.  Surely, the enemy would defend against this threat with antiaircraft fire.
