most nations expected to use aircraft, both lighter and heavier than air, as observation platforms.  Surely, the enemy would defend against this threat with antiaircraft fire.  If pilots were fired upon from the ground, should they not be able to fire back?  Finally, all agreed that limitations already in place on assaulting undefended cities applied to aircraft as well as artillery.  Hence, there was no need to limit aircraft specifically.54  The catalyst for this international change of opinion proved to be the tremendous advances in aviation technology.  While Lord Northcliffe may have observed that “England was no longer an island” after Alberto Santos-Dumont’s groundbreaking flight on 20 October 1906 in Paris, the twelve-hour zeppelin flight on 1 July 1908 truly brought home the possibilities of long-range aviation.55  This flight produced a combination of fear and excitement throughout Europe.  Many politicians and civilians saw a new terror that threatened their peaceful lives miles behind potential front lines.  Meanwhile, military professionals saw a means to target distant industrial and political centers.                                                   54 Neville Jones, The Origins of Strategic Bombing: A Study of the Development of British Air Strategic Thought and Practice up to 1918 (London: William Kimber, 1973), 25-26. 55 Morrow, Great War in the Air, 4.

In Germany, long-range aviation offered a means to target directly the previously untouchable British homeland.  This tied in with increasing German nationalism, which saw zeppelins as a symbol of German power.  The Germans even carried this attitude over to their international negotiations.  At the May 1910 International Conference on Aerial Navigation in Paris, they proposed that “the navigation of the air above a foreign country should be free in principle, and t
