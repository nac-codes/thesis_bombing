national negotiations.  At the May 1910 International Conference on Aerial Navigation in Paris, they proposed that “the navigation of the air above a foreign country should be free in principle, and that foreign airships should not be treated less favorably than those of nationals.”56  While the other European nations immediately rejected the proposal, it helped define Germany’s attitude toward aviation in the run up to World War I.  Aeronautics represented a critical strategic threat that Germany could use to show its strength.  Sometimes though, attitudes carry unintended consequences.  In 1911, Germany faced a critical choice between developing airplanes or airships.  Even at that early date, aeronautical advances suggested that airplanes might offer a cheaper and more flexible capability than costly zeppelins in the not too distant future.  Yet, the zeppelin was a critical component of the German national identity.  Therefore, on 25 October 1911, the Prussian War Minister Josias von Heeringen convinced Kaiser Wilhelm that Germany must preserve airship superiority over the other European nations.57  This decision effectively limited aircraft development through the diversion of exorbitant funds to the production of zeppelins.  At the same time, German strategic thought gravitated towards zeppelin raids as the primary strategic attack method.  In the end, this cultural decision                                                 56 S. W.

The French public mirrored the German enthusiasm for aviation.  Airships and airplanes became both a fascination and a cause for fear.  The French historian, Edmond Petit, sums up this period nicely as aviat
