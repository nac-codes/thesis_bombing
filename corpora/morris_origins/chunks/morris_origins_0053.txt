nch public mirrored the German enthusiasm for aviation.  Airships and airplanes became both a fascination and a cause for fear.  The French historian, Edmond Petit, sums up this period nicely as aviation became a “universal preoccupation” in France.58  As with Britain, the exuberance made its way into government policy.  The French War Ministry used its relatively larger aviation budgets to set the standard for air power development.  The Army became an active part of the aviation industry by directly funding many aircraft designers.  Besides the expected technological advances, the investment program created valuable connections between French military leaders and the aviation industry that helped foster an understanding of air power absent in most other nations.  The most notable example was the future French military commander, Joseph J. C. Joffre, who chaired a commission on aviation experiments in 1905.59  This interaction with aviation introduced Joffre to the potential for air power and likely made him more open to innovative uses for aircraft.     Nonetheless, French aviation enthusiasts, like their American counterparts, often met resistance when dealing with senior military leaders.  Ferdinand Foch, the future allied Commander-in-Chief, stated in March 1913 that “Aviation is a fine sport.  I even wish officers would practice the sport, as it accustoms them to risk.  But, as an instrument of war, it is worthless.”60  Foch’s attitude demonstrated the suspicion of aviation that many senior leaders held in the early twentieth century.  Yet, Foch’s own words highlight                                                 58 Edmond Petit, La Vie quotidienne dans l’aviation in France au debut du XXe siècle, 1900-1935 (Paris: Hachette, 1977), 79. 59 Morrow, Great War in the Air, 11. 60 Louis Morgat, “L’aviation en Berry avant la Grande Guerre,” Revue Historique des Armees 1 (1980): 199.
