In France, aviation was perfectly in line with the offensive spirit and esprit de corps the French military wanted instilled in all officers.  In America, on the other hand, early aviators were often considered eccentric daredevils and outside the normal behavior for an army officer.  This more accepting attitude in France helped create perhaps the best prepared air service in August 1914 with 141 combat planes organized into twenty-one squadrons and another 176 in reserve or training roles.61   Where the Germans and French represented straightforward approaches to military aviation, the British took a more complex path.  In October 1908, Britain’s Committee on Imperial Defense set up a subcommittee headed by Reginald Baloil Brett, the 2nd Viscount of Esher, to investigate the dangers aerial navigation posed to Britain and what advantages Britain might gain by developing its own airships and airplanes.  Lord Esher’s own report speaks best for the guiding principles behind early British aviation development.  He wrote, “the evidence before the Committee tends to show that the full potentialities of the air-ship, and the dangers to which we might be exposed by their use, can only be ascertained definitely by building them ourselves.  This was the original reason for constructing submarines, and in their case the policy has since been completely vindicated.”62  Lord Esher’s report formed the basis for one avenue of British aeronautics growth.  A strong desire to match the German zeppelin program pushed Britain towards developing its own airships and strategic air power.  In a reflection of naval policy, this aerial arms race offered security through parity as a means of                                                 61 Morrow, Great War
