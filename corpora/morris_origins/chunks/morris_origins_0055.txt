hips and strategic air power.  In a reflection of naval policy, this aerial arms race offered security through parity as a means of                                                 61 Morrow, Great War in the Air, 35. 62 Report of the Esher Committee, 28 January 1909, AIR 1/2100, 207/28/1, The National Archives of the U.K.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 55 --- 49 deterrence.  As might be expected, the Royal Navy favored this vision for aviation as it coalesced with traditional naval strategies of attacking an enemy’s means and will to resist through blockades and direct attacks.  Yet, airships were only one aspect of British aviation.  A second focus evolved around the growing importance of heavier-than-air flying machines.  On 17 February 1912, the Committee on Imperial Defense Sub Committee on Aerial Navigation recommended the formation of an airplane equipped flying corps to support army operations.  The subcommittee even prioritized the missions for the new flying corps in this order: reconnaissance; reconnaissance protection; communications; artillery spotting; and bombardment.63   This dual nature of air power in England both shaped and was shaped by the divide between the Army and Navy.  The Army’s steadfast concentration on ground support drove technology, organization, and doctrinal thinking in its air service, the Royal Flying Corps (RFC).  Technological development moved toward slow, but highly stable aircraft well suited for observation missions.  Organization centered on squadrons directly tied to Army commands, with little latitude for independent operations.  Finally, doctrine mirrored the thinking of ground officers who saw aviation as a tool to augment the cavalry in reconnaissance or support the artillery in correcting fires.   These early changes set the tone for future RFC air operations.  They ingrained not only a way of thinking, but more important, they created foundations that proved difficult and costly to correct.  A good example is
