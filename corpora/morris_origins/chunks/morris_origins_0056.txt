es set the tone for future RFC air operations.  They ingrained not only a way of thinking, but more important, they created foundations that proved difficult and costly to correct.  A good example is the first widely produced RFC aircraft, the Royal Aircraft Factory Be2a.  While the                                                 63 Jones, Strategic Bombing, 38.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 56 --- 50 Be2a’s inherent stability aided the reconnaissance mission, its top speed of 70 miles per hour and bomb load of only one hundred pounds limited its use as a pursuit or bomber aircraft.64  Moreover, designing a new airplane took time.  Hence, the RFC had to manage with poorly suited designs for a large portion of the early war. On the other hand, the Royal Navy viewed air power in a strategic light.  Naval thought centered on using airplanes to help maintain sea control through attacks on enemy ships, ports, and support facilities.  This vision of air power led to different technologies, organizations, and doctrinal concepts.  From the start, the Navy pursued aircraft designed for long overwater flights and bombing.  By 1913, the Royal Navy led the world with the first published manual of air navigation, the first purely designed aircraft compass, and a circular slide rule for calculating wind drift.  At the same time, navigation in the RFC meant little more than map reading.65  Similarly, the Navy differed from the Army in organization.  Naval aviation favored the independent wing concept, which offered more latitude for aerial operations.  Finally, the First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill’s policy of the offensive-defensive guided doctrinal thought.  In the policy, Churchill advocated for attacks on the zeppelin bases as the best means to prevent their use against England.  At first, his policy channeled doctrine towards eliminating the zeppelin threat by destroying their bases and support facilities.   As the war progressed, though, it was only a sm
