As the war progressed, though, it was only a small jump to apply Churchill’s and the Navy’s construct to strategic attack against German industry.                                                 64 Robin Cross, The Bombers:  The Illustrated Story of Offensive Strategy and Tactics in the Twentieth Century (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1987), 8. 65 Jones, Strategic Bombing, 43.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 57 --- 51 The consequence of the dichotomy was that Britain started World War I with in effect two air forces.  The Army brought fifty airplanes with the British Expeditionary Forces (BEF) for direct ground support.  Meanwhile, the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) had ninety-three long-range airplanes and six airships at their disposal when the war began.66  Two other nations merit consideration in the run up to World War I.  Foresighted aircraft designers in both Italy and Russia helped steer technology towards long-range aviation.  Italy was perhaps the more important of the two.  The Italian aircraft designer Giovanni Caproni led the way with his three-engine 260-horsepower Ca-1.  This aircraft, which first flew in late 1914, carried a crew of four and up to 460 pounds of bombs with a range of 344 miles.67  Caproni’s aircraft fit nicely with Italy’s strategic problem.  If the Italians joined the war, they almost certainly faced the need for a long and costly offensive through the Alps against Austria-Hungary.   Long-range aircraft seemed to offer the potential to avert this grueling land campaign.  As Caproni advised, his bombers could overfly the Alps to strike at important Austro-Hungarian military targets.  At the very least this would act as super long-range artillery to support the ground offensive.  Yet, in some Italian aviators’ minds, particularly Giulio Douhet, a new more exciting poss
