ry targets.  At the very least this would act as super long-range artillery to support the ground offensive.  Yet, in some Italian aviators’ minds, particularly Giulio Douhet, a new more exciting possibility started to coalesce.  If built in sufficient numbers, long-range bombers could attack Austro-Hungarian war industries directly, potentially even forcing them to cease hostilities for a lack of armaments.                                                  66 Morrow, Great War in the Air, 45-46. 67 Michael Sharpe, Biplanes, Triplanes, and Seaplanes (London: Friedman/Fairfax Books, 2000), 43.

Under Sikorsky’s direction the Russians built the Ilya Moromets Type A, which had its maiden flight on 11 December 1913.  Originally designed for commercial passenger transport, its 113-foot wingspan, four engines, and a fully enclosed cabin held immense military potential especially in long-range bombing and reconnaissance roles.68  This melded ideally with the Russian strategic situation.  With long distances separating them from German industrial and logistics facilities, the Russians required such an aircraft to have any hope of attacking German strategic targets.  Unfortunately, the size and complexity of the Ilya Moromets limited Russian production with only twenty examples available for operations in 1916.  Still, the bomber succeeded in flying more than four hundred missions against mainly the German Army from February 1915 until Russia’s departure from the war.69   The Ilya Moromets seems to represent a technological advance that other European nations could have used.  Unfortunately, the remoteness of Russia tended to shield their technology and doctrine from aviation strategists in the west.  While Sikorsky did eventually license production of his aircraft to the British and French, by 1916 the cost of the bomber and the allied nations’
