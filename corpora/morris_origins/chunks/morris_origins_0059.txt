and doctrine from aviation strategists in the west.  While Sikorsky did eventually license production of his aircraft to the British and French, by 1916 the cost of the bomber and the allied nations’ own bomber developments precluded building large numbers of them.70                                                     68 Cross, The Bombers, 7. 69 Sergei I.

The immense military exertion from the Schlieffen plan for the Germans and Plan XVII for the French and British limited strategic air operations.  During this period of full effort, all military and air power was concentrated on defeating the enemy’s ground forces.  This reality differed greatly from the novelist visions of bomber fleets roaming free to attack European cities.  Instead, most bombers were drawn to operational targets such as railyards and supply depots in an effort to aid ground forces.  It did not mean that the fear of bombing evaporated, though.  A great concern still existed in the public and governments of the warring states.  This fear was even evident in the German declaration of war on France.  As part of the rationale for war, the Germans cited the French bombing of Nuremburg on 2 August 1914.71  This was interesting considering that the Germans knew that no aircraft in the French arsenal could fly as far as Nuremburg.  Many historians explain this occurrence as a combination of fear and rumors influencing the German government.  Another possibility is that the Germans understood the psychological fear of bombing and used the reports to galvanize their population.  Either way, instead of the predicted aerial bombardments of national capitals, the early bombing efforts took the form of small independent
