ombing and used the reports to galvanize their population.  Either way, instead of the predicted aerial bombardments of national capitals, the early bombing efforts took the form of small independent raids.  On 6 August, the Germans launched their first zeppelin attack on Liege, Belgium, with minimum results.  Perhaps more foretelling was the 30 August 1914 raid by a small German Taube airplane on Paris.  Lt. Ferdinand von Hiddessen broke                                                 71 Kennett, History of Strategic Bombing, 19.

These raids did not cause the public panic many prewar visionaries predicted.  Despite eleven deaths, most Parisians considered the raids a spectacle and jockeyed for positions to watch the aircraft drop their bombs.  The reality of these early raids was that they were not part of any organized effort.  For their part, the Germans likely saw them as a diversion to keep pilot morale high during dangerous reconnaissance missions.  Meanwhile, the French and British were too involved in the Battle of the Marne to think much about single aircraft raids.  All sides were too engrossed in the all-consuming early battles on the western front to consider strategic bombing.  This situation in France began to change after the Battle of the Marne.  Once the German race to the sea was halted and trench lines established, aviation units had more freedom to return to prewar doctrines.  The first such effort was by the British RNAS.  While the First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill had long been concerned over the Zeppelin threat, this new stage of the war provide the opening he needed to launch the first RNAS long-range
