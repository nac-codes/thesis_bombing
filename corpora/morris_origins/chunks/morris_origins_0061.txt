.  While the First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill had long been concerned over the Zeppelin threat, this new stage of the war provide the opening he needed to launch the first RNAS long-range aerial attacks against their bases.  With the bulk of the RFC in France, the British government gave the Navy the task of defending English airspace.  Using his vision of the best defense is a good offense, Churchill proposed controlling the air for 100 miles around the                                                 72 Cross, The Bombers, 10.

Even when the Navy could deviate from Army requirements, greater priorities meant naval aircraft targeted submarine pens and port facilities.  It was not until the end of September that the RNAS turned its bombers towards the zeppelins.  The service conducted four raids between 22 September and 25 December 1914.  The raids on 22 September, 8 October, and 25 December were traditional counterforce missions aimed at destroying zeppelin sheds and the airships inside them.  The raid on 21 November targeting the zeppelin factory at Friedrichshafen was more important for strategic bombing.  It required the RNAS to move secretly four new single-engine Avro 504s to Belfort on the Swiss border.  These aircraft then flew low over Lake Constance, attacked the airship works, damaged a zeppelin under construction, and created a tremendous explosion at the factory’s hydrogen gasworks.74  Despite the heroic nature of the raid, its true importance lies in the target selection.  For the first time, air power attacked an industrial source of an opponent’s military power.    This must have seemed like a foreign concept to the RNA
