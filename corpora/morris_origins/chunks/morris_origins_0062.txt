s true importance lies in the target selection.  For the first time, air power attacked an industrial source of an opponent’s military power.    This must have seemed like a foreign concept to the RNAS’s sister service the RFC.  Unlike the RNAS, the RFC’s prewar focus on ground support meant the RFC in France had limited long-range assets and capabilities.  The Army’s decision to take the most experienced officers to France only exacerbated the                                                 73 Morrow, Great War in the Air, 80. 74 Cross, The Bombers, 12-13.

The decision meant mainly inexperienced men filled the critical staff functions needed to grow the RFC.75  The task of buying aircraft and training thousands of new pilots rapidly overwhelmed these green staff officers.  In the melee of staff work, they all too often ignored issues of technology development, aerial strategy, or even garnering lessons from the front.  Accordingly, British historian Neville Jones describes this early era as critical for strategic bombing.  On one hand, the RNAS laid a foundation capable of growing to meet the needs of strategic bombing in the later stages of the war.  On the other, the RFC failed to set a solid foundation for future operations.  Failure to collect lessons from the front meant delays in technology, organization, and doctrine change, which created long-term problems for the RFC.   The First Strategic Bombing Campaigns, 1915  While the story of strategic bombing in 1914 revolved around the British RNAS, 1915 saw the French and then the Germans take the lead.  Their air forces introduced new technologies, organizational schemes, and planning methodologies into strategic bombing.  In doing so, they added to the foundation laid in the prewar era and tested by the RNAS.      In late 1914, the new French Director of Aeronautics Col. Edouard Bares envisioned a specially designed air unit focused on strategic attac
