undation laid in the prewar era and tested by the RNAS.      In late 1914, the new French Director of Aeronautics Col. Edouard Bares envisioned a specially designed air unit focused on strategic attack.  The result was Groupe de Bombardment no.1 (GB 1) consisting of eighteen single pusher engine Voisin bombers divided into three escadrilles placed under the direct                                                 75 Jones, Strategic Bombing, 51.

Joffre’s background on the 1905 aviation commission opened him to new air power ideas and he supported Bares’s concept to use the group to strike German communications and industry.  With the full support and protection of Joffre, GB 1 flew its first mission against the railway station at Freiburg on 4 December 1914. While this was an important first for French strategic bombing, Bares must have understood that for bombing to succeed it needed a well-thought-out targeting strategy.  This is evidenced by the new strategic campaign plan for 1915 he built in December and January.  The heart of his plan was a target selection model based on weighing a target’s importance against its vulnerability to French raids.77  This refinement proved the most lasting part of Bares’s plan as it counterbalanced the need to strike critical industries with the reality of limited aerial resources.  Perhaps more important, it afforded a means to modify priorities as new technologies made their way to the battlefield.  Joffre approved the plan in late January and even went one step further and earmarked twenty-one out of the planned seventy-one new escadrilles for 1915 as bomber units.  Thus, GB 2 came into existence in January and GB 3 in March.78  This expanded force conducted raids on primarily chemical and iron works in Karlsruhe, Trier, and Saarbruc
