Thus, GB 2 came into existence in January and GB 3 in March.78  This expanded force conducted raids on primarily chemical and iron works in Karlsruhe, Trier, and Saarbrucken throughout 1915.  Initially, the French met with a modicum of success, but their Voisin bombers proved difficult to                                                 76 Cross, The Bombers, 15. 77 Ibid., 16. 78 Ibid., 16.

Moreover, as the Germans learned the art of aerial defense, French aircraft losses mounted.  By late 1915, the French turned to night bombing and limited their efforts.   Historian John Morrow best sums up the early French strategic bombing campaign: “Aware that the war was becoming a conflict of material, GQC selected industrial targets for a strategic bombing campaign intended to shorten the war.  Unfortunately, their simple and robust Voisin aircraft, modified artillery shell bombs, and primitive techniques proved unsuitable.”79  Still, the French campaign added to the foundation of strategic bombing that future advocates built upon.  This is especially true for Bares’s targeting scheme, which survived into future British and American strategic campaign plans. The French were not the only nation to set their sights on strategic bombing.  By late 1914, the German military turned its attention to prewar thoughts of zeppelins terrorizing French and British cities.  Initially, the Kaiser resisted these efforts.  He feared killing a member of the British royal family or destroying an important historical site.80  The French campaign against German cities that started in December helped change his mind.  After a particularly strong raid against Freiburg, the Kaiser finally relented.  On 15 January 1915, he gave permission to target the British coastal ports, but in this escalating cycle of violence, London could not re
