On 15 January 1915, he gave permission to target the British coastal ports, but in this escalating cycle of violence, London could not remain unscathed for long.  Finally, in an Imperial Order of 12 February, the Kaiser designated the London docks as a valid military                                                 79 Morrow, Great War in the Air, 93. 80 Douglas H.

The year 1916 started even better for the Germans.  On 31 January, nine zeppelins converged over Liverpool.  While the bombing produced little in physical destruction, it had two important psychological affects.  In Germany, it enabled the leader of the Naval Airship Division Capt. Peter Strasser to convince the Kaiser that his zeppelins could overpower Britain if he could only solve problems with navigation and bombing.  Hence, at a critical moment, Germany continued to split its limited resources between airships and airplanes.  On the other side of the North Sea, the zeppelin raids caused widespread panic among many night-shift workers who refused to come to work for up to a week.82  The threat to war production focused the British government and military on the morale effects of bombing.  Perhaps, this early German campaign even ingrained a particular significance for the morale aspect of strategic bombing in t
