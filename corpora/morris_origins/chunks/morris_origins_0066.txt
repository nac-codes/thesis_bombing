used the British government and military on the morale effects of bombing.  Perhaps, this early German campaign even ingrained a particular significance for the morale aspect of strategic bombing in the British psyche. Finally, 1915 saw a small, but important foray by the Italians.  When Italy joined the war on 23 May, it was the only nation with an airplane specifically designed for long-range bombing, the three-engine Caproni Ca-1.83  Yet, the                                                 81 Ibid., 95. 82 Cross, The Bombers, 24. 83 Despite the Ilya Mouromets preceding the Ca-1, the IM was originally designed as a passenger plane and later converted to a long-range bomber.

For most of their first year in the war, the big Capronis flew ground support and reconnaissance missions.  This slowly started to change in the late summer of 1915, mainly through the efforts of Giulio Douhet.   Born near Naples in 1869, Douhet entered the Italian Army as an artillery officer in 1888.  Throughout his career, Douhet maintained a precarious position.  On one hand, he demonstrated a keen intellect advocating the benefits of increased mechanization.  On the other, his constant public critiques of military planning and funding created tensions with his superiors.  The result was a mixed record of prestigious commands and menial staff jobs.84   Perhaps these mixed results led to Douhetâ€™s fascination with aviation in 1908.  While still attached to the artillery, he wrote a series of articles advocating air power as a powerful military tool.  When Italy formed its first aviation element in 1910, Douhet used his connections to secure a transfer to the newly formed Aviation Battalion in late 1912.85  While in the battalion, he continued to learn about air power and wrote articles advocating for more funding.  By 1914, Douhet had succeeded to command the battalion, w
