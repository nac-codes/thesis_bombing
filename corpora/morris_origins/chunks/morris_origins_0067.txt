tion Battalion in late 1912.85  While in the battalion, he continued to learn about air power and wrote articles advocating for more funding.  By 1914, Douhet had succeeded to command the battalion, where he took a great interest in strategic bombing.  He worked feverishly on a plan calling for large multicrew Caproni bombers to operate independently against industrial targets.  Unfortunately for Douhet, his personality got in the way of his dreams.  After he overreached his authority by authorizing the purchase of Caproni bombers, the                                                 84 Frank J.

Before departing from the Aviation Battalion, Douhet wrote a series of articles in Gazzetta del Popolo advocating for a strategic bombing campaign to destroy Austria-Hungary’s industrial capability and will to resist.86  While these ideas did not capture the attention of the Italian military in 1915, they did work their way into the growing cross-pollination of Allied ideas on strategic bombing.  Douhet addressed some of the key problems early French and British bombing efforts faced.  Both nations realized small single or two-seat bomber crews became overwhelmed with navigation, bomb aiming, and defense during long missions, leading to poor results.  Douhet suggested a dedicated large multicrew bomber like the Caproni could solve this problem. In this way, 1915 proved a critical first step in strategic bombing.  The French took their first tentative steps towards strategic bombing, while the Germans attempted their own campaign with their zeppelin fleet.  The results of both campaigns were minor, but the doctrinal changes were long lasting.  The Bares targeting strategy became a foundational element present i
