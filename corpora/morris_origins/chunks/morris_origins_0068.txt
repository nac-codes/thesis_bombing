ir own campaign with their zeppelin fleet.  The results of both campaigns were minor, but the doctrinal changes were long lasting.  The Bares targeting strategy became a foundational element present in all future French, British, and American strategic campaigns.  Meanwhile, the Germans learned from their early efforts and set in place a system to prepare their air services for a new and larger effort against England.  Even the British, who did not conduct a strategic campaign in 1915, learned from the German raids.  Their experience with panics in the wake of zeppelin raids raised the importance of morale effects in their future strategic bombing plans.  Finally, the Italians                                                 86 Morrow, Great War in the Air, 129.

Next, the major battles of Verdun and the Somme once again required a full commitment of military resources, leaving little available for strategic bombing.  Hence, 1916 was mostly a retreat for strategic bombing advocates.  Still, there were some success stories such as the British RNASâ€™s 3 Wing, which shaped bombing technology, organization, and doctrine.  The year started with a difficult situation for the French.  On 21 February 1916, the Germans launched their effort to bleed the French army white at Verdun.  As part of the offensive, the German air service conducted a massive aerial assault designed to seize the initiative in the skies.  The French knew they had to act swiftly.  On 29 February, the French aviation comman
