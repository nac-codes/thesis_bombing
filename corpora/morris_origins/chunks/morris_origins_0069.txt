ffensive, the German air service conducted a massive aerial assault designed to seize the initiative in the skies.  The French knew they had to act swiftly.  On 29 February, the French aviation commander Bares decided to concentrate the French air forces at Verdun to win back the air.  This included the formation of fifteen elite fighter squadrons.87    Verdun became a killing ground for French pilots just as it was for the common Poilu.  This caused an increasing draw on French resources and its aviation industry.  By June 1916, the French amassed 1,120 aircraft in the Verdun                                                 87 Ibid., 132-33.

In the daily battles over the trenches, the French lost pilots and airplanes at almost unsustainable rates.  To meet this need, the French modified their production priorities.  Whereas 1915 saw observation and bomber aircraft as the greatest priority, in the spring of 1916 the French changed to observation and pursuit.  This does not mean strategic bombing stopped completely.  GB 1 and GB 2 continued raids on German economic targets in early 1916, striking the railroad station at Metz, ironworks in Lorraine, and munitions factories in the Saar region.  Yet, as Verdun consumed more resources and then the Somme offensive started, the French strategic bomber units found themselves increasingly pulled out for tactical support.  The final straw occurred on 12 October 1916.  On that day, the French conducted a joint raid with the RNAS against the Mauser factory at Oberndorf.  Losses from the mission were high, with seven of twenty-four aircraft lost.89  With factories unable to make up the losses in bombers due to increased pursuit production, the French turned to night bombing for the remainder of the year, despite its poor accuracy.  One major lesson for the French in 1916 was the need for a dedicated strategic
