reased pursuit production, the French turned to night bombing for the remainder of the year, despite its poor accuracy.  One major lesson for the French in 1916 was the need for a dedicated strategic bomber.  Their two-seat Voisin bombers lacked the range and sturdiness to penetrate enemy defenses and bomb strategic targets.  Meanwhile, the Caproni bombers built under license from Italy proved too underpowered for sustained combat operations.90  In this way, a failure to advance strategic bombing technology combined with a decrease in priority to push French strategic bombing                                                 88 Ibid., 135. 89 Cross, The Bombers, 34. 90 Morrow, Great War in the Air, 138.

While there were still advocates of strategic bombing in France, the trials of 1916 focused French politicians and military leaders on the dire need to win air superiority over the front for successful ground operations.  In this environment, strategic bombing suffered from a paucity of resources and a low priority.  Meanwhile across the Channel, the early bombing efforts of the RNAS seemed to increase the prospects for a British strategic bombing campaign.  New long-range aircraft like the Sopwith 1 ½ Strutter and more accurate bombsights offered greater capabilities.  Additionally, growing cooperation with the French offered the prospect for a joint strategic campaign.  Finally, the stand up of a purely strategic bombing wing with British Expeditionary Force Commander Gen. Douglas Haig’s expressed blessing seemed to indicate that political will might finally exist for a large bombing effort.    Unfortunately for British bombing advocates, the war also intervened to hinder their plans.  Just as with the French at Verdun, the Somme became an all-consuming vortex, which captured the full might of the British military.  In this all-
