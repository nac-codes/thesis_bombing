in-C sees no need to object in any way to long distance bombing being undertaken by the Royal Naval Air Service, with the proviso that any such bombing undertaken in the area behind the German lines in front of the British Army shall be subject to his concurrence.”92  Despite General Haig’s official acceptance of 3 Wing, the RNAS effort faced opposition from both internal and external sources.  The external opposition came from the expected source, the RFC.  Leading the opposition was Sir David Henderson, the former commander of the RFC.  He saw 3 Wing as a direct threat competing for valuable aviation resources.  In his current position as Director-                                                91 Cross, The Bombers, 33. 92 Policy Statement on Air Bombing, GHQ, 3 June 1916, AIR 1/978, 204/5/1139, NAUK.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 72 --- 66 General of Military Aeronautics in the war office, Henderson viewed 3 Wing as a grave threat to his resources.  Consequently, he used his connections to the Joint War Air Committee (JWAC) to challenge the RNAS plans.   The JWAC was a government committee designed to limit overlap and waste in the often-competing army and naval air forces.  Henderson seized on the concept of overlap when he sent a memorandum to the JWAC on 4 February 1916, stressing that the competition for long-range engines was hurting the RFC’s ability to produce observation aircraft needed for the Somme offensive.93  He followed up this complaint with two other objections that summer arguing that long-range bombing operations from land was an RFC mission and a duplication of effort.  The internal opposition to 3 Wing came from an unexpected source.  The commander of the Dover Patrol, Adm. R. H. Bacon, also voiced opposition to the plan.  He wrote on 1 June 1916, “warfare in the air, to be useful, has to be entirely subservient to warfare on land or sea”94 Because Admiral Bacon controlled all naval activities at Dunkirk, 3 Wing could only expect lim
