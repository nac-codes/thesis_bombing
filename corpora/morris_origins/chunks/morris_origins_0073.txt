June 1916, “warfare in the air, to be useful, has to be entirely subservient to warfare on land or sea”94 Because Admiral Bacon controlled all naval activities at Dunkirk, 3 Wing could only expect limited support from the primary British naval base in France.  Bacon’s disapproval could not have occurred at a worse time.  The start of the Somme offensive on 1 July created a logistical and organizational nightmare for 3 Wing.  Still in the process of standing up the wing, Captain Elder found himself without a strong supporting command just when he needed it most.  Instead, he had to contend with three major problems and no easy solutions.                                                 93 Jones, Strategic Bombing, 85. 94 “Memorandum in response to Captain C. L. Lambe’s Assessment on Air Warfare,” Admiral R. H. Bacon, 1 June 1916. AIR 1/633, 17/122/90, NAUK.

The Sopwith 1 ½ Strutter proved itself not only a good long-range bomber, but also a good observation and tactical bombing aircraft.  Hence, the Army began to take an ever-increasing number of the new deliveries to France.  This combined with the French agreement to create a critical aircraft shortage in 3 Wing and delayed their operations status until October. The second problem was the lack of a campaign plan.  As the RNAS did not have a strategic bombing command structure, there was no higher staff to develop targeting priorities, coordinate operations, or evaluate mission results.  Therefore, the Admiralty agreed to place 3 Wing under the guidance of the French, who had developed a staff support structure to command the operations of their bombardment groups.96   This was not necessarily a bad de
