iralty agreed to place 3 Wing under the guidance of the French, who had developed a staff support structure to command the operations of their bombardment groups.96   This was not necessarily a bad decision.  The French had more experience than the British in commanding and controlling larger bomber units.  In addition, their bombing campaign plan of September 1916 was ahead of its time.  It called for targeting industrial categories based on their importance to the German war effort.  In this way, French planners could weigh the relative importance of iron, chemical, or munitions industries without the added confusion of trying to rank order individual factories.  Finally, the French planners continued Baresâ€™s system of weighing the importance of individual targets versus the risk of attacking them.                                                  95 Jones, Strategic Bombing, 104. 96 Ibid., 107.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 74 --- 68 In the end, the French system allowed them and the British to make rational choices on which sites to attack that would hurt the German economy the most, while reducing the risk to their own severely underequipped bombing forces. The final problem for the RNAS was the loss of governmental support.  Despite initial inferiority in numbers, the Germans quickly reinforced their aerial forces in the Somme region.  By late 1916, casualties over the Somme became critical with the British recording the loss of 782 aircraft from July to November; almost twice the number they started the campaign with.97  With the RFC constantly arguing for greater priority in aircraft production, the British government disbanded the JWAC in October and created the new Air Board under Lord George Nathaniel Curzon. The government tasked this new committee with determining the priority of aircraft production, the best strategy for military aviation, and the structure it should use.98 The Air Board set about its work immediately.  Unfortunately, with the
