ith determining the priority of aircraft production, the best strategy for military aviation, and the structure it should use.98 The Air Board set about its work immediately.  Unfortunately, with the prohibitive attrition rates it was difficult for any government organization to limit assets to the RFC.  After receiving a memorandum from General Haig describing the immense need for aircraft replacements for the RFC, the board ruled against the Admiralty and gave production priority to the Army.  The board even went one step further; it recommended that the Navy lend both aircraft and pilots to the RFC during this time of crisis.  Not wanting to appear adversarial, the Admiralty ordered 3 Wing to provide nineteen pilots and six aircraft to augment the RFC.99                                                  97 Morrow, Great War in the Air, 173. 98 Jones, Strategic Bombing, 90. 99 Morrow, Great War in the Air, 175-76.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 75 --- 69 This double whammy not only slowed the arrival of new aircraft at 3 Wing, but also removed critical assets already in place. Still, 3 Wing’s story is not one of failure.  Despite the delays and setbacks the wing achieved operational successes.  By the time they flew their last mission on 14 April 1917, the wing’s pilots had conducted eighteen raids, including four night missions with the new four-engine Handley Page 0/100 bombers.100  While these numbers were low compared to the fifty-two tactical raids conducted from Dunkirk in the same period, 3 Wing had many more logistical, distance, and command issues to overcome than other units.   A better methodology for measuring the wing’s success is to examine its contribution to the advancement of strategic bombing technology, organization, and doctrine.  In technology, 3 Wing operations reinforced the need for dedicated multicrew bombers.  The use of the Handley Page showcased the advantages offered by large multicrew aircraft for improved navigation, bombing a
