ogy, 3 Wing operations reinforced the need for dedicated multicrew bombers.  The use of the Handley Page showcased the advantages offered by large multicrew aircraft for improved navigation, bombing accuracy, and defensive capabilities.  Meanwhile, the wing’s use of the Sopwith 1 ½ Strutter demonstrated the overwhelming requirement for a two-seat daylight bomber, leading to the highly capable DH 4.  Organizationally, 3 Wing highlighted the need for an independent bomber force.  The operational delays caused by logistics and inter service fighting hampered the wing’s operations.  When government attention once again turned towards strategic bombing as a priority, the lessons from 3 Wing drove their thinking.  Finally, the wing’s work with the French ingrained their target selection and prioritization schemes into British doctrine.                                                  100 Cross, The Bombers, 36.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 76 --- 70 When the time came to develop a British bombing plan, French concepts provided guidance.   In this way, 1916 saw the tremendous cost of two massive ground offensives intervene to put strategic bombing on the back burner in all nations.  The French, caught off guard at Verdun, rapidly switched their priority to meet the German onslaught.  The British, on the other hand, meticulously prepared for the Somme, but a combination of Trenchard’s aggressive offensive plan and poor aircraft technology caused extremely high attrition rates.  In this light, British strategic bombing fell to an under-supported wing operating without strategic guidance.  Finally, the Germans were overwhelmed with the tactical air war and largely ignored strategic campaigns outside of a few raids.   Still, the year was not a total loss for strategic bombing.  The hard-won lessons the previous year remained intact and survived until the bombing’s renewal in 1917.  Additionally, the British learned important lessons through the limited operations of
