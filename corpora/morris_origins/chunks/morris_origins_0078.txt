for Strasser, a combination of Verdun, the Somme, and Jutland disrupted his plans and required the services of many of his zeppelins.   By the autumn of 1916, the situation started to change.  With the High Seas Fleet unable to break the British blockade and the German Army locked in a battle of attrition, the zeppelin seemed to offer a potential means for the Germans to break the stalemate.  Strasser seized on the moment when he wrote to Commander of the High Seas Fleet Adm. Reinhard Scheer on 10 August 1916 that, “the performance of the big airships has reinforced my conviction that England can be over come by means of airships.”102  With Scheer’s full approval, Strasser set out on one last big effort to break the British economy and will.                                                   101 Robinson, Zeppelin in Combat, 128-29. 102 Ibid., 165.

Better tracking, more capable interceptors, and new incendiary bullets drew a heavy toll on the attackers.  Of the 187 zeppelins launched against England that year, only 111 reached their targets.  Meanwhile, during the height of Strasser’s all-out offensive six costly zeppelins had been lost in combat.103   More important than the losses was the successful testing of the new Gotha bomber in the autumn of 1916.  These new twin-engine long-range bombers offered a means to strike England without the cost or dangers of vulnerable slow-flying zeppelins.  The German Army decided to invest its future in this new technology and officially cancelled its zeppelin program in January 1917. With this change in thinking, the commander of the German Air Service, General Ernst von Hoeppner proposed to create a thirty-aircraft bombing squadron of Gotha bombers for a strategic campaign against Britain.  The German high command, or OHL, saw value in the plan and ordered Capt.
