von Hoeppner proposed to create a thirty-aircraft bombing squadron of Gotha bombers for a strategic campaign against Britain.  The German high command, or OHL, saw value in the plan and ordered Capt. Ernst Brandenburg to establish Kagohl 3, the England Squadron, in February 1917 at St. Denis Westrum in Belgium.104   By May, the squadron was ready for operations.  On the twenty-fifth, the unit flew its first mission when twenty-one Gothas targeted London, but were forced to bomb Folkestone due to poor weather.  Despite its poor results, the initial raid anticipated a new aerial campaign against London, for which the                                                 103 Ibid., 203. 104 Cross, The Bombers, 41.

This weakness was soon brought home when fourteen Gothas dropped seventy-two bombs on London, killing 168 people.  What was perhaps more galling than the deaths from the 13 June raid was that despite launching ninety-two aircraft to intercept the bombers, the British recorded no aerial victories that day.105   Concern over the losses and seeming impotency of the air defenses led to a public outcry.  This demand for increased protection led to the recall of Generals Haig and Trenchard to testify to the cabinet on 20 June 1917.  In typical fashion, Trenchard advised that the best defense was to occupy Belgium to push the German bases back beyond the range of the Gotha bombers.106  Unmoved by his logic, the cabinet ordered Haig to release two pursuit squadrons from the continent to bolster homeland defenses.  Trenchard acquiesced, but when no new raids appeared by the end of June he started actions to return the squadrons to the front. Trenchardâ€™s move coincided with a new raid by the Germans, who sent twenty-one Gothas over London on 7 July, causing fifty-four deaths and mor
