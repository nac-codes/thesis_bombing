he started actions to return the squadrons to the front. Trenchard’s move coincided with a new raid by the Germans, who sent twenty-one Gothas over London on 7 July, causing fifty-four deaths and more than 200,000 pounds in damage.107  This new round of bombing turned the previous clamor into an uproar.  Fear gripped the public in ways that even the government focused on the front could not help but observe.  By the summer of 1917, up to 400,000 Londoners left the city or sought nightly air raid shelters.                                                  105 Harvey B.

Jan Smuts to investigate the status of aviation and aerial defenses.  The Smuts Commission released two important findings that summer.  First, on 19 July 1917, the commission called for a reformation of the aerial defense system.  This led to the creation of a single command system integrating observers, command and control, antiaircraft artillery and interceptor aircraft.109   While this was an important step, the Smuts Commission’s second report released on 17 August had greater implications.  The report is most famous for recommending the formation of an independent Royal Air Force by combining the resources of the RFC and the RNAS, but it also had a significant effect on strategic bombing.  Section seven of the report gave a strategic direction to the new RAF when it said: The magnitude and significance of the transformation now in progress are not easily realized.  It requires some imagination to realize that next summer, while our western front ma
