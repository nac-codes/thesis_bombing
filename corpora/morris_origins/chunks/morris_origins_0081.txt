It requires some imagination to realize that next summer, while our western front may still be moving forward at a snail’s pace in Belgium and France, the air battlefront will be far behind on the Rhine, and that its continuous and intense pressure against the chief industrial centers of the enemy as well as on his lines of communication may form the determining factor in bringing about peace.110                                                  108 Kennett, History of Strategic Bombing, 26. 109 Reprint of the Smuts report in, H.
