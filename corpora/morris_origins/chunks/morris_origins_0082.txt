officers called to support the RFC, Tiverton’s interest in bombing theory led to his selection to work with the French on strategy issues.111   In this role, he likely garnered a deep appreciation for Bares’s targeting methodology, which he modified to his own needs.  Bares’s influence is clearly seen in the paper Tiverton submitted to Vyvyan on 2 September 1917.  Tiverton recommended creating an independent bomber force based in the Verdun area targeting the critical industrial categories of iron and chemical works in Dusseldorf, Cologne, Mannheim, and the Saar region.112  Even considering the French influence, Tiverton produced a uniquely British vision of a strategic bombing campaign.  Most notably, he recommended a                                                 111 George K.

In this way, the first half of 1917 saw the rebirth of strategic bombing after the horrendous year of 1916.  With a war of attrition settling over the trench lines, all sides sought a new means to bring decision to war.  Strategic bombing advocates leapt at the chance to test their theories.  While political will did not exist in 1916, the disheartening outlook for the Germans and the reaction to Gotha raids provided a previously unavailable political will to both sides.  Even with this newfound incentive, there were still problems to overcome.  Logistical and production problems plagued everyone.  Additionally, the allies suffered from the question of how to integrate the soon-to-arrive American forces.  Still, the future looked promising for strategic bombing during that critical summer of 1917.  Conclusion   Into this maelstrom of aviation growth, new thinkin
