easily use their Caproni bombers to attack German industry from its more suitable bases in eastern France.  Hence, early American visitors often received a dual sales pitch for strategic bombing and the Caproni bomber.  In the end, it was left up to a select group of American aviators and strategists to sort through the complex mix of technology, political pressure, and operational lessons.  Luckily, the Americans had spent the year between the Mexican Punitive Campaign and their entry into the war preparing just such a group.  Men like Billy Mitchell, Raynal Bolling, and Edgar Gorrell soon found themselves at the center of a grand decision.  It became their role to select the best elements of each nation’s aerial strategy and merge them into a uniquely American doctrine.                                                        113 Kennett, History of Strategic Bombing, 29.

The technological, organizational, and doctrinal foundations set between 1903 to 1916 came home to roost with a vengeance as the United States entered the war.  Poor technological planning meant that the Air Service never had the numbers of aircraft they needed, especially lower-priority bomber aircraft.  Organizationally, inexperienced junior officers, hurriedly promoted to senior leadership positions, often found themselves with little or no guidance while making important decisions.  A lack of a solid doctrinal foundation compounded the issue, frequently splintering the air service’s plans.  Finally, a separate service culture made coordination between these newly promoted flyers and senior ground commanders a difficult process at best.  All these issues combined to create confusion, inefficiencies, and misdirection that affected the size, structure, and missions of the rapidly exp
