g faced an uphill battle to gain traction in the strategy and planning worlds.  Nevertheless, it had many supporters both within the American Army and among its new European allies.  Unfortunately, the lack of an agreed-upon bombing doctrine as America entered the war meant that many different visionaries advocated for their own opinions.  Aerial bombing thought diverged into two distinct areas: strategical and strategic bombing.  Historians often overlook this slight variance, but their different connotations contain one of the core strategy debates guiding American bombing theory development.  In the end, the resulting American concept for strategic bombing was not a choice between strategical or strategic, but represented an amalgamation of these internal and external ideas, influenced by the realities of war.                                                  114 Mason Patrick, The United States in the Air (Garden City, NJ: Doubleday, 1928), 7.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 86 --- 80 Starting from Scratch As the United States entered World War I, the debate swirled over what would be the role of American air power.  As no commonly held doctrine existed, the door was open to many personalities and influences.  Aerial bombing was often far from the minds of the political and military planners working to determine the size, technology, and mission of the soon to be formed AEF Air Service.  The idea of using large dedicated bombing aircraft to hinder an enemy’s ability to prosecute a war was not completely new to the close-knit community of Signal Corps aviators.  Still, it was going to be a long road to overcome the traditional Army vision of air power.   Aviation was always a secondary consideration for the U.S. Army.  Aircraft had a role to play, but that role was subordinate to the primary functions of the infantry, artillery, and cavalry.  The Army’s gospel on military operations, the Field Service Regulation of 1914, cemented aviation’s supporting role.
