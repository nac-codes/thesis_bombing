was subordinate to the primary functions of the infantry, artillery, and cavalry.  The Army’s gospel on military operations, the Field Service Regulation of 1914, cemented aviation’s supporting role.  While a full section of the manual discussed aviation, its missions were limited to reconnaissance, observation, and aerial artillery spotting.  The only direct combat role for aviation was a single sentence in section 31: “Aeroplanes are also used to prevent hostile aerial reconnaissance.”115   This should not be surprising, though.  In 1914, most European armies also thought aviation’s primary role would be in observation and artillery support.  Few theorists saw an independent combat mission for these often-fragile aircraft.  The key difference between Europe and America was the combat experience of World War I.  In Europe, necessity forced pilots, air services, and eventually the armies themselves to think differently about air power.  This was especially true in the critical summer of 1917 during the reaction to the German Gotha raids on London.

America’s path was different.  Isolated from the context of fighting in Europe, Army doctrine inculcated itself deep into military thinking.  This is evident in the Chief of the Signal Corps Brig. Gen. George P. Scriven’s testimony before the House Military Affairs Committee in December 1914.  As Scriven defended the aviation budget request, the Democratic Committee Chairman, James Hays of Virginia, asked him if aircraft had developed any practical value for offensive military purposes.  Scriven responded, “No, sir, I believe not.”  He then wen
