mocratic Committee Chairman, James Hays of Virginia, asked him if aircraft had developed any practical value for offensive military purposes.  Scriven responded, “No, sir, I believe not.”  He then went on to describe how recent tests in San Diego showed U.S. aircraft could carry only about 120 pounds of bombs and had difficulty hitting selected targets.  Scriven ended this portion of his testimony with a statement that doomed American bombing for the next two years: “nor do I wish to be understood as saying that in a few isolated cases bomb dropping may not do harm, but only that as a fighting machine the aeroplane has not justified its existence, except aeroplane against other aircraft.” 116  With this simple statement, Scriven effectively rank ordered U.S. air power missions as observation first, pursuit second, and bombing third.  As the conflict in Europe evolved, even the Americans could not ignore the rapidly developing air war.  In March 1915, the Army War College started a study on the proper size, constitution, and missions of the Army should it enter World War I.  The military aviation section of this report demonstrates that thinking on air power was slowly changing.  While the study still relegated bombing to a tertiary role, for the first                                                 116 Maurer Maurer, ed., U.S. Air Service in World War I (Washington, DC: Office of Air Force History, 1978), 29.

Section sixteen of the study called on America to adopt the European model where “a special type of aeroplane has been developed for dropping bombs, these machines are sent in flotillas of from 30 to 60 machines.  Against railways, roads, bridges, and hostile parks of various kinds, this method of attack has given considerable success.”117 This slow evolution of doctrine would have likely continued except for the entry of the United States into World War I in April 1
