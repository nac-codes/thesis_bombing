rious kinds, this method of attack has given considerable success.”117 This slow evolution of doctrine would have likely continued except for the entry of the United States into World War I in April 1917.  The rapid pace of military expansion quickly changed the dynamics of the doctrinal debate.  The initial problem for air power planners seemed to be where to start.  There simply was no accepted concept for the mission, size, or structure of the soon to be created AEF Air Service.  That changed on 24 May 1917 when President Woodrow Wilson received a telegram from French Premier Alexandre Ribot spelling out the French vision for American air power.  Premier Ribot’s cable is important enough that it deserves a full review. It is desired that in order to cooperate with French aeronautics the American government should adopt the following program: The formation of a Flying Corps of 4,500 aeroplanes to be sent to the French front during the campaign of 1918.   2,000 planes should be constructed each month as well as 4,000 engines by the American factories.  This is to say that during the first six months of 1918, 16,500 aeroplanes (of the latest type) and 30,000 engines will have to be built.  The French government is anxious to know if the American government accepts this proposition, which would allow the allies to win supremacy of the air.118  This request from the French soon became the guiding principle behind American air power planning.  On 3 April 1917, the Secretaries of the Navy, the War Department, and the Chairman of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics came together to create the Joint Army-Navy Technical Board.  This six-person committee was tasked to                                                 117 War College Division, Military Aviation Study (Washington, DC, 11 September 1915). 118 Cable from Premier Ribot to French Ambassador in Washington, 23 May 1917, BAP Hist. box 6, 311.2, National Archives.
