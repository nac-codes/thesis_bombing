There was one major flaw with using the French request though.  The Ribot’s cable, at least as delivered, did not address the doctrinal roles for the American air forces.  This is an interesting quirk of history as Ribot’s cable was based on a French General Staff study of the structure of American air forces required to win the war.  In an almost mirror image of accepted American policy, the French study prioritized aviation requirements as first aircraft to search for submarines, then pursuit and bombing aircraft for offensive operations, and only then observation and artillery spotting aircraft for direct ground support.120  Had the strategy portions of the French study been included in Ribot’s cable, perhaps American doctrinal thought would have developed differently.   Instead, as historian I. B. Holley suggests, Ribot likely relied more on a clarifying memorandum submitted by the Commander of the French Armies of the Northeast to build his cable.  In this memorandum, the commander recommended that the American offensive group in the General Staff study consist of thirty pursuit groups and thirty bomber groups, or about 4,320 aircraft.121  It is highly likely that Ribot simply borrowed this easily defined number to base his request for United States production.  Unfortunately, without the corresponding General Staff Study, the doctrinal guidance became lost in the transatlantic communication.                                                 119 I. B.
