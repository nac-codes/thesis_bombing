Lacking any direct guidance on production priorities, the board developed a 3:5:1 ratio of observation to pursuit to bomber aircraft.122  This decision had two major ramifications for the development of strategic bombing.  First, it formalized the long-held Army vision of air power dominated by observation and pursuit missions.  Next, by prioritizing bomber production at such a low ratio, the board ensured that any delays in aircraft construction would exponentially affect bomber deliveries to combat units.   Luckily there was one bright spot for the future of aerial bombing in the board’s process.  It introduced a newly minted Capt. Edgar S. Gorrell to doctrinal debates.  Freshly returned from his MIT masters program, Gorrell’s status as one of the few aeronautical engineers in the military made him the ideal choice for an Air Service member of the Joint Army-Navy Technical Board.  The board’s president and Gorrell’s old squadron commander, Benjamin Foulois, quickly secured his posting to one of the Air Service’s positions.  In this role Gorrell became an integral part of the stateside planning effort, while gaining an appreciation of the production numbers and their lack of doctrinal basis. In the end, t
