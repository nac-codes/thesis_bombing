ce’s positions.  In this role Gorrell became an integral part of the stateside planning effort, while gaining an appreciation of the production numbers and their lack of doctrinal basis. In the end, the Joint Army-Navy Technical Board’s recommendation was the best vision for American aviation expansion available at the time.  It soon became the core of the War Department’s aviation appropriation request for $640 million.  Considering this bill was the then largest single amount ever approved by Congress, the Army sweetened the deal with assurances that these 4,500 new aircraft would be at the front by May 1918.                                                  122 Report of the Joint Army-Navy Technical Aircraft Board, 29 May 1917, Sec A11, in Gorrell History, 11-12.

The Signal Corps rapidly saw the problem and took steps to fix it.  On 16 May 1917, the Council on National Defense authorized the creation of the Aircraft Production Board to advise and aid in the coordination between the Army and the civilian aircraft industry.  Its first chairman, Howard E. Coffin, soon saw to it that the board was moved under the Army with the mission of advising the Signal Corps on aviation technology.124  Coffin started his professional career in the automobile industry, gaining a reputation for standardizing material and production processes.  With this background, he quickly identified the need to produce only a few aircraft types if American industry was to have a reasonable chance of making the 4,500 aircraft production goal.     As the Aircraft Production Board and the Signal Corps leadership began to ponder which aircraft types to produc
