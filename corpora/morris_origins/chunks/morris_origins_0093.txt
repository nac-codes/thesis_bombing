dustry was to have a reasonable chance of making the 4,500 aircraft production goal.     As the Aircraft Production Board and the Signal Corps leadership began to ponder which aircraft types to produce, the need for aviation strategy to drive those choices became apparent.  Unfortunately, the guidance that existed from the Joint Army-Navy Technical Board and the old Army War College study were of limited value.  Therefore, key leaders often advocated their own visions for American air power.   One such example of this occurred in a joint interview on 6 June 1917 by the Sun Newspaper with Brigadier General Squier and Howard Coffin.  While Coffin limited his statements to the industrial might American could bring to the war, Squier discussed his vision of how American air power would help win the war.

Then, he included a small, but telling discussion on the potential role bombing could play in winning the war.  He indicated “the Allies so far have not been able to develop and use bombing machines to the needed extent because they could not secure enough airplanes to carry out this work on a great scale.”  This was not an insurmountable issue, though.  Squier went on to say “that once furnished with all necessary numbers of airmen and aircraft, we (America) can speed victory by carrying out bombing and observation work unhindered.”125  This newspaper article is evidence that the growing acceptance of bombing as an offensive tool was starting to inculcate into key aviation leaders inside the American Army.
