but they also needed to be technical experts in aeronautics and aircraft design.  Who could be a better choice than Gorrell as the combat-proven new graduate of the MIT Aeronautical Engineering program and member of the Joint Army-Navy Technical Board?  That he was then working on the estimate for the air service’s $640 million congressional funding request only sweetened the deal.  Gorrell’s combination of aeronautical engineering expertise, planning experience, and growing reputation as an intellectual secured him one of the two Army positions on the commission.  On 16 June 1917, Gorrell joined the other military members on the White Star passenger liner Adriatic as it departed from New York for Liverpool.127  The ten-day crossing proved useful as the members of the team socialized and shared their backgrounds and thoughts on aviation.  As historian I. B. Holley rightly points out, Bolling left New York before the Joint Army-Navy Technical Board finalized its recommendations.  Hence, he infers that Bolling had to rely on the Ribot cable and what he garnered from the board’s initial report for doctrinal guidance.128                                                   126 History of the Civilian Motor Mechanics Group, 18 December 1918, Sec A-2, in Gorrell History, 21. 127 George K.

As a member of the Joint Army-Navy Technical Board and of Benjamin Foulois’s team drafting the Air Service appropriations request, Gorrell offered a wealth of information for Bolling to draw upon.  Perhaps this explains the strong professional bond that developed between Gorrell and Bolling during the Atlantic crossing.  Members of the commission remember the two staying up late into the night discussing their flyin
