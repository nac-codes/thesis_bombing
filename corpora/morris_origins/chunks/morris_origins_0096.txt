the strong professional bond that developed between Gorrell and Bolling during the Atlantic crossing.  Members of the commission remember the two staying up late into the night discussing their flying experiences, aeronautics, and the proper use of aircraft.129  It is possible these late-night discussions turned Gorrell’s mind towards more than just the purchase of aircraft and to how best to use these aircraft in combat.  Despite the silence of Gorrell’s own records on the matter, it is reasonable to assume the discussions rekindled an interest in aerial strategy he had shown during the Mexican Expedition. Still, the commission had a task to accomplish and not much time to achieve it.  Once Bolling arrived in England his team split into two groups.  The civilian experts under the supervision of Rolling I. Mowry of the Cadillac Motor Company dispersed to aircraft factories around Europe to observe and determine how best to integrate American manufacturing into their processes.130  Meanwhile, the military members conducted a whirlwind tour of the major combatants to garner information on their aircraft designs, production capabilities, and ability to support U.S. aircraft needs.  Bolling’s own report on the trip gives a hint at the frantic pace the commission members kept during that early summer: “landed at Liverpool June 26, 1917, proceeded to London, remained there about a week, proceeded to France and to Paris, remained there about two weeks, proceeded                                                 129 “The Men and Machines: Air Operations in World War I, Part V,” Air Power Historian 5 (January 1958): 42. 130 History of the Civilian Motor Mechanics Group, Gorrell History, Sec A-2, 21.
