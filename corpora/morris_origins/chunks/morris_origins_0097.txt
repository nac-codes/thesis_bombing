about ten days, returned to Paris and remained there about ten days.”131   By late July the commission’s leadership was once again in their Paris headquarters at 45 Avenue Montaigne, near the Arc de Triomphe.  Here Bolling started work on his final report.  The report released on 15 August 1917 identified three required elements for American air power.  The first priority was to build a sufficient number of training aircraft to support the required numbers of new pilots.  The second priority was to build aircraft for direct support of ground forces.  Then in a new twist for American air power theory, Bolling recommended the creation of a force in excess of tactical requirements consisting of fighting and bombing airplanes for independent military operations against Germany.132 This offensive force cannot yet be associated with strategic bombing, though.  Strategic bombing was still too nebulous a concept in the AEF Air Service for such a linkage at this early point.  Bolling reinforced this position in a memorandum to Coffin on 15 October in which he indicated strategic bombing was still a widely debated concept throughout Europe in the summer of 1917.  He depicted the British government as becoming supportive of bombing as a tool for revenge, but balanced that against British Army resistance to anything beyond a ground support role.  Meanwhile, Bolling portrayed the French as hesitant due to concerns over German retaliation and a “temporal lack of interest.”  In the end, Bolling described only the Italians as fully supporting bombing, but painted them as overblown in their claims.  For instance, he quoted the commander of aerial operations with the Italian Fourth Army, General Magreatti, as                                                 131 Report by Maj. Raynal C.
