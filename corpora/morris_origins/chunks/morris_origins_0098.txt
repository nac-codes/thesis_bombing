File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 96 --- 90 telling him that “with systematic and sustained bombing…he could force a retreat of the Austrian Army within fifteen days.”133 Despite these problems, Bolling went on to predict that bombing success was possible if carried out in a systematic, thorough, and consistent manner.  Because this was a difficult task with the limited assets on hand, Bolling indicated that “the Allies must combine towards certain definite operations for which the preparation should be begun at once.”134  Bolling seemed to peer into the future when he predicted that the only obstacle to thwart strategic bombing success was if individual nations refused to participate in these combined operations, instead coveting their air power solely for their own purpose. While important, the Bolling Commission members were not the only Americans working out the details of American aerial strategy and policy in Europe.  Even before April 1917, American air power theory was changing rapidly because of increased coordination with the British, French, and Italians through a series of military observers.  For the Air Service, Lt. Col. William Mitchell was the most important observer.  On 17 March, the Chief of the Signal Corps ordered Mitchell to investigate the status of French and British military aviation.135   Upon arriving in Europe, Mitchell threw himself into the task of learning as much as possible about both nations’ aviation efforts.  In typical Mitchell fashion he did not let little things like regulations stop him from flying with the French over enemy lines or proper decorum stop him from visiting Maj. Gen. Sir Hugh Trenchard unannounced and                                                 133 Memorandum Bolling to Coffin, 15 October 1917, Bolling Collection, box 1, folder 9, Greenwich, CT Historical Society, 3. 134 I
