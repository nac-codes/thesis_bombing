Still, his short time in Europe made him the most experienced American aviator in theater.  He used this experience to ensure he was with the party welcoming General Pershing when he arrived in Paris on 13 June 1917.136  Mitchell did not wait long to get his ideas on aviation into the AEF commander’s hands.  He quickly submitted a paper on air policy and organization to Pershing’s Chief of Staff, Maj. Gen. James G. Harbord.   Mitchell’s memorandum is an interesting study in contradiction.  What at first appears to be a prioritization argument likely hides a deeper doctrinal subtext.  At first glance, the structure of the memorandum seems to push for more emphasis on strategic aviation, yet his definition is not consistent with the later understanding of strategic bombing.  His explanation of “the air attack of enemy material of all kinds behind his lines” hints at something broader than attacking an enemy’s industrial production capability or morale.  It is likely Mitchell was still forming his concept of strategic aviation as this terse definition is strikingly different from his short, but informative definition of tactical aviation: “to ensure observation for fire and control of our own artillery…airplanes and balloons observe the fire while others fight off hostile aircraft which attempt to stop it.” 137 Still, the memorandum provides insights into two important aspects of Mitchell’s thinking at this early stage that historians often misinterpret.  The first of these relates to independence.  At two points, Mitchell clearly suggested that air power ought to be an
