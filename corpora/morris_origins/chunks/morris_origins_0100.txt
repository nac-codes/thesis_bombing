cts of Mitchell’s thinking at this early stage that historians often misinterpret.  The first of these relates to independence.  At two points, Mitchell clearly suggested that air power ought to be an independent element in the Army combat structure.  First, he proposed that the entire AEF Air Service should be on an equal footing with other combat branches.  Mitchell                                                 136 Ibid., 48. 137 Memo, Mitchell for the Chief of Staff, U.S. Expeditionary Forces, 13 June 1917, contained in Gorrell History, Sec A-23, 81.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 98 --- 92 then specifically addressed strategical forces in section three when he wrote, “strategic aviation must be organized, separate from those directly attached to army units.”138  This was a clear break from the previous Signal Corps’ position that air power was purely supportive to ground combat operations.  Instead, Mitchell hinted at a separate, possibly independent, role for the AEF Air Service.   Next, the memorandum brings up an interesting conundrum related to the understanding of strategic aviation.  Was Mitchell truly advocating strategic bombing in the summer of 1917?  On one hand, he talked in general terms about using air power to attack the enemy’s war making material.  Some of his own wording can even be interpreted as supporting the modern understanding of strategic bombing.  For instance, his claim at the end of the memorandum that “with this class of aviation the United States may aid in the greatest way and which, it is believed if properly applied will have a greater influence on the ultimate decision of the war than any other one arm,” seemed to hint at a war-winning role for independent strategic bombing. 139  On the other hand though, Mitchell’s broad use of strategical aviation was more in line with the modern definition of aerial interdiction.  His statements like “they would be used to carry the war well into the enemy’s country” could be interpr
