se of strategical aviation was more in line with the modern definition of aerial interdiction.  His statements like “they would be used to carry the war well into the enemy’s country” could be interpreted to mean interdicting the flow of supplies and reinforcements well behind the front lines.  Additionally, this application of air power was more consistent with Mitchell’s appreciation of the British model he garnered during his meetings with the RFC Commander, Sir Hugh Trenchard.  By the summer of 1917, Trenchard viewed air power’s primary role as supporting Army offensive operations by constantly attacking                                                 138 Ibid., 82. 139 Ibid., 81.

Thus, it is most likely that Mitchell’s memorandum actually advocated a two-fold mission for air power.  On one level it described a tactical force conducting observation and artillery spotting missions in direct support of ground commander.  Meanwhile, on a different level Mitchell advocated for a semi-independent strategical element that would attack the enemy’s war materials behind the front lines.  It is quite likely that a misunderstanding of Mitchell’s use of strategical aviation in this memorandum explains many historians’ belief that Mitchell advocated the modern understanding of strategic bombing early in World War I.   Still, Mitchell’s radical proposal caused concern in the AEF staff.  Even if he was not advocating for strategic bombing as a war-winning tool, he seemed to support an independent role for the AEF Air Service that many senior ground commanders deemed threatening.  It is likely that Mitchell’s memorandum was fresh in the AEF Chief of Staff’s mind, when less than a week later, on 19 June, Major General Harbord convened a Board of Officers to make recommendati
