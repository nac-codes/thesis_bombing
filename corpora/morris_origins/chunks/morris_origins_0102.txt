g.  It is likely that Mitchell’s memorandum was fresh in the AEF Chief of Staff’s mind, when less than a week later, on 19 June, Major General Harbord convened a Board of Officers to make recommendations on aviation matters.  The board contained of a mix of aviators, combat arms members, and staff officers.  At their first meeting, the board assigned individual members to research specific aviation areas and make recommendations.  Maj. Frank Parker received the task of reviewing bombardment aviation. Although Parker was a cavalry officer, he had close ties to military aviation.  He had married the daughter of Lt. Col. Frank S. Lahm, the first Army officer to fly in a                                                 140 Neville Jones, The Origins of Strategic Bombing: A Study of the Development of British Air Strategic Thought and Practice up to 1918 (London: William Kimber, 1973), 205.

Additionally, Parker had an above average intellect capable of expanding strategic aviation thought, while not overstepping the Army’s limited vision of the airplane’s military potential. Parker delivered his response at the board’s meeting on 4 July 1917.  He redefined aerial bombing in a manner that was acceptable to AEF leadership.  He wrote that “the objective is to attack the supply of an enemy army, thereby preventing it from employing all of its means of combat.”142  Parker even provided an initial list of objectives and target types including: destroying enemy depots, factories, and lines of communications.  This application of air power was more in line with army expectations.  It offered support for the ground forces, while excluding the controversial language of independence contained in Mitchell’s original memorandum.  At the end of the board’s meeting that day, the members approved Parker’s recommendations and fo
