hile excluding the controversial language of independence contained in Mitchell’s original memorandum.  At the end of the board’s meeting that day, the members approved Parker’s recommendations and forwarded them to General Pershing.143   In this way, a myriad of sources worked on aerial strategy both alone and in coordination with others.  This system created four categories of strategy available to Pershing and his command staff in the late summer of 1917.  The Joint Army-Navy Technical Board provided a numerically driven plan based heavily on observation and pursuit.  The Bolling Commission modified this slightly by recommending the addition of an offensive aerial force for bombing support of ground forces.  Then, Mitchell added a Trenchard-inspired concept of an independent aerial offensive to the table.  Finally, through Parker, the Board of Officers redefined bombing into something more acceptable                                                 141 Maurer, U.S. Air Service in World War I, 123. 142 The Role of Aviation, report by Maj.

All of these options had to be filtered through the lenses of General Pershing and his senior staff, who often had deeply held convictions on the role of air power as a supporting force to the infantry soldier.  Still missing from the mix was a strategic bombing option similar to the earlier French proposals of 1915 or the British plans working their way through Parliament in the summer of 1917.     Sowing the Seeds of Strategic Bombing   As the Bolling Commission’s efforts drew to an end, Pershing sought to keep the best and brightest staff officers in Europe for the cadre of his rapidly forming AEF.  Between 1 and 15 August, Pershing promoted Gorrell to major, made him the Chief Engineer of the AEF Air Service, and placed him in
