staff officers in Europe for the cadre of his rapidly forming AEF.  Between 1 and 15 August, Pershing promoted Gorrell to major, made him the Chief Engineer of the AEF Air Service, and placed him in charge of the Technical Section.  This new position not only kept Gorrell in Paris, but it also placed him in charge of executing the aircraft purchase and support recommendations he contributed to during the Bolling Commission.  Between 1 August and 5 September 1917, Gorrell oversaw the acquisition of approximately $80 million worth of aircraft, engines, radios, guns, buildings, and even whiskey for the AEF Air Service.144    While this position was taxing, Gorrell rose to the occasion.  In an unpublished article on Gorrell, Maj. Gen. (Ret.) Orvil Anderson jokingly posited his importance: “at the end of this hectic period an entire boat load of people landed in France to take on the jobs that Gorrell had been holding down.”145  His success in the position quickly got him noticed by senior leaders in Europe, who admired his keen intellect and ability to think strategically.                                                  144 Holley, Ideas and Weapons, 83-84. 145 Edgar S.

File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 102 --- 96  Gorrell’s success also came to the attention of senior leaders in Washington.  In a memo to the Chief of the AEF Air Service General Kenly dated 9 October 1917, Bolling opposed a request to send Gorrell back to the capital to represent the Signal Corps on the General Staff.  His wording reflects his high esteem for Gorrell.  Bolling indicated, “Frankly, I do not see how we can get along without Maj Gorrell in France as his knowledge goes far beyond mere technical matters.  He does not confine his work merely to technical matters, but is my chief advisor on all matter requiring knowledge of military aviation.”146  Consequent
