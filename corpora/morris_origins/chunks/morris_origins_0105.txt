He does not confine his work merely to technical matters, but is my chief advisor on all matter requiring knowledge of military aviation.”146  Consequently, when Benjamin Foulois, now a brigadier general, arrived with senior personnel for the AEF Air Service staff, Pershing moved Gorrell to the AEF Air Service operations directorate.  In this new position, he led the development of aerial strategy for the service’s impending combat operations.  In this way, his duties transferred from the daily grind of logistics to more cerebral, but no less critical, planning responsibilities.

When examined in detail, we can see that Gorrell’s ideas represent a fusion between the changing American concept of bombing and the more advanced European attitudes in 1917.  Gorrell was perhaps the best-placed officer in the U.S. Army to watch the evolution of the internal debate on aerial strategy.  Before leaving the United States, his membership on the Joint Army-Navy Technical Board and Benjamin Foulois’s staff g
