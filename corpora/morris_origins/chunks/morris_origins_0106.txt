the U.S. Army to watch the evolution of the internal debate on aerial strategy.  Before leaving the United States, his membership on the Joint Army-Navy Technical Board and Benjamin Foulois’s staff gave him a solid foundation in debates about the force size and structure.  Once in Europe, Gorrell was perfectly situated to observe the doctrinal evolution of the AEF Air Service.  He was collocated in Paris with both Mitchell and the Board of Officers.  Additionally, his role on the Bolling Commission and later as Chief Engineer of AEF Air Services provided him with plenty of opportunities to discuss strategy with key staff members and to read the findings of the many different strategy boards.   In addition to closely observing the American deliberations, Gorrell’s foreign contacts molded his thoughts on the air weapon.  The most important of these was his close relationship with Lord Tiverton.  Hardinge Goulborn Goffard Tiverton, the second Earl of Halsbury, was a Royal Navy aviator assigned to the British Aviation Commission in Paris in 1917.  The British Commission was only a few blocks from the offices of the Bolling Commission in a requisitioned apartment house near the Arc de Triomphe.147  In both his time as Chief Engineer of the AEF Air Service and as an operational strategist, Gorrell often sought Tiverton’s advice.  This informal coordination blossomed into a friendship between the two aviators during the fall of 1917 and Tiverton became a leading confidant and advisor to Gorrell on strategic bombing.                                                 147 Williams, “Shank of the Drill,” 384.

His life followed a typical British upper-class trajectory including attending Eton and Oxford before becoming a barrister in 1906.  This traditional life changed rapidly when Britain declared war on Germany in 1914.  Tiverton left his law practice and entered the Royal Naval Air Service.
