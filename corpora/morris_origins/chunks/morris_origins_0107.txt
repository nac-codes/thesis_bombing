Tiverton left his law practice and entered the Royal Naval Air Service.  After serving briefly as an armament-training officer, he moved to No. 3 Wing of the RNAS at Luxeuil in the summer of 1916.148  No. 3 Wing was initially created to hinder German zeppelin production.  Yet, when the RFC became too heavily engaged in the Somme offensive to conduct their strategic mission against German military production facilities, the Navy expanded No. 3 Wing’s mission to include targeting German industrial targets.  As the wing’s armament officer, Tiverton was closely involved in the planning and target selection for the unit’s Sopwith 1 ½ Strutters and Shorts bombers.149  This mission suited Tiverton, who quickly evolved into the wing’s primary strategist. Unfortunately for Tiverton and the No. 3 Wing, the RFC successfully countered the RNAS expansion.  This opposition centered on two elements.  The first was traditional interservice rivalry.  The RFC did not look favorably on naval aircraft flying from ground bases in central France against targets deep in enemy territory.  While the RFC did not support strategic bombing per se, they saw it as their mission and viewed No. 3 Wing as an unwanted incursion into their domain.  More important, though, was the second issue of aircraft production.  Problems with production of the new Sopwith 1 ½ Strutter bomber and continuous high losses from the RFC’s offensive policies caused concern over a lack of suitable aircraft to support the Somme offensive.  Trenchard even complained to the Air Board that “if the Navy obtained large numbers of engines and                                                 148 Neville Jones, The Origins of Strategic Bombing, 22. 149 Bob Pearson, “More Than Would be Reasonably Anticipated: The Story of No. 3 Wing, RNAS,” Over The Front 13 (Winter 1998): 284.
