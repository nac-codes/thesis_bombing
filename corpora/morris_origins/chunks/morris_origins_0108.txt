By June 1917, the Navy decided Tiverton’s planning capabilities were needed elsewhere.  The RNAS transferred him to the Aviation Commission in Paris to work on a strategic bombardment policy for 1918.151  Tiverton worked closely with the RFC officers assigned to the commission and the French air staff to build recommendations for the equipment, training, and planning of a major bombing campaign in 1918.  When in the summer of 1917 the French started to focus more on tactical aviation and proved unhelpful in Tiverton’s mission, he turned to the new aviators in town, the Americans.  Tiverton worked hard to cultivate friendships with both members of the Bolling Commission and the early AEF Air Service staff officers. While Tiverton and Gorrell initially met as part of discussions on the feasibility of buying British bomber aircraft for the fledgling AEF Air Service, their shared interest in strategic bombing cemented a friendship.  In many respects, the more senior Tiverton served as a mentor to the younger Gorrell.  Tiverton had spent most of the summer of 1917 working on the Strategic Bombing Policy for the RNAS.  In September, he shared this policy memorandum with Gorrell.152  It is clear that the four themes of strategic bombing Tiverton identified struck a chord with Gorrell as they continually show up in his later writings.  It is too far of a leap, however, to say Gorrell simply took Tiverton’s ideas as his own.  The themes of objectives, offensive force, concentration, and morale                                                 150 Jones, The Origins of Strategic Bom
