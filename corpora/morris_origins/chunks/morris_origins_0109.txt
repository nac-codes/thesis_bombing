Perhaps it is best to think of Tiverton as a source of inspiration for the overworked young staff officer.  As many historians have noted, Gorrell copied large parts of Tiverton’s memorandum.  Yet, this does not necessarily mean he simply stole his ideas.  In the time-honored world of military staff work, copying others’ writing that makes one’s argument is simply good time management.  Lifted statements like “unquestionably, the greatest morale effect is by day, compared to night attacks when German workers are in their own houses” cannot be considered solely a British idea.  All air services held similar beliefs.  Thus, there is definitely an amalgamation of Tiverton’s work into Gorrell’s, but to claim it is the sole source seems a stretch. At the same time, the British were not the only source of international inspiration for Gorrell.  From his first visit to Italy with the Bolling Commission, Gorrell maintained a close relationship with Count Giovanni Battista Caproni, an aircraft designer and close friend of the Italian bombing theorist Giulio Douhet.153  During his initial trip to Italy in June 1917, Gorrell formed a relationship with Caproni.  This rapport, like that with Tiverton, took on a senior-mentor flavor.  Both men shared an interest in bombing, which they discussed on numerous occasions when Gorrell was in Italy.  Caproni’s journal mentions several conversations over dinner where he and Gorrell discussed air warfare and the role of bombing in destroying an enemy’s capability to fight.154 It appears Caproni captured Go
