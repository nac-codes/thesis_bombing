’s journal mentions several conversations over dinner where he and Gorrell discussed air warfare and the role of bombing in destroying an enemy’s capability to fight.154 It appears Caproni captured Gorrell’s imagination during these sessions.  In a memorandum dated 15 October 1917 to Colonel Bolling, Gorrell channeled Caproni’s                                                 153 J. L.

Sometime before 31 October, Caproni gave Gorrell the book Let Us Kill the War; Let Us Aim at the Heart of the Enemy.156  This book, reprinted in English, described how strategic bombing could destroy an enemy’s industry and civilian morale.  On 31 October, Gorrell wrote to Caproni thanking him for the book.  He again wrote on 17 November asking for more copies to share with his fellow aviators.  In this same letter, Gorrell also called on Caproni to recommend targets inside Germany for an American strategic bombardment campaign.157    Tiverton’s and Caproni’s influences on internal American debates are visible in Gorrell’s first two formal reports from Europe.  The Bolling Report on 15 August 1917 specifically highlighted the need to buy long-range bombardment aircraft to sustain a strategic effort.  Meanwhile, Go
