ell’s first two formal reports from Europe.  The Bolling Report on 15 August 1917 specifically highlighted the need to buy long-range bombardment aircraft to sustain a strategic effort.  Meanwhile, Gorrell’s companion memorandum to the Chief of the Signal Corps, Brigadier General Scriven, dated 27 September 1917, provided more information on the possibilities of bombing. 158  In the letter, Gorrell set the stage for his later proposal by describing the state of British, French, and Italian bombing efforts.  It is                                                 155 Gorrell Memorandum on the Caproni Contract, 15 October 1917, Bureau of Aircraft Production Hist. box 21, 425.1, National Archives. 156 Boone, “Italian Influence,” 146. 157 Gorrell to Caproni, 17 November 1917,  Call #168.661-86, IRIS #125201, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL. 158 Maurer, U.S. Air Service in World War I, 131-32.

Still, the memorandum demonstrated the strong influences from the British and Italians that formed the basis of Gorrell’s seminal Strategic Bombardment Plan of November 1917. In this way, it is clear that there was more than just one source of information guiding Gorrell’s thinking.  Yes, he did borrow heavily from Tiverton’s work for his own writings, but they were leavened with elements of American and Italian thought.  It is difficult to say exactly where Gorrell got each idea as his strategic bombing theory was just coalescing at the time.  It is most likely that he borrowed heavily from Tiverton because his paper contained three important elements that resonated with Gorrell.  First, it closely matched his own vision of strategic bombing.  Next, Tiverton’s work often mirrored the ideas of Caproni in his correspondence with Gorrell.  Finally, because it was written in English, Tiverton’s work was readily available and
