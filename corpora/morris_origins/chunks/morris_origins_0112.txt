trategic bombing.  Next, Tiverton’s work often mirrored the ideas of Caproni in his correspondence with Gorrell.  Finally, because it was written in English, Tiverton’s work was readily available and easy to include as the basis of his report.  This last consideration surely had the most appealed to Gorrell.  The Americanization of Strategic Bombing Gorrell’s strategic bombardment plan began to form as early as 15 August 1917 when Pershing selected him to lead the Air Service’s Technical Section.159  In this position, Gorrell led efforts to buy the combat aircraft required by the newly arriving American squadrons.  On the surface this may seem like a simple task, but no accepted concepts of air power employment existed in the AEF during the summer of 1917.  As Gorrell wrestled with the issue of what types and how many of each aircraft to buy, he                                                 159 Early History of the Strategical Section, by Col.

Gorrell’s linkages with the Bolling Commission, the Board of Officers, and foreign aviation theorists helped guide his thoughts.  The observation and pursuit missions were well developed, and the AEF leadership held definite opinions on those missions.  Therefore, they became straightforward problems for Gorrell to solve by simply matching the best European aircraft to each of the accepted mission sets.  Bombing was another issue.  While most nations utilized tactical bombing, strategic bombing was still largely theoretical, but this was changing rapidly.  The summer of 1917 saw an increase in strategic bombing planning, especially after the Germans started Gotha raids against England on 25 May 1917.160  It is likely the newness of bombing appealed to Gorrel
