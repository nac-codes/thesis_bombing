ummer of 1917 saw an increase in strategic bombing planning, especially after the Germans started Gotha raids against England on 25 May 1917.160  It is likely the newness of bombing appealed to Gorrell’s adventurism.  While still fulfilling his primary duties as chief of the technical section, Gorrell started to turn his attention to the problem of strategic bombardment.  Yet, this might have remained just a personal fascination if not for the consequences of AEF structural changes.  When Pershing received command of the American Expeditionary Force, he thought long and hard about whom his subordinate commanders should be.  For the Air Service, he favored Brig. Gen. Benjamin Foulois.  The two had built a professional relationship when Foulois served under Pershing in the Mexican Expedition as the commander of the 1st Aero Squadron.

Word spread quickly that a new commander was on his way with a large staff to take over operations.  Gorrell must have realized his junior rank of major likel
