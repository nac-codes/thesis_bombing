nly as the Chief of the AEF Air Service.  Word spread quickly that a new commander was on his way with a large staff to take over operations.  Gorrell must have realized his junior rank of major likely meant he would lose his posting to a more senior officer.  A memorandum from Bolling to Howard Coffin just two days before Foulois’s arrival supports this assessment.  In the memo, Bolling indicated that his staff was excited about the new officers, as they had been severely undermanned.  Yet, at the same time there was apprehension over transitioning new senior officers into key staff billets.162  With this air of uncertainty as a backdrop, Gorrell started codifying his thoughts into a formal proposal to present to Foulois on his arrival.  As many expected, Foulois showed up in November with a large cadre of senior officers to supplant the existing command structure.  On 21 November 1917, seven new officers arrived at the technical section.  One of them, Lt. Col.

With the heavy workload of buying aircraft, setting up airdromes, and training personnel, the staff had paid scant attention to how to use the Air Service in combat.  Gorrell was ready to meet this concern.  Following Mitchell’s example, he presented his proposed strategic bombing plan on 28 November 1917, only a day after Foulois assumed command of the AEF Air Service.164  The plan must have met his intentions because Foulois rapidly approved it before combining it with other proposals to forwa
