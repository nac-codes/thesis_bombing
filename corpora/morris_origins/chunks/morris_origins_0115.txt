r 1917, only a day after Foulois assumed command of the AEF Air Service.164  The plan must have met his intentions because Foulois rapidly approved it before combining it with other proposals to forward to Pershing.  Foulois’s own note to AEF Chief of Staff Harbord on 1 December 1917 indicated that his staff had been working on “the air policy to be recommended for adoption by the American Forces for the past ten days and would forward it to HQ AEF soon.”165  Gorrell’s proposal was part of this overall air policy package that arrived at Pershing’s office in early December 1917.  A large portion of the document borrowed heavily from Tiverton’s British bombing proposal, but there were differences.  Gorrell started his plan differently from the British version.  The American introduction sounded more like a sales pitch to the AEF senior leadership.  This emphasized a major problem American strategic bombing advocates faced in the fall of 1917; senior Army leaders still viewed air power as primarily a support function for ground operations.  Therefore, Gorrell used a two-pronged methodology to garner the attention of senior commanders.   First, he made an argument that bombing could help the U.S. Army win the war.  Historian George Williams best describes his logic: “land battle is in stalemate; artillery is the key to the land battle; ammunition production is the key to artillery; factories are                                                 164 Early History, 28 November 1917, Gorrell Hist, B-6, 373. 165 Memo, Foulois to AEF Chief of Staff, 1 December 1917, Sec A-1, in Gorrell History, 9.

Next, Gorrell alluded to the German bombing effort agains
