6  While not expressed quite as succinctly, Gorrell’s introduction made a similar point as to how strategic bombing would facilitate victory.  Next, Gorrell alluded to the German bombing effort against Britain in the summer of 1917.  The Gotha campaign against Britain, and London in particular, was changing how military leaders and politicians viewed air power.  The Trenchard and Mitchell vision of strategical aviation as the semi-independent use of aircraft in a primarily interdiction role behind the front lines to support ground offensives was challenged by a new strategic vision of air power as a potential tool to break an enemy’s industrial might and will to fight thus ending a war without the need for a ground victory.  While the British led the way in this thinking mainly due to the civilian clamor for revenge and a political fear of industrial and morale damage from the bombing, other aviators were starting to garner an appreciation for strategic bombing.         Gorrell was one of the first Americans to discuss the strategic implications of the Gotha campaigns.  He made three conclusions in his memorandum concerning the German campaign.  First, if the Allies did not respond the Germans would hurt allied industries, while their own remained safe.  Next, the Germans had the geographical advantage of proximity to allied industry to make their task easier than the American one.  With the front lines in France, bombing German industrial cities required long, dangerous flights, whereas French and British industrial cities were only relatively short flights away from German bases in France and Belgium.  Finally, the Germans had the biggest                                                 166 Williams, “Shank of the Drill,” 403.
