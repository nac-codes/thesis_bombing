--- 107 advantage of all: “the Germans words were being rapidly turned into deeds.”167  In this way, Gorrell created two rationales for why America had to pursue strategic bombing:  it would help win the war; and there had to be a response to German strategic bombing.   Gorrell went on to explain his campaign plan in four steps, which borrowed heavily from Tiverton’s four themes but also made sense from the American perspective.  First, the AEF Air Service needed to separate strategic bombing from the tactical forces.  Independence would ensure the strategic forces focused purely on their mission without interference.  Next, the strategic forces needed to identify and prioritize target areas that would cause the most damage to enemy production.  Then, the Air Service should concentrate bomber bases in the proper area to support concentrated attacks against those target areas.  Last, the planning staff needed to structure operations to focus attacks on one target per day to maximize both destruction and the morale effects of bombing.168  Contained within these four steps are the foundations of American strategic bombing: independence, targeting, and concentration.  There was one key difference between Gorrell’s recommendation and Tiverton’s.  In keeping with the earlier Board of Officers’ recommendation, Gorrell supported a system of round-the-clock bombing against German targets in order to “give the Germans no rest from our aerial activities and no time to repair the damage inflicted.”169  This position diverged from the British who favored night operations to limit aircraft losses.   Gorrell’s position on daylight bombing may seem out of place considering the lessons Allied aviators took from the earlier German raids.  High aircraft losses also                                                 167 Early History, 28 November 1917, Gorrell Hist, B-6, 373. 168 Ibid., 376-78. 169 Ibid., 380.
