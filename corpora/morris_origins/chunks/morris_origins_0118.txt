Still, as George Williams points out, this American position may have been a combination of theory and real-world practicality.171  From his time as the Chief of the Air Service’s Technical Section Gorrell must have understood the realities of bomber aircraft production and delivery timelines.  The primary planned daylight bomber, the DH-4, was already in production in Britain with allotments for delivery to the AEF Air Service scheduled, meanwhile the Handley Page night bomber required the delivery of Liberty engines from America.  Hence, they were not scheduled to arrive in the AEF Air Service operational units until May 1918.172  This meant that daylight bombers would arrive at the front months before night bombers.  Starting daytime operations would not only take the fight to the enemy sooner, but it would also provide pilots with experience navigating far behind the front lines without the extra complication of darkness.  While daylight losses might be higher, the Americans felt this tradeoff was worth the cost. Gorrell returned to his salesmanship in the conclusion of his proposal.  While this last section was brief, it was a clarion call to action.  A single sentence in the section sums up the entire proposal’s urgency: “Unless a decision is made to commence it immediately, we cannot hope to operate during 1918.”173  This tone must have resonated with Pershing who approved Gorrell’s plan on 5 January 1918.                                                 170 Morrow, German Air Power, 162. 171 Williams, “Shank of the Drill,” 401. 172 Memorandum to Air Service Chief of Staff, 18 January 1918, A-15, in
