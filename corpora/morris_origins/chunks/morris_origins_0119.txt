Years later Gen. Laurence S. Kuter described Gorrell’s 28 November 1917 plan as the “earliest, clearest, and least known statement of the American conception of the employment of airpower.”175  Yet Kuter’s description belies the complicated mixture of historical precedent, new thinking, and wartime realities that underlay the plan.
