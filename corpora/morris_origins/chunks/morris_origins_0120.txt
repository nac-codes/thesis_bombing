At the same time, European air power strategists connected with their new allies to structure American air power.  Men like Caproni, Trenchard, and Tiverton shared their visions for strategic air power with up-and-coming members of the AEF Air Service during that critical summer and fall.  In this way, they conveyed three years of aviation thought and development to the newly arrived American strategist. Finally, the realities of the battlefield played a role in shaping American strategic doctrine.  By 1917, senior leaders understood this was an industrial war where the ability to keep armies fed, supplied, and fighting was of critical importance.  The idea of attacking the source of supply in the enemy’s factories and transportation system appealed to almost all leaders.  Still, aircraft were a limited asset that required husbanding to ensure they were available when needed.  The Gotha raids on England during the summer of 1917 helped spur changes to this traditional way of thinking.  Without a response, the Allies risked letting the Germans gain the advantage in this new form of industrial warfare.  Consequently, leaders slowly became open to risking air power in deep strikes against enemy resources.   All three factors came together at the right place and right time for Gorrell.  His background not only opened him to the possibilities of strategic aviation, but also led him to address the problems at hand for the American air service.  His connections with key strategists in the American, Italian, French, a
