After suffering injuries that limited his ability to fly, the British assigned Wing Commander Spencer Grey to assist the American airmen on 30 October 1917.177  Gorrell himself stated that Grey was then considered “the world’s greatest authority on aerial bombardment,” having commanded both day and night bombing squadrons in the Royal Naval Air Service.178  Therefore, Gorrell sought and garnered Grey’s assignment to the Strategical Aviation in the Zone of Advance.

On 19 July 1917, Smuts addressed the issue of protecting London from air raids by advocating the coordination of air defense under one command.  He then went one step further on 17 August by recommending a complete restructuring of the air services into an independent air force combining the RNAS and the RFC.
