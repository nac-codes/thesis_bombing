estructuring of the air services into an independent air force combining the RNAS and the RFC.  This new Royal Air Force (RAF) would maintain the previous ground and naval support roles, but Smuts specifically recommended adding an independent long-range bombing mission against German cities and industry.  He believed this new focus would turn the RAF into a force capable of winning the war through aerial bombardment. While many disagreed, Smuts had two aces in the hole.  First, he had the public pressure for revenge against Germany on his side.  More important, he had help countering the old argument that there were not enough aircraft to meet ground, naval, and bombing needs simultaneously.  Shortly after the Smuts report, the Chairman of the Air Board Sir Weetman Pearson, the First Viscount of Cowdray, released a study indicating production increases would result in a large surplus of aircraft by the summer of 1918.180   This new information helped quell some of the dissension based on limited                                                 179 Neville Jones, The Origins of Strategic Bombing: A Study of the Development of British Air Strategic Thought and Practice up to 1918 (London: William Kimber, 1973), 135. 180 H.

Meanwhile, public pressure helped convince many political leaders to overcome British Army and Royal Navy resistance to the formation of the RAF.  This change in governmental direction was not lost on the field commanders, who also felt pressure to respond in kind to the German bombing attacks.  On 11 October 1917, after receiving orders to begin the bombing of targets in Germany, Trenchard authorized the creation of 41 Wing under the command of Lt. Col. Cyril Newall at Ochey, France.  The wing had the primary mission of conducting bombing raids against German cities.181
