Nevertheless, the conference proved useful in determining each nation’s readiness to participate in a combined bomber offensive.  The British led the effort with their proposal for a strategic campaign against German industrial cities with a combined bomber force based in the Nancy area.  The French did not support the British, feeling the plan was too difficult to achieve in 1918 without pulling resources away from the ground battles.  Additionally, the French feared German retaliation would cause more damage to their factories than the allied bombing would to German industry.  Finally, Gorrell expressed an American desire to participate in the effort, but also showed his tenuous position when he announced that he could not pledge support without first garnering the approval of the AEF commander.185  Gorrell and Foulois followed up the conference with a visit to Trenchard’s headquarters over Christmas.
