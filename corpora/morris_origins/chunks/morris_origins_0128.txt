Once, the Americans fielded enough squadrons to form their own group, Trenchard recommended they operate as an American bombing group under the British wing.  Eventually, when the Americans had the preponderance of bomber forces in a region, Trenchard indicated his desire to turn over command of that region to the American Air Service with the remaining British forces coming under U.S. command.186   This plan offered many benefits for the growing AEF Air Service.  First, there was the obvious learning value of flying under the tutelage of experienced British pilots.  Additionally, cohabitation on British bases would lessen the numbers of American airfields needed in the resource-constrained environment.  Finally, collocating with the British offered the use of their superior maintenance and supply systems.  As the U.S. supply system was struggling just to deploy and provision the Army, this promise of logistical support must have seemed ideal to Gorrell and Foulois.  Yet, the plan met with stiff resistance at the AEF staff level.  The American generals saw the subjugation of U.S. forces, even air forces, under a British commander as problematic.  This is evidenced by a report Foulois sent to the AEF Chief of Staff on 23 December 1917.  After describing the British progression towards strategic bombing that fall, Foulois warned the staff that the British Air Ministry and the British War Cabinet were preparing a communication to be referred to the Commander in Chief, AEF recommending that the British, French, and American air services take the necessary steps to integrate into a combined strategic offensive against German industry.  Maj. Gen. James W. McAndrew, the AEF Chief of Staffâ€™s, responsed to the memo, recommending                                                 186 Maurer Maurer,  U.S. Air Service in World War I (Washington, DC: O
