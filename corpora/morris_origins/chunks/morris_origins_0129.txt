James W. McAndrew, the AEF Chief of Staff’s, responsed to the memo, recommending                                                 186 Maurer Maurer,  U.S. Air Service in World War I (Washington, DC: Office of Air Force History, 1978), 152.

Although Pershing had approved Gorrell’s initial proposal, his staff began to worry about the independent nature of the bomber force.  Just as Mitchell learned after his initial air strategy proposal, the AEF command staff would not accept an independent air force.  The December conference entrenched this viewpoint, as it not only spoke of an independent bomber force, but also of subordinating that force to a British-led effort.  This dual affront likely made many staff officers drop any support they may have had for strategic bombing. Gorrell surely felt the sting of this attitude change.  Despite his best efforts, he faced long delays in both policy decisions and aircraft deliveries.  He even argued that the AEF staff deliberately saddled him with many additional duties to keep him closely tied to their command structure.188  In a first attempt to fix the situation, Gorrell wrote a memorandum to Foulois on 2 January 1918.  In the memo, he contended that the AEF command structure must coordinate with the Allies and take tangible steps to provide aircraft, pilots, and bases for the force to start operations.189    This memorandum likely ruffled feathers in the AEF headquarters.  It included not only a critique of staff support, but also called for independent bomber operations and even subornation to the British e
