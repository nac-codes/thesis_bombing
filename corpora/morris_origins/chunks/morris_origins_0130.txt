s memorandum likely ruffled feathers in the AEF headquarters.  It included not only a critique of staff support, but also called for independent bomber operations and even subornation to the British effort.  While this opinion likely won Gorrell favor with                                                 187 Memo, Foulois to Chief of Staff, 23 December 1917, Sec A-1, in Gorrell History, 135. 188 Early History, 28 December 1918, 395. 189 Ibid., 396-98.

This anger seems to have caught Gorrell by surprise, and he he rapidly took steps to modify his proposal to win back staff support.  Sometime between late December 1917 and the end of January 1918 Gorrell wrote a second proposal on strategic bombing titled “The Future Role of American Bombardment Aviation.”190  Gorrell once again turned to the British, copying heavily from Trenchard’s December 1917 report to the War Cabinet.  Despite lifting entire paragraphs from the British document, this policy memorandum contained more American ideas than his previous one.  In many ways, it reflects Gorrell’s attempt to update his 28 November recommendation to match senior U.S. leadership concerns more closely.   To accomplish this, Gorrell used a three-part approach.  First, he tried to assuage concerns about independence.  In the first paragraph, he paid homage to a single unified Army effort by claiming that “the Air Service is an integral part of a homogeneous team, no portion of which, working by itself, can alone decisively defeat the enemy.”191  He then continued the theme, often comparing air power to a long-range gun and describing how strategic aviation could help sway the outcome of a battle.   Next, he eschewed his earlier advocacy of aviation’s ability to win a war directly by suggesting that strategic bombing would make the infantry’s job on the battlefield easier.  He challenged commanders to envision
