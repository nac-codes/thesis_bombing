wed his earlier advocacy of aviation’s ability to win a war directly by suggesting that strategic bombing would make the infantry’s job on the battlefield easier.  He challenged commanders to envision “what would happen if communications were destroyed, supplies of rations and material cut, and if reserve troops were subjected                                                 190 Original contains no date.  Note: Mark Clodfelter, Beneficial Bombing footnote 46 indicates it was likely written in February or March 1918, but this would push the document’s origins beyond Gorrell’s tenure as Chief of Strategical Aviation in the Zone of Advance, which ended on 21 January 1918.   191 The Future Role of American Bombardment Aviation, by Edgar S. Gorrell, circa Dec 1917 to Jan 1918, Call# 248.222-78, IRIS# 00161162, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL, 1.

Finally, Gorrell added a new element: the morale effect of bombing.  In his discussion of daylight versus nighttime bombing, Gorrell spelled out the tradeoffs between the two.  Daylight bombing caused more damage, but also meant more losses.  Nighttime bombing lowered losses, but also caused less accuracy and damage.  Gorrell argued that this was not a tradeoff the U.S. Army had to make.  Previewing future thought, he contended that daylight missions flown in large formations with escorts would keep losses at acceptable levels.  Meanwhile, the morale effect of bombing both in daytime and at night would offset the limited physical damage from night bombing.193  This morale effect is perhaps the most interesting part of Gorrell’s new recommendation.  His earlier correspondence with Tiverton and Caproni indicated he knew of both men’s views that morale effects might be greater than physical destruction, but he had not addressed the
