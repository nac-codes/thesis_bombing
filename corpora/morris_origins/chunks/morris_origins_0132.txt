recommendation.  His earlier correspondence with Tiverton and Caproni indicated he knew of both men’s views that morale effects might be greater than physical destruction, but he had not addressed them in writing until this point.  Gorrell used two examples to support his argument that even if bombers missed their targets, they would still produce enough discontent and alarm to disrupt production.  He cited British statistics of factory man-hour losses due to evacuations during the Gotha raids and French reports on their labor difficulties after German raids near Pont-St Vincent.  Concerning the French raids, Gorrell wrote that “though they have never interrupted the work for more than a few hours, it has become increasingly difficult to persuade the workmen to remain.”194   Consequently, Gorrell modified his earlier core components of strategic bombing.  Target selection and concentration remained his chief focus, but he toned down                                                 192 Ibid., 4. 193 Ibid., 10. 194 Ibid., 15.

Additionally, he added a psychological element by arguing that the morale effects of bombardment were as important as physical destruction.  While Gorrell cannot claim to have created any of these concepts, he does deserve credit for linking them in a formal policy proposal for a uniquely American vision of air power.   Despite Gorrell’s effort to meet American concerns, his second bombing proposal fell on deaf ears.  This likely occurred for three reasons.  First, Gorrell’s earlier memorandum caused too much bad blood with senior AEF staff officers.  With their feathers already ruffled, they were likely predisposed to look unfavorably on any new strategic bombing proposal even with Gorrell’s new terminology limiting independence or war-winning capabilities.  Next, by early 1918 aircraft production shortages were readily observable to the AEF staff.  Gorrell’s
