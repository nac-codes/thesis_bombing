proposal even with Gorrell’s new terminology limiting independence or war-winning capabilities.  Next, by early 1918 aircraft production shortages were readily observable to the AEF staff.  Gorrell’s new proposal must have seemed like an extravagant use of limited bombing aircraft that ground commanders wanted for direct support.  Finally, Gorrell’s close ties to the British caused consternation as many senior army officers likely saw his recommendations as the first step in losing command of their bomber forces to a multinational independent bombing command led by the British.   Given this convergence of forces, Gorrell faced an impossible task in creating a strategic bombing force and utilizing it in a major campaign.  Thus, Pershing removed him from command of Strategical Aviation in the Zone of Advance on 21 January 1918 and moved him to the AEF G3 operations staff.195  He still worked on long-range bombing policy, but his location outside the Air Service proper severely limited his influence on future operations.  Gorrell eventually worked his way back into the Air                                                 195 Early History, 28 November 1917, Sec B-6, 398.

Consequently, the removal of Gorrell effectively killed any strategic bombing campaign during 1918 as the Army and the Air Service turned their attention towards ground combat.  With resources limited, bombing lay at the short end of operational planning and logistics systems.  Nevertheless, the idea of strategic bombing did not completely die out and continued to simmer just below the surface in the minds of many air power leaders.  When projections for 1919 finally showed a significant increase in the numbers of bomber aircraft available, many AEF Air Service planners began to recons
