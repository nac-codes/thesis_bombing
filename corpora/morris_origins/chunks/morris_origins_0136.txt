ffensive elements it could ensure victory.198   This preface indicated that Mitchell had come down on the opposite side of the doctrinal debate from Gorrell.  Whereas Gorrell espoused a strategic war-winning role for air power, Mitchell sided with Trenchard’s and Pershing’s vision of a ground-centric mission.    This is interesting, as both men had discussed aviation theory with many of the same British, French, and Italian bombing advocates.  Gorrell and Mitchell even had a cordial rapport during their shared time on the Air Service staff where Mitchell read Gorrell’s proposals.  According to Maj. Gen. Mason Patrick their relationship did not sour until the summer of 1918 when Mitchell became angry when Gorrell coordinated surprise inspections of Mitchell’s units while they were involved in combat operations.199  Given this relationship, it is possible that Gorrell’s failure in advocating a strategic mission might have encouraged Mitchell to adopt the ground-centric doctrine he was already predisposed to from his study of Trenchard’s air power vision.  Either way, Mitchell’s new strategy effectively avoided Gorrell’s pitfalls of complete independence and claims of war-winning capabilities that so agitated the senior AEF.      Still, it would be a mistake to claim that Mitchell’s strategy was a reaction to Gorrell’s proposal.  Instead, it represented a fusion of the concepts he had learned during the previous year in Europe.   For instance, Mitchell appropriated elements of Trenchard’s conception of air power as an integral element in a ground-offensive-based                                                 198 Ibid.  199 Robert P.

Historian Alfred Hurley suggests Mitchell saw the close relationship between Tenchard and Haig as directly linked to both men’s steadfast determination to s
