Historian Alfred Hurley suggests Mitchell saw the close relationship between Tenchard and Haig as directly linked to both men’s steadfast determination to support a ground-centric plan for winning the war.200  It is possible that Mitchell saw direct support of Pershing’s plan as a method to garner a similar close relationship with Pershing.  Of course that is not the only possibility.  Thomas Wildenberg offers a different model.  He suggests that “Mitchell took to Trenchard’s ideas about air power like a duck takes to water.”201  Hence, Wildenberg paints Mitchell as more of a true believer in a ground-centric strategy.  Whether it was an attempt to gain favor with the AEF senior leadership, to emulate the British model, or an acceptance of the reality of the need for ground support, Mitchell’s strategy offered a different role for air power than the one Gorrell proposed. In May 1918, Mitchell’s vision received an unexpected boost when Pershing removed Foulois as the Chief of the AEF Air Service and replaced him with Brig. Gen. Mason Patrick.  There had long been a sour relationship between Foulois and Mitchell.  Often considered rivals in the Air Service before its entry into World War I, Mitchell and Foulois clashed when Foulois arrived in Europe more than six months after him and was placed in command of the AEF Air Service.  This dislike turned into an outright war between the two men with the release of General Order No. 81 on 29 May.   Besides formally replacing Foulois with Patrick, the order also modified the Air Service command structure.  Previously it was divided into the Zone of the Interior and the Zone of the Advance.  The Zone of the Interior was responsible for pilot training,                                                 200 Alfred F.
