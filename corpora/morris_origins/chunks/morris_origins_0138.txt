Meanwhile, the Zone of the Advance was the combat arm of the American air service.  It oversaw the pursuit, observation, and bombardment aircraft supporting the ground forces and battling for aerial supremacy over the battlefield.  By the spring of 1918, this command structure no longer met the AEF’s needs.  While the Zone of the Interior remained a viable structure for supply, training, and administration duties, a single aerial combat command structure seemed to limit the ground commander’s control over aviation and even hinted at an independent role for the air service.  Therefore, General Order No. 81 disbanded the Zone of the Advance command.  Instead, each army would have its own air units commanded by a Chief of the Air Service.202   Mitchell considered the order a demotion and a slap in the face.  General Order No. 81 eliminated his position as Commander of the Zone of Advance and specified that Foulois was to become the Chief of the Air Service for 1st Army with Mitchell as his subordinate in the position of Chief of Air Operations for the 1st Corps.203  As might be expected, the new commands and their close proximity only exacerbated the feud between the two men.  Foulois documented one of the resulting exchanges in his memoirs.  He described a strong-headed Mitchell refusing to release his staff, supplies, and equipment to Foulois upon his arrival to take command of the 1st Army Air Service.  The situation had to be resolved eventually by calling in the 1st Army Chief of Staff to order the two men to resolve the situation.204
