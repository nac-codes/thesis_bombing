and chafed under the rigid regulations of Army life.206  By July, Mitchell had become a celebrity in the AEF Air Service by successfully demonstrating his superior capability to motivate these young men and to organize them into formations capable of countering German air power.  Not just Pershing, but also Mitchell’s old adversary Foulois noticed this superior leadership.  In a stunning turnaround and a statement about his professionalism, Foulois asked for                                                 205 White, Mason Patrick, 20. 206 Hurley, Billy Mitchell, 34.

His operational focus on ground support left little room for thinking or planning for strategic bombing operations.  Additionally, logistical problems continued to slow the arrival of bomber aircraft to the front-line units.  While DH-4 daylight bombers were starting to arrive, Mitchell’s ground-centric strategy meant most were assigned to squadrons with a direct ground support mission.  Night bomber production was even worse.  A delay in the production of Liberty engines slowed the delivery of British-produced Handley Page bombers to the American Air Service well into the summer of 1918.  Production plans called for the delivery of fifty engines to the British factory in May 1918 for the production of long-range night bombers for the Americans; however, by August only ten engines had arrived.208  Even if the Air Service had the extra bombers, it did not have the aircrews to fly them.  With a greater emphasis on ground support came greater losses of observation and bomber aircraft.  Much as the British experienced over the Somme, the American Air Service discovered it had an aircrew shortage during the summer of 1918.  All of these issues combined to drive strategic bombing t
