t.  Much as the British experienced over the Somme, the American Air Service discovered it had an aircrew shortage during the summer of 1918.  All of these issues combined to drive strategic bombing to the background during the spring and summer of 1918. Thus, by July 1918 American strategic bombing advocates had reached a low point.  During that month, the AEF staff decided to change the name of the Strategical Aviation, Zone of Advance to the G.H.Q. Air Service Reserve.209  While the name change was partially a response to the restructuring dictated by General Order No. 81, it                                                 207 Ibid., 34. 208 Memorandum to Air Service Chief of Staff, 18 January 1918, A-15, in Gorrell history, 122. 209 Early History of the Strategical Section, 28 December 1919, Sec B-6, 401.

This effectively brought home the realization that bombardment aviation, at least for the time being, was to be used only in support of ground operations as directed by the AEF headquarters.  While the name change signaled the end of Gorrell’s dream of a large bomber command in 1918, it perfectly positioned Mitchell to develop a concept for offensive air operations to support the planned American counteroffensive.  First at St. Mihiel and then later in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, Mitchell masterfully integrated reconnaissance, bombardment, and pursuit aviation in support of ground forces.  Perhaps the most interesting element of Mitchell’s plan was the independent nature of his air forces.  Mitchell successfully convinced senior ground commanders that his squadrons had to operate independently of division and corps commanders in order to gain initial aerial superiority over the front.  Of course, he was far too experienced and politically savvy to push for a totally independent command.  Instead, Mitchell mainta
