commanders in order to gain initial aerial superiority over the front.  Of course, he was far too experienced and politically savvy to push for a totally independent command.  Instead, Mitchell maintained his linkages to ground commanders by ensuring that as the pursuit aircraft were accomplishing their mission, the air commander would simultaneously use bombardment aviation to interdict the flow of reinforcements and supplies and provide intelligence through direct aerial observation missions.210  In this way, Mitchell built a balanced air strategy that included a level of autonomy, but maintained the ground combat focus required to garner the support of senior American military leaders.   Nevertheless, Mitchell’s plans were not the only potential course for air power development.  While Gorrell’s bombing proposal may have been shelved, the British continued to work on their own plan.  While this strategy became entangled in the                                                 210 Aviation Annex to First Army Field Order, 17 September 1918, Gorrell History, Sec. N-2, 330-35.

On 1 April 1918, the RFC and RNAS formally combined into the RAF.  The new independent air force faced stiff pressure from the public and the British government to conduct strategic attacks against German cities for both reprisal and industrial destruction.  Therefore, the Air Council recommended creating an independent bomber force under the RAF and operating outside British Army control with a purely strategic bombing mission.  As might be expected, this would be a difficult operation both to sell to the British Army leadership and to organize and execute in a short time.  The Air Council saw only one man for the job: Hugh Trenchard.  After a brief stint as the first Chief of the Air Staff fr
