l to the British Army leadership and to organize and execute in a short time.  The Air Council saw only one man for the job: Hugh Trenchard.  After a brief stint as the first Chief of the Air Staff from January to April, Trenchard had resigned his post after conflicts over the role of the new RAF.  Consequently, the most experienced British air commander was without a job when the Air Council started looking for their new commander.  The government rapidly approved both the independent force and cajoled Trenchard into accepting its command.  On 13 May 1918, he was officially assigned as the commander of the new Independent Force.211  The debate then shifted gears into defining the Independent Force’s mission.  Under the guidance of Chief of the Air Staff, Gen. Fredrick Sykes, the Air Staff produced a paper for the War Cabinet in mid-May outlining a proposed strategy. The top priority for the force was what he called “strategic interception,” which he defined as “attacking the root industries and morale of the enemy nation” 212 He went on to offer two means to                                                 211 Jones, Origins of Strategic Bombing, 178. 212 Richard J.

First, Sykes proposed bombing specific industrial systems to attack the enemy’s means of war.  In this way, the bomber force would focus on critical industries like weapons assembly, coal production, or iron manufacturing.  Second, Sykes recommended bombing densely populated industrial centers to disrupt work schedules and destroy the enemy’s morale.  At this point, Tiverton reentered the strategic bombing discussion with a memorandum to Sykes dated 22 May 1918.  In
