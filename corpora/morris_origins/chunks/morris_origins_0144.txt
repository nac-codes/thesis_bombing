lated industrial centers to disrupt work schedules and destroy the enemy’s morale.  At this point, Tiverton reentered the strategic bombing discussion with a memorandum to Sykes dated 22 May 1918.  In the memo, he pointed out that while Sykes’s earlier paper had dealt with bombing policy, it was no substitute for an actual plan.  Tiverton warned that if the British truly wanted to conduct a bombing campaign in 1918, they needed to develop a working plan in a short amount of time.213  Sykes agreed wholeheartedly with Tiverton and appointed him to prepare such a document.  Tiverton spent most of June 1918 working on a new bombing campaign.  This new proposal followed the lines of his previous ones by focusing on industrial targets and area bombardment around densely populated worker housing.  Tiverton’s dream may have finally become a reality except for the actions of the 8th Brigade commander, Brig. Gen. Cyril Newell.  Upon hearing of Tiverton’s plan, Newell drafted his own study of the strategic problem for the Chief of the Air Staff.  In his study, titled “The Scientific and Methodical Attack of Vital Industries,” Newell concluded that the first priority for any air campaign must be to gain air superiority, without which bombers operating at long ranges over German cities would face unsustainable losses from air defenses.  Only once control of the air was assured could the British bombers attack their targets freely.  Next, Newell contended that Tiverton’s                                                 213 Memo, Tiverton to Chief of the Air Staff, 22 May 1918, AIR 1/460, 15/312/101, NAUK.

Instead, he argued that if the enemy could not get their supplies and weapons to the front they were of no use.  Therefore, he proposed targeting rail and transportation networks as the first priority, with industrial factories as a distant third
