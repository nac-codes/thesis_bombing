get their supplies and weapons to the front they were of no use.  Therefore, he proposed targeting rail and transportation networks as the first priority, with industrial factories as a distant third priority.214    Newell’s ideas ignited a debate on the proper strategy for the new Independent Force.  His ideas held much promise.  The concept of winning air superiority to enable other missions was gaining rapid acceptance in all allied air forces, as evidenced by the previous discussion of Mitchell’s strategy evolution.  Additionally, Newell’s plan matched more closely Trenchard’s view of a ground-centric war.  When it came time to decide on the actual strategy, the new Independent Force commander sided with Newell.  Historian Neville Jones suggests that a combination of French pressures to focus on operational bombing and Trenchard’s own bias towards supporting Haig’s vision of a ground war shaped his decision.215  The new AEF Air Service Commander Mason Patrick reinforced this assessment in his postwar memoirs where he recalled Trenchard telling him that “he had fought for several years against the independent show, but that it had been forced on him.”216  In light of this attitude, it is likely Trenchard continued to focus on supporting his old boss General Haig, even in his new independent command.  The Independent Force became operational on 5 June 1918 when Trenchard took over command of the 8th Brigade.  The unit consisted of two flying wings:  No. 41 Wing flying three squadrons of daylight bombers; and No. 83 Wing with two squadrons of                                                 214 The Scientific and Methodical Attack of Vital Industries, staff study by Brig.
