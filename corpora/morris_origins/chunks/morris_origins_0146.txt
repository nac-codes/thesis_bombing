The statistics of the force’s operations indicate Newell’s and Trenchard’s visions drove bombing operations.  Throughout the summer and fall, the Independent Force struck industrial targets in only 20 percent of its missions.  Meanwhile, airfields represented 30 percent of the missions and railways dominated at 50 percent.218  While these numbers may not coincide with a modern viewpoint of strategic operations, when filtered through Trenchard’s vision and the dominance of the ground war they make more sense.  Railway targets seemed to offer the best of both worlds, as they inhibited the flow of war materials to the enemy’s military forces, while representing much less risky missions for the always-scarce bomber crews.  Interestingly, when Trenchard did focus on industrial targets, destruction was often a secondary purpose.  In late May, he sent a memorandum to the Chief of the Air Ministry describing his strategy for a strategic bombing campaign in 1919.  He wrote that “the aim of the Air Force is to break down the enemy’s means to resist by attacks on objectives selected as the most likely to achieve this end.”219  Hidden within this statement was a sobering take on the morale effects of bombing.  Under Trenchard’s policy, using bombing to drive workers from their homes and factories was a legitimate military objective that was much easier to achieve than destroying a factory.  Trenchard even put a ratio to this idea when he advocated that the psychological yield of bombing was about twenty times the level of physical destruction achieved.220                                                 217 Alan Morris, First of the Many: The Story of Independent Force, RAF (London: Jarrolds, 1968), 64. 218 Jones, Origins
