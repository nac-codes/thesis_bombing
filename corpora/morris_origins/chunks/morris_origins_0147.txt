The most dramatic change occurred in the long-range night bomber mission.  While on the AEF G3 staff Gorrell continued to work in the background to build the forces needed for a new strategic bombing campaign in 1919 once aircraft production caught up to plans.  On 26 January 1918, Gorrell helped negotiate the Rothermere-Foulois agreement, which detailed not only the British production of Handley-Page bombers for the Americans, but also enabled the British to train American bomber crews. While production delays slowed the progress, by 28 June 1918, Patrick established a Night Bombing Section to oversee the formation and basing of these new American long-range night bombardment squadrons along the front.  The plans called for the establishment of the first two squadrons in November 1918, with a total of eighteen operational squadrons by April 1919.221  This new force became the backbone on which to build the proposed 1919 strategic bombing campaign.  Meanwhile, daylight bombardment proceeded at a more rapid pace.  The first American daylight bombing squadron, the 96th Aero Squadron, began operations with ten Breguet 14B-2 bombers on 12 June 1918.222  Unlike the night bombing section, the daylight bombers had to contend with the heavy demand for direct support of ground forces.  Thus, the 96th lagged behind its British and French counterparts in the types of missions flown.  During that summer, the squadron’s
