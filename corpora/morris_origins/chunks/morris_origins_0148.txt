contend with the heavy demand for direct support of ground forces.  Thus, the 96th lagged behind its British and French counterparts in the types of missions flown.  During that summer, the squadronâ€™s single-engine Breguets seldom ventured more than sixty miles behind enemy lines, preferring relatively safe targets like railway stations and supply depots behind the front lines, this at a time when British                                                 221 Early History of the Strategical Section, by Col.

While this might have offered hope for a day bombardment group to support a new strategic campaign, the start of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive on 26 September meant the 1st Day Bombardment Group remained steadfastly tied to attacking German troop concentrations and lines of communication.  Still, the group did occasionally venture beyond the battlefront to attack more strategic targets like important rail junctions along the German-French border. The stand up of the 1st and the plans for a night-bomber force were not lost on the British, who saw it as a potential strategic unit that could cooperate with their Independent Force in the long discussed Allied strategic bombing campaign.  By October 1918, the situation at the front was starting to change dramatically.  With the Germans on the defensive and aircraft production finally catching up to predictions, American leadership showed a new openness to strategic bombing.223  There were differences between the allies that had to be worked out before a combined bomber offensive could be planned, but these seemed within reac
