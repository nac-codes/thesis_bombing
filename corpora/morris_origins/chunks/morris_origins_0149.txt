ip showed a new openness to strategic bombing.223  There were differences between the allies that had to be worked out before a combined bomber offensive could be planned, but these seemed within reach.  The most important was the issue of independence.  Earlier that summer, the AEF Air Service had completed a third proposal for a strategic bombing campaign during 1919.  General Pershing’s new Chief of Staff, Maj. Gen. James W. McAndrew, immediately placed limits on this effort.  In a memorandum dated 18 June 1918, he notified AEF Air Service Commander Patrick that while he approved of the planning for a future operation, he specifically precluded an independent air campaign or subordination under British                                                 223 Ibid., 367.

Meanwhile, the issue of targeting also caused conflict between the Allies.  The growing public pressure for revenge did not abate in England as the end of 1918 approached.  In many ways, the attitude took even more hold of the British government.  Air Minister Sir William Weir wrote to Trenchard in early November expressing that “I would very much like it if you could start a really big fire on one of the German towns.”225  It is likely this letter struck a chord with Tranchard as it meshed with his own understanding of the importance of the psychological effect of bombing.   This attitude caused consternation in the American command structure.  They feared the British would inflict carnage on German cities in the name of revenge or destroying morale.
