d consternation in the American command structure.  They feared the British would inflict carnage on German cities in the name of revenge or destroying morale.  Concern appeared at the highest levels of the U.S. government.  In October 1918, Secretary of War Newton Baker sent word to General Pershing that the U.S. would not participate in any bombing plan that had as its objective “promiscuous bombing upon industry, commerce, or population.”226   In many ways these two issues forecast later debates on strategic bombing strategy.  Yet, in the end, World War I was over before any substantive actions could be taken to ameliorate the differences between the British and Americans.

What was the best way to accomplish a strategic bombing campaign?  What type of force was necessary to win a war through the air?  These questions were all left open to interpretation by the end of fighting on 11 November 1918.    Technological Shortcomings and Conflicting Leadership   Perhaps a more useful question at this stage is why did the Americans fail to accept strategic bombing on the same level as their British allies?  While some of the reasons have been discussed in the preceding text, two other important areas deserve further study.  In their own particular way both technology and leadership also doomed any American strategic bombing campaign. Technological limitations proved a constant thorn in the side of American strategic bombing advocates.  The key problem was the inability of America’s aviation industry to produce large numbers of aircraft.  From t
