limitations proved a constant thorn in the side of American strategic bombing advocates.  The key problem was the inability of America’s aviation industry to produce large numbers of aircraft.  From the beginning, the U.S. government and the Army in particular maintained policies adverse to the growth of a functional aviation industry.  This dated back to the Army’s initial position that all airframes had to be developed by the producer with no monetary support from the government.227  This effectively limited new developers as few had the funds on hand to produce aircraft without outside support.  The Army’s continual unwillingness to buy the large numbers of aircraft required to spur the growth of an aviation industry exacerbated this initial decision.  Even if an aircraft developer invested its own funds, there was little chance of making significant profits of the sale of large numbers of airplanes to the military.

As the United States entered World War I, the government finally addressed the issue of aviation funding.  In July 1917, Congress appropriated $640 million for military aviation.  Along with this funding came the promise from industry experts that with the money the Army could field 4,500 aircraft by May 1918.228  Unfortunately, despite the promises of industrial representatives, congressional leaders, and the press, the American aircraft industry was only just beginning to make good on its promised aircraft deliveries when the war ended. This was especially true for bombardment aircraft.  On 29 May 1917, the Joint Army-Navy Technical Board all but ensured a shortage of bomber aircraft when i
