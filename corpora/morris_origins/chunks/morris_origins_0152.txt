sed aircraft deliveries when the war ended. This was especially true for bombardment aircraft.  On 29 May 1917, the Joint Army-Navy Technical Board all but ensured a shortage of bomber aircraft when it determined a production ratio of 3:5:1 for pursuit, observation, and bomber aircraft.229  When the American aviation industry fell behind schedule on aircraft deliveries, the manufacturers focused on the higher-priority pursuit and observation aircraft.  Consequently, when Gorrell first took command of Strategical Aviation in the Zone of Advance, he had a plan for action, but only a handful of aircraft to carry it out. The statistics demonstrate the dire state of bomber production Gorrell faced.  The first American-built DH-4 daylight bomber was not shipped from Hoboken, New Jersey until March 1918.  By that time, Gorrell had already been relieved of his command and strategic bombing was fast fading from the AEF leadership’s attention.  In the end, only                                                 228 Maurer, U.S. Air Service in World War I, 105. 229 Report of the Joint Army-Navy Technical Aircraft Board, 29 May 1917, Sec A11, in Gorrell History, 11-12.

With their new push to produce a large bomber force, British industry had to retool to provide larger engines for the new aircraft.  Unfortunately, the process often resulted in delays.  A good example is the production of the Beardmore-Helford-Pulling engine for the DH-4 daylight bomber.  In the fall of 1917, a problem with the engine’s aluminum cylinders caused a six-month production delay, which was not completely resolved until April 1918.231  Luckily, supplies of French Hispano-Suiza engines helped ameliorate the problem, but the delays in Br
