nders caused a six-month production delay, which was not completely resolved until April 1918.231  Luckily, supplies of French Hispano-Suiza engines helped ameliorate the problem, but the delays in British DH-4 production meant American units did not receive their quotas of British-built aircraft until after Gorrell’s plans had become overtaken by events on the ground. A second factor disrupting bomber plans was conflicting leadership visions.  Both at the AEF and the Air Service level, Gorrell had to contend with confusing and often inconsistent guidance.  This surely was the case in December 1917 when Gorrell represented the Americans at Trenchard’s inter-allied bombing conference.  Having just received Pershing’s approval for his bombing proposal and a promotion to command the Air Service’s strategic bombing forces, Gorrell must have expected Pershing to support the combined strategic bombing effort fully. Yet, Trenchard’s then deputy Brig. Gen. Gerald Blaine points out this was not the case.  Shortly after the bombing conference, Trenchard called on Pershing to discuss the proposal to allow the AEF bombers to work with the British forces.  In a memorandum                                                 230 Chief of the Air Service Annual Report, 1919, U.S. Air Force Academy Library, Colorado Springs, CO, 225. 231 Jones, Official History, Vol. VI, 38.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 147 --- 141 dated 13 January 1918, Blaine described Pershing’s response.  He wrote, “I could see clearly and in fact he said no, that he was not at all desirous of putting American personnel under us.”232  This was an interesting turnaround, considering that Pershing had approved Gorrell’s November 1917 bombing proposal, which was similar to the one Trenchard advocated. It is likely two elements intervened to change Pershing’s thinking.  The first was the issue of independence.  Pershing’s staff warned that the Air Service’s emphasis on conducting independent campaigns could hu
