y two elements intervened to change Pershing’s thinking.  The first was the issue of independence.  Pershing’s staff warned that the Air Service’s emphasis on conducting independent campaigns could hurt ground operations.  The AEF Chief of Staff McAndrew’s warning to Patrick that “it is therefore directed that these officers be warned against any idea of independence,” demonstrates the pervasiveness of the concern in the general staff.233  The second issue on Pershing’s mind was likely the realization that American ground forces were soon to enter combat.  Given the delays in aircraft production, Pershing must have been concerned over the Air Service’s ability to support the ground offensive and a strategic campaign at the same time.  He even alluded to this in his memoirs when he referred to the double failure of the United States to produce aircraft and to send raw materials to allies, resulting in only nine of the planned sixty squadrons being combat ready in February 1918.234  In this light, Trenchard’s proposal must have sounded like sapping U.S. air power strength when it was needed most. Historian Robert White suggests a potential third explanation for this strategic about-face.  He contends that Pershing was caught off guard by Trenchard’s request due                                                 232 HQ RFC Memorandum, 13 January 1918, AIR 1/925/204/5/812, London: NAUK. 233 Memo, MacAndrew to Patrick, 18 June 1918, in Gorrell History, Sec B-6, 42. 234 John J.

Simply put, Foulois never notified his boss that Trenchard planned to ask him to provide U.S. bombers to the British effort.  White demonstrates that Foulois knew of Trenchard’s proposal for two weeks before the Pershing-Trenchard meeting, but failed to brief his commander on the plan.235  Given this information, it is possib
