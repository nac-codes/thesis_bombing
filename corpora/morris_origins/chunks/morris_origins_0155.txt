hite demonstrates that Foulois knew of Trenchard’s proposal for two weeks before the Pershing-Trenchard meeting, but failed to brief his commander on the plan.235  Given this information, it is possible Pershing simply reacted to being caught off guard by reverting to his staff’s more conservative vision of American air power. Either way, Pershing and Trenchard resolved the issue through a series of letters.  On 6 February 1918, Pershing wrote to Trenchard to announce he would cooperate with his plan, if not fully place American forces under British command.  Pershing ended the letter by promising “you may be sure that I shall do everything in my power to make this cooperation as effective as possible.”236  Given the back-and-forth nature of Pershing’s support for strategic bombing, it is understandable how Gorrell was caught in the middle.  This helps explain why he worked so feverishly to modify his proposal in January 1918, when he perhaps should have been more focused on starting bombing missions. A similar leadership issue existed at the Air Service level.  Rapid growth created a unique problem for the Air Service command staff, which lacked a robust pool of trained and experienced officers to man the critical planning functions.  What few experienced personnel were available often rapidly left staff positions to take command of important field operations.  While this was good for the overall Air Service, it hurt important planning and strategy functions.  By early 1918, senior AEF commanders could see the confusion and careless staff work emanating from the Air Service.  Patrick alluded to it when informing his wife                                                 235 White, Mason Patrick, 29. 236 Pershing to Trenchard, 6 February 1918, AIR 1/925/204/5/812, NAUK.
