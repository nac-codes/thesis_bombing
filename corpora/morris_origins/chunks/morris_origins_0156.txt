He described Pershing’s words to him as, “the fact is I am entirely dissatisfied with the way the aviation service is getting on and I want you at the head of it and have you bring order out of what is now chaos.  There is bickering, they are running around in circles.  There is need for a man to take hold of it and whip it into shape.  I want you to do this for me.”237  Patrick’s words describe a problem that also dated back to the origins of the Air Service.  When House Resolution 5304 codified the long-standing Army policy of only allowing unmarried lieutenants under the age of thirty to join the service, it meant Pershing had to deal with a large number of young and inexperienced officers in his wartime air service.238  This youthful command structure often resulted in clashes of individual egos that more experienced officers would likely have been able to resolve.  A good example of this is the rivalry between Foulois and Mitchell.  If such a fight had broken out between two ground commanders, Pershing might have replaced them both with other experienced officers.  Yet, in the Air Service’s case, there simply were no other men with the pedigrees to replace either commander.  Pershing had no choice other than to bring in outsiders and had to keep a lid on the conflicts as best he could.  Given this staff environment, it is understandable how Gorrell had difficulty turning his vision for strategic bombing into reality.  Problems with production numbers were only exacerbated by staff confusion that limited the availability of the aircraft on hand.  Competing egos often drew attention from strategy discussions.  It is likely Gorrell never fully knew if he had staff support or not.  Given these issues, it is understandable                                                 237 Patrick to his wife, 11 May 1918, Mason Patrick Collection, Fort Rucker Archives, AL. 238 Ho
