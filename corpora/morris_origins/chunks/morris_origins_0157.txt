This was especially true of the Americans.  Lacking the political pressure to respond to German bombings of their homeland, American military leaders refocused their attention on ground combat.  This focus only intensified as the Army started taking a larger role in combat operations as 1918 progressed.    Gorrell represents the perfect example of American strategic bombing theory’s fate during the last year of the war.  As 1918 started, he rode a wave of British pressure, American openness, and great expectations to what seemed to be the threshold of a bombing campaign.  Unfortunately for him, reality did not quite meet his perceptions.  Even before the year began, signs of AEF staff animosity to Gorrell’s strategy became visible.

A lack of staff support during Gorrell’s short tenure as Commander of Strategical Aviation in the Zone of the Advance further limited bombing.  Finally, the resource requirements to support American ground forces in their growing combat roles spelled the end of any potential strategic campaigns in 1918.    Instead, a more balanced aerial strategy based on the traditional view of air power as a supporting element of ground forc
