is must have seemed like an unwieldy way to turn experience into doctrine.  Operational manuals were much smaller and easier to use in everyday training.  On the other hand, there was little chance of thousands of pages of reports being read by the average pilot or incorporated into the daily routine of a flying unit.  Yet, Patrick’s decision to put his aggressive chief of staff Edgar Gorrell in charge of the project helped ensure it had a long-lasting life.  While meeting Patrick’s directive, Gorrell went beyond just writing a history of what happened in the air.  Instead, he ensured that the theoretical debates, strategy arguments, and tactical decisions were also captured in the voluminous history.  More important for strategic bombing, he even wrote a history of the Strategical Section of the Zone of Advance and included a copy of the American bombing survey conducted at the end of the war.  These two steps ensured future generations had access not only to his ideas, but also a wealth of statistical data.  In this way, perhaps without truly knowing what he was doing, Gorrell effectively used an official history to shape future doctrinal debates.  When the next generation of aviators turned their attention to the possibilities of bombing, they had a ready-made handbook containing insights into strategic bombing’s origins and supporting data to help convince skeptics sitting in the libraries of such institutions as the Air Corps Tactical School and the general staff.                                                 239 National Archive’s Introduction, 1974, in Gorrell History, 2.

The operational manual was akin to the bible for most Army branches and field services.  It imparted the leadership-approved methodologies for solving various military problems.  In
