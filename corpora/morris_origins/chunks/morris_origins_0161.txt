young officers.  The operational manual was akin to the bible for most Army branches and field services.  It imparted the leadership-approved methodologies for solving various military problems.  In an era before formal doctrine documents, these manuals served a similar purpose.  They were literally the book in the old saying, “I want it done by the book.”  Considering this history, it is not unusual that Billy Mitchell, the American Air Service’s most famous airman, utilized this methodology to capture his vision of air power for future generations.  On 15 November 1918, Mitchell assumed command of the Air Services for the U.S. Third Army, which was the American contribution to the occupation forces monitoring German compliance with the Treaty of Versailles.240  This command represented a unique opportunity for Mitchell.
