As with his earlier operational plans drafted during the summer and fall of 1918, bombing remained mainly a direct ground support role.  The section left little room for debate when it specified that daylight bombers must be used in conjunction with supporting ground operations.  The section then pushed bombing further towards direct ground support when it stated, “all target selection should occur at the G-3 level to ensure targets match with the ground commander’s objectives.”242  Finally, the provisional manual extended the direct ground support theme to its discussion of tactics, inferring that any potential daylight bombing target would be close to the front lines and thus defended by Army units with machine guns and light antiaircraft artillery.  Accordingly, all tactical discussions revolved around the need to overcome threats associated with the forward edge of the battle area, while almost no dialogue related to issues associated with long-range flights like navigation or defense against enemy aircraft.  Night bombing, outlined in the second section of the document, also played a significant role for strategic bombing. Here Mitchell diverged from the late war use of nighttime missions targeting urban areas by suggesting the only future night role was harassing enemy troops.  In just one short paragraph, Mitchell dismissed night bombing as only potentially useful in avoiding aerial combat, while still disrupting enemy operations through harassment.243    This brings up an interesting issue.  Was this a sign that Mitchell’s did not support strategic bombing or was it simply his lack of knowledge resulting from Third Army’s                                                 242 Ibid., paragraph 68. 243 Ibid., paragraph 78.
