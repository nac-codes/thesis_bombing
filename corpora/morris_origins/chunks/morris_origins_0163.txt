It is clear that dating back to the April 1918 General Principles for American Aviation Bulletin, Mitchell advocated for air power as a semi-independent element directly tied to the ground war with little or no strategic mission.244  Still, this was a marked change from his earlier advocacy of long-range bombing in the early summer of 1917, when he stated that “with this class of aviation the United States may aid in the greatest way and which, it is believed if properly applied will have a greater influence on the ultimate decision of the war than any other one arm.”245  Whether Mitchell’s opinions truly evolved, or as some historians suggest he favored any policy that helped his personal situation remains open to debate.  What is known is that Mitchell’s 1919 manual effectively turned bombing into just another tool to use in defeating an enemy army.  While Mitchell’s provisional manual had limited value in stimulating strategic air power thought, it set a precedent for codifying and sharing new ideas.  When the AEF issued the manual as an Air Service Bulletin on 24 December 1918, it at once set the standard for turning operational experience into doctrine.246  Given the nature and origins of the document, it articulated the conventional Army vision of aviation as one element working in conjunction with others to achieve the defeat of the enemy’s army.  Despite Mitchell’s prominence, there was one important shortcoming in his approach that doomed its long-term influence.  The Army intended for its manuals to be superseded as new technology and operational theories proved themselves.
