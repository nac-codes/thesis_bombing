Accordingly, his manual could be considered one of the first doctrine documents in the U.S. Air Service.  Sherman’s manual even included a detailed discussion of strategic bombing.  He expanded on Mitchell’s direct ground support role to include “the destruction of the                                                 247 Ibid., 313.

Even with its popularity and acceptance, Sherman’s manual had the same institutional flaw as Mitchell’s.  As with other manuals, it required regular updates.

By the time a new generation of aviators sought their guidance, these manuals were no longer within easy reach.  Luckily for strategic bombing theory, there was another type of document produced after the war that captured more ideas in a format that would ensure its availability to future theorist.  The Official History    As the war’s end neared, Gorrell once again returned to the Air Service command staff after his tour with the AEF G3 section.  On 28 October 1918, at the age of twenty-seven, Gorrell became the youngest colonel in the Army when Patrick selected him as his new chief of staff.  The position fit Gorrell’s strengths perfectly.  Since his arrival in France in June 1917, Gorrell had excelled at administrative staff work.  As a member of the Bolling Commission, he had authored detailed descriptions of European aviation technology and had crafted well-rea
