also offered the chance to inculcate his own priorities into the official history.  Gorrell envisioned his study as a book that each Air Service officer would own and refer to while developing his thoughts on air power doctrine.253  Therefore, he took a special interest in the history beyond that ordered by Patrick.  Gorrell personally wrote several sections of the final product, including two that were critical for the how future generations theorized about strategic bombing.  The first of these was the history of the American Liaison Officer in Paris.  This history recounted the Bolling Commission’s travels, the early theoretical debates, and the interactions with the French and British aviation missions.  Gorrell was perfectly situated                                                 251 Ibid., 2. 252 Skelton, “Colonel Gorrell’s Records,” 60. 253 Ibid., 61.

He even included several of his personal conversations with the British and French concerning the evolving thoughts on strategic bombardment that would have otherwise been lost.   Gorrell depicted strong ties between these first American aviators in Europe and their French and British contemporaries.  This is not surprising, as the young Americans often looked to the more experienced Europeans for help interpreting the evolving air war.  What is more surprising, though, is Gorrell’s downplaying of the Italian influences on the Americans.

Another possibility is Gorrell believed that Capt. Fiorello La Guar
