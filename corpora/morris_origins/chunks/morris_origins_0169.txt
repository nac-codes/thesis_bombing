ook better by not bringing to light his early failed attempts to convince Air Service leadership to buy large numbers of Caproni’s.  Another possibility is Gorrell believed that Capt. Fiorello La Guardia, who was the Joint Army-Navy Aircraft Committee in Paris liaison to Italian authorities, would cover the issue in his submission.  Finally, it is also possible this was a simple reflection of the general trend of the Americans moving ever closer to their British and French allies as they started to enter combat operations.  The record remains muddy on the issue, but the failure to credit Caproni could help explain why many historians overlook the Italian influence on early U.S. air power theory and technology.  Despite these problems, the Paris office history was still important because it preserved most of Gorrell’s theoretical influences and documented the early debates and decisions concerning strategic bombing in the fledgling AEF Air Service.                                                 254 J.

While a large portion of the section describes Gorrell’s actions as Commander of Strategical Aviation in the Zone of Advance, his inclusion of his 28 November 1917 bombing campaign proposal likely had a longer lasting effect.  Without its inclusions, Gorrell’s strategy may have become just another staff proposal lost to history.  Instead, it maintained a prominent place in one of the few sections of the official history that discussed long-range or strategic bombing, and it was readily accessible and easy to find for future researchers. Gorrell did not stop with just including his Nove
