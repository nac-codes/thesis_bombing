ections of the official history that discussed long-range or strategic bombing, and it was readily accessible and easy to find for future researchers. Gorrell did not stop with just including his November proposal.  He also highlighted the reasons why he believed strategic bombing failed to garner senior AEF leadership support.  Gorrell placed the majority of blame at his own feet when he wrote that “the Air Service failed to secure the approval of the General Staff and consequently suffered from the fact that its plans for the use of the Strategical Air Service were not synchronized properly, especially from the mental point of view of its employment, with the ideas of the G.H.Q.”255 He even admitted that this failure was due to inexperience.  Thus, he acknowledged his inexperience as a staff officer convinced him that gaining Pershing’s approval was enough to assure the cooperation of the senior members of the AEF staff.  This was a serious mistake by a young staff officer. In this way, once again the issue of inexperience in the Air Service’s officer corps portended problems.  As a result of prior Army rules limiting entry to only lieutenants less than thirty years of age, many Air Service officers were quite young and                                                 255 Early History of the Strategical Section, by Col.

Gorrell was a perfect example, as he was only twenty-six years old when he took over the Strategical section.  He had limited general staff experience, had not attended the Staff College, and had little experience working with senior officers.  Could a more seasoned officer have coordinated better and brought strategic bombing to fruition?  Given the reticence of many senior Army officers, it is doubtful.  Still, Gorrell’s inexperience did not serve him well in this staff battle.
