dinated better and brought strategic bombing to fruition?  Given the reticence of many senior Army officers, it is doubtful.  Still, Gorrell’s inexperience did not serve him well in this staff battle.      Besides poor coordination, Gorrell also saw technological problems as an explanation for strategic bombing’s failure to gain traction in the U.S. Army during the war.  He succinctly spelled out the problem when he wrote that “entirely too much optimism was felt for the American Production Program,” which resulted in the AEF Air Service bomber aircraft shortage.  Gorrell was less forgiving on this fault, indicating “it was only the cold matter of fact experience which proved to the world that money and men could not make an air program over night and that the time to prepare for war was not after war had been declared.”256  In modern parlance, Gorrell might have said that if promises sound too good to be true, they likely are.  As such, he not only castigated the Army and Air Service for believing the rosy aircraft production predictions, but also highlighted the need for industrial planning before hostilities broke out. In addition to these two sections, one other section encompassed valuable insights for future strategic bombing theorists.  While writing their histories, many officers included their own critiques and recommendations along with their documentation.  Gorrell decided to include the best of these in a separate section titled Lessons and Recommendations.   While these generally focused on tactical or logistical issues, the volume also contained several references to bombing.                                                 256 Ibid., 401.

At the end of the war, Patrick ordered that no one could depart for America until they “furnished in writing to Colonel Gorrell any information of value which he possess and which he has acquired while in the
