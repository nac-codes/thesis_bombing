nd of the war, Patrick ordered that no one could depart for America until they “furnished in writing to Colonel Gorrell any information of value which he possess and which he has acquired while in the American Air Service.”257  As a result, a flood of submissions came in from the field.  Many were quickly written memorandums of little value designed to get the author released for return stateside as soon as possible.  Others, though, were well-developed and thoughtful examinations of individual experiences during the war and how they might apply to the future of military aviation.  Three examples deserve special attention for their relevancy to future strategic bombing theorists. The first was the submission of Col. Thomas DeWitt Milling, the Chief of the Air Service for the U.S. First Army.  Milling had a distinguished career in the AEF Air Service, serving as the chief of Air Service Training in Europe before replacing Billy Mitchell at 1st Army.258  Milling’s greatest contribution was his discussion of bombing tactics and technological issues.
