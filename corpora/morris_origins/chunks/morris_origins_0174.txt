In his classic study of World War I technological innovation The War of Invention: Science in the Great War: 1914-1918, Historian Guy Hartcup described how both the British and French developed government-run networks of education and scientific institutions working to develop new                                                 260 Ibid., 6. 261 Ibid.

Coming late to the war and lacking experience with a military-industrial system, the Americans had their hands full just trying to build the needed aircraft.  Making technological changes on an industrial scale was simply beyond their ability in 1918.  Fittingly, Milling’s specific example of DH-4 fuel tanks echoed Gorrell’s call to build an industrial system capable of supporting military operations during peacetime, not when war demanded immediate action. The contribution of Maj. George E. A. Reinburg, Commander of the 2nd Day Bombardment Group, straddled the fence between strategy and technology.  On the strategy side, he paralleled Gorrell’s earlier vision when he wrote: “observation and bombing are the principal roles of the Air Service, while pursuit is to protect those roles.”262  Like Gorrell, he challenged the fundamental understanding of why an air force existed.  When America entered the war, the prioritization of observation and air superiority had led to a production ratio of 3:5:1 for pursuit to observation to bomber aircraft.  Reinburg challenged this ratio, arguing that bombing was a core mission of the Air Service and as such should be reprioritized at least on a par with observation.   While important, Reinburg’s strategy discussion paled when compared to the importance of his technology recommendations.  He started by explaining that expected results for bombing, especially in the press and public, were unreasonable given the then state of aviation technology.263  Hence, the Ai
