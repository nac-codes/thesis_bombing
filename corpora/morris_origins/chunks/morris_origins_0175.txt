ology recommendations.  He started by explaining that expected results for bombing, especially in the press and public, were unreasonable given the then state of aviation technology.263  Hence, the Air Service needed to develop a plan that addressed the issue from both ends.  It was not enough just to develop new technologies                                                 262 Second Bomb Group Lessons from the War in the Air, 18 December 1918, Sec A-15, in Gorrell History, 209. 263 Ibid., 211.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 167 --- 161 to increase accuracy and destructive force, the military also needed to work with the public to educate and excite them about realistic air power capabilities.   At the same time, Reinburg also identified a major gap in the relationship between intelligence and air operations.  He first lauded the AEF G-2’s integration with the British and French intelligence’s industrial analysis and targeting system, but then called for even more integration with air missions.  Reinburg advocated for an intelligence office under the Air Service’s command to conduct immediate assessment of operational results in order to fold them back into the campaign plan before the next mission.264  In doing so, he believed the intelligence analysts could reduce redundancy and bring more pressure to bear on the enemy’s industrial system in a shorter amount of time.   The final input of note was that of Capt. N. W. Owens, the Air Service Adjutant and prior Night Bombardment staff officer.  Owens’ contribution served less as a recommendation than as ammunition for future air strategists concerning the industrial problem of building a large bombing force.  While most viewed the Liberty engine as a triumph of  the American industrial effort, Owens cautioned that this was not always the case.  He described how problems with the engines in the Handley Page bomber program demonstrated that there were still significant failures even in this highly touted success
