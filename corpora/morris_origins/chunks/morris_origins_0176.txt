this was not always the case.  He described how problems with the engines in the Handley Page bomber program demonstrated that there were still significant failures even in this highly touted success story.  The original plan called for the delivery of 50 Liberty engines to the Handley Page factory in May 1918, 100 in June, and 160 by the end of July.  After that, 40 engines per week were to arrive at the factory.  Reality was quite different from the plan, though, with only 10 incomplete engines arriving through the end of August.  By October 1918, the factory had to request the shipment of only parts, as most engines arrived missing                                                 264 Ibid., 212.

In this way, the official history contained a wealth of information for those seeking background information on bombing in World War I.  Gorrell’s own two sections provided the context of his proposals and demonstrated the theories behind strategic bombing.  Milling, Reinburg, and Owens added to the information with their descriptions of strategic and technical, and production problems faced during the actual bombing campaigns.  From their works, future bombing advocates could garner an understanding that building and supporting a bombing force was just as critical as using it in combat.  Finally, tactical hints by Milling and Reinburg provided guidance for future theorists in determining how to use bombers in combat.  The World War I Bombing Survey The only major item missing in Gorrell’s history was what actually happened during the bombing campaigns of World War I.  The unit histories and individual recommendations seldom discussed the actual missions, their results, or how they affected the larger war.
