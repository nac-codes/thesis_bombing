lly happened during the bombing campaigns of World War I.  The unit histories and individual recommendations seldom discussed the actual missions, their results, or how they affected the larger war.  This omission must have also struck Gorrell, as he convinced Patrick of the need for such a study of the effects of bombing in the European war.  This resulted in the analysis officially titled Results of Air Service Efforts as Determined by Investigation of Damage Done in Occupied Territories, commonly referred to as the World War I Bombing Survey.  Gorrell then made sure to include the report as a companion to the official history so its data would not be lost.                                                 265 Memorandum to Air Service Chief of Staff, 18 January 1918, Sec A-15, in Gorrell history, 122.

The Section quickly realized this was beyond its capability and sent a formal request for such a study to the AEF G-2 section, which approved it on 19 February and tasked the First Army G-2 to accomplish the mission.  From 1 March to 20 May, teams of 1st Army intelligence officers examined bombing sites in an area bounded by the Rhine River and the line running through Dusseldorf, Duren, and Meziers.266  This area covered all U.S. strategical bombing missions, while also encompassing most RAF Independent Force and some French strategic targets.  The 1st Army G-2 did consider expanding the area to include more targets, but difficulties with gaining access to cities east of the Rhine frustrated their efforts. A remarkable analysis for its time, the survey investigated 140 cities based on planned bombing missions by the western Allies.  The survey combined three methodologies to garner information: physical observation; records reviews; and interviews.  It even incl
