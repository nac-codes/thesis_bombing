140 cities based on planned bombing missions by the western Allies.  The survey combined three methodologies to garner information: physical observation; records reviews; and interviews.  It even included attempts to corroborate interview data with city records and diary accounts.  In the end, this high level of information requirements limited the pool of cities the survey could report on to only eighty.  The authors of the survey indicated that it was impossible to obtain data from the other sixty cities as a combination of record destruction or shipments of records to Germany before the allied arrival limited their ability to garner accurate information in those areas. 267 The report had four sections.  Section one contained a general narrative on the effects of Allied bombing.  In what today would be called an executive summary, the                                                 266 Results of the Air Service Efforts as Determined by Investigation of Damage Done in Occupied Territories, Vol 1: General Effects of Allied Bombing, 1919, Sec R-1, in Gorrell history, 1. 267 Ibid., 1.

Finally, sections three and four of the survey provided supporting data in the form of maps and photographs respectively. The general narrative was the most widely read portion of the survey.  Its primary importance was in providing monetary estimates of the damage done by Allied bombing.  The survey started by identifying an estimated 35 million marks in physical damage to German cities and industry.  While this number may seem high for the limited number of missions and the rudimentary bombing t
