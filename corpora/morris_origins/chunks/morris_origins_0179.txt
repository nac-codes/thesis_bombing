started by identifying an estimated 35 million marks in physical damage to German cities and industry.  While this number may seem high for the limited number of missions and the rudimentary bombing technologies utilized, it was an accurate calculation of the damage observed by American investigators or garnered through German reports of damage.  Yet, when translated into today’s GDP U.S. dollar value, it is only $324 million dollars.268  Considering the Federal Emergency Management Agency estimated that Hurricane Katrina caused more than $80 billion in physical damage in 2005, this estimate seems appropriate for the limited long-range bombing campaigns conducted during World War I. The general narrative then attempted to expand beyond the physical destruction to estimate the cost of the less tangible effects of bombing.  First, it calculated the expense of lost production to the enemy’s economy.  The investigators found twenty-two cities that kept records of lost industrial hours due to bombing.  From these records, they estimated that the Germans lost more than 71 million marks due to factory disruptions,                                                 268 All translations of 1918 Marks into 2014 U.S. dollars accomplished through Measuring Worth, 2014 URL:http://measuringworth.com/exchangeglobal/.

The authors must have understood that this number seemed high, as they included a large amount of supporting data to buttress their assertions.  The section relied heavily on official reports and interviews for objective data.  For instance, the authors quoted the manager of the Burbach-Esch-Dudelange Iron Works in Easch as stating; “it took about 30 minutes after a raid or alert before all personnel were back at work.”270  Based on interviews like this, the survey calculat
