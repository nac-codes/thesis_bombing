e Burbach-Esch-Dudelange Iron Works in Easch as stating; “it took about 30 minutes after a raid or alert before all personnel were back at work.”270  Based on interviews like this, the survey calculated the loss of seventy minutes per raid or alert, as the workers went to shelters, waiting out the bombing, then returned to their workstations.  At the same time the authors reminded the reader that a single raid might trigger multiple alerts as the bombers penetrated enemy airspace and threatened several cities before their intended targets became clear.  Therefore, a single raid might result in production loses many times higher than the actual physical destruction accomplished by the bombs.   Next, the survey examined the morale effects of bombing.  Through a series of interviews the investigators attempted to determine how bombing created such confusion and fear that it might paralyze a population.  While this portion of the general narrative was the least scientific, it made a strong argument that bombing instilled fear in the local population that disrupted their daily lives and work habits.  Again, the authors included specific examples to extrapolate economic costs from their subjective analysis.  Items like official records reporting three people dying of fright after a raid on Ehrange on 23 August 1918 seemed to corroborate that bombing had a chilling effect on civilian                                                 269 Results of Bombing, Gorrell History, R-1, 3. 270 Ibid., 3.

Meanwhile, a railroad official in Thionville claimed that he had to increase the numbers of workmen after raids because his workers were too shaken up to accomplish tasks without extra help supported conclusions about the loss of production from fear.  Finally, even military reports often supported a morale cost to bombing.  One report cited in this section demonstrated that the German military closed its troop rest faci
