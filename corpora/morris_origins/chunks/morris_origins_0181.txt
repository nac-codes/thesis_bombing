ss of production from fear.  Finally, even military reports often supported a morale cost to bombing.  One report cited in this section demonstrated that the German military closed its troop rest facility at Bouley because the frequent bombings kept soldiers from getting enough sleep.271  Based on these factors, the report ended with a final estimate of the cost of bombing to the German economy.  While it included the 641 killed and 1,263 wounded in bombing attacks, the survey stressed that the real results of bombing were economic.  The study estimated bombing cost the German war effort 204 million marks.  This included an estimated 133 million in direct cost from physical damage and loss of production and another 71 million in indirect cost from civil defenses, morale loss, and air defense.272  To put that in today’s U.S. GDP dollar value, it equaled approximately $15 billion in economic damage.  At the same time, the survey was quick to point out that this cost was only based on 66 out of 140 cities targeted in the study area where they could find verifiable data.273  This suggested that if the trends found in these 66 cities held true for the others bombed by French, English, and American aircraft, the real cost of bombing could have been three to four times higher.   Because this tantalizing possibility must have seemed far-fetched to many Army leaders., the report’s authors were ready to preempt any criticism based solely on                                                 271 Ibid., 4-5. 272 Ibid., 6. 273 While the report included data on 80 cities, only 66 were deemed verifiable enough to include in damage calculations.

Still, the survey pointed out that even if the numbers were overestimated, these results occurred without a dedicated campaign specifically targeting critical military-related in
