just that, estimates. Still, the survey pointed out that even if the numbers were overestimated, these results occurred without a dedicated campaign specifically targeting critical military-related industries.  Thus, the survey invited future readers to speculate on what might have been accomplished if the Air Service had focused on strategic bombing and not on ground support. After the monetary discussion, the report continued with a section on recommendations for future bombing operations.  It started by acknowledging the primacy of air power in supporting ground forces, but then quickly hinted that a new role for air forces was needed.  An example of this occurred on page eight where the survey stated there could be no separate or independent bombing force, but then quickly went on to attack this deeply held Army belief in a discussion of target selection.  It recommended reversing the long-standing priority of first enemy troops, next railroad facilities, and only then industrial targets.  The survey explained there was more value in targeting industry than troop concentrations or transportation systems, as destroying the ability make weapons was more valuable than disrupting their arrival or usage at the front.   Therefore, they should be the first priority for future air forces.274  The final summary went even further to spell out specific recommendations that previewed the future theoretical debates of the 1930s.  On targeting, the report once again diverged from the British with regards to urban bombing.  The Americans refuted the British use of city bombing to break the enemy’s morale, explaining that “bombing for morale effects alone such as took place over Cologne, Frankfurt, Bonn, and Wiesbaden is not a productive means of bombing.  The effect is legitimate and just as considerable                                                 274 Ibid., 8.
