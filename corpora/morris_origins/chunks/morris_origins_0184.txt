Gorrell also spent a tremendous effort in capturing as much of the historical lessons and critiques of the Air Service’s experience in World War I as possible in his postwar official history.  Finally, Gorrell’s experience and capabilities led to his selection to work for President Woodrow Wilson during the Paris Peace Conference. Wilson arrived in Europe on 13 December 1918 to prepare for the peace negotiations.  Once he arrived in Paris, the president gathered a team of advisors to help prepare the American positions on the many different aspects of the proposed treaty.  One of these elements concerned the future of international aviation and flying in Germany,  to be addressed by a subcommission titled the Aeronautical Commission of the Peace Conference.  When Wilson inquired about a qualified young officer to advise him on the subcommission’s activities, General Patrick proffered Gorrell.  Thus, Wilson likely started Gorrell along his future path as an expert in civil aviation when he selected him as his advisor on international aviation concerns during the Paris Peace Conference.276   The Aeronautical Commission did not start its formal work until March 1919 when it set about creating a set of rules for international aviation.  The commission worked through a series of conventions where representatives from twenty-seven nations gathered to reach agreements.  Their work concluded with the Convention Relating to the Regulation of Aerial Navigation on 13 October 1919.  In the treaty, all twenty-seven nations agreed to adhere to international flight standards and methodologies to coordinate aviation issues that crossed international borders.277  This commission eventually came                                                 276 Edgar S.
