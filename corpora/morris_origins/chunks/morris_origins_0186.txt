On 19 April 1919, General Pershing convened the Dickman Board in Paris to review the performance of each branch of the AEF and make suggestions for improving tactics and organization. Patrick tasked Benjamin Foulois to draft the Air Service’s response, which was fairly conservative and mirrored much of Mitchell’s previous recommendations.  One of the important differences came in the area of bombing.  Foulois emphasized that the primary mission of an Air Service was the collection and                                                 278 Mason Patrick.

Foulois almost completely dismissed bombing when he labeled bombing of distant targets a luxury.279    Interestingly, this is one of only two areas where Patrick felt the need to disagree with Foulois in writing.  He attached his own dissent, explaining that “once it is possible to place a bombing force in the field, its size should be limited only by the nation’s ability to provide it and by the numbers and importance of the enemy activities which are to be attacked.”280  While not an endorsement of strategic bombing, Patrick’s response represented an openness to the concept that would continue until his return to command of the U.S. Air Service in the 1920s.   The conclusion of the Dickman Board coincided with the arrival of Assistant Secretary of War Benedict Crowell in May 1919.  Secretary of War Newton D. Baker appointed Crowell to lead the American Aviation Mission with orders to tour Italy, France, and Britain to observe and report on the status of their aeronautical developments.  Baker even included a direct order to Crowell to “limit himself to fact-finding and submit no conclusions as to
