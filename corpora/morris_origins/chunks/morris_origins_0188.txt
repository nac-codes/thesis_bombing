e need pay no attention to me.”282 While not changing the direction of the Air Service, the differences between Patrick and Crowell reflected the changing attitudes towards aviation starting to drive theoretical debates stateside.  With the war over, political and economic pressures once again became part of the doctrinal and organizational debates.  It was no longer a discussion solely over what air power’s mission should be, but also how the mission met the political agendas and economic policies in the quickly changing domestic and international situation.  Much like the arguments about air power and governmental policies of the early 1900s, the postwar vision of air power was going to be once again seen through the prism of political and economic priorities.   With this change of attitude starting to make its presence felt, Patrick and Gorrell boarded the passenger liner Aquitania for the return trip to the United States on 13 July                                                 282 Patrick Diary, 21 Jun 1919, Mason M.

Crowell’s team also travelled home on the Aquitania, but both Patrick and Gorrell indicated that no one in Crowell’s party paid any attention to them on the trip.  Instead, Gorrell agreed to function as Patrick’s aide, and the two men built a life-long friendship as they discussed the potential for air power in future wars and the long road ahead for military aviation.283  Thus, this return trip was a good model for the forces brewing that would influence aviation in the early 1920s, pitting political goals, economic realities, personality conflicts, and military desires against each other in a drawn-out debate over the role of military aviation that would drown out the question of strategic bombing. Gorrell arrived in Washington in July 1919 and was immediately assigned to the Operations Sec
