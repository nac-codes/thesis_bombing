rawn-out debate over the role of military aviation that would drown out the question of strategic bombing. Gorrell arrived in Washington in July 1919 and was immediately assigned to the Operations Section of the General Staff.  His primary duty on the staff was to represent the Air Service during the Frear congressional investigation into U.S. aviation performance during World War I.  Headed by the Wisconsin Republican representative James A. Frear, the committee conducted a long series of interviews with military officers, industrial leaders, and aviation critics before submitting a report highly critical of the Air Service.  The committee castigated the Air Service for procurement, training, and operational deficiencies, especially during the build-up of forces in late 1917.  Gorrell, on the other hand, helped write the minority opinion for the committee, arguing that aviation performed better than should be expected.  He maintained that despite the sizeable budget allocations, there had been no foundation for building a large aviation industry, training thousands of pilots, and conducting massive aerial campaigns in such a short time.284  Instead, under those circumstances he argued that Congress should praise the Air Service for achieving what it did.                                                 283 Gorrell Biography, Anderson papers, Maxwell AFB, AL. 284 Ibid.

Desiring a new challenge, he resigned from the military in March 1920 to pursue a career in the auto industry, eventually rising to the presidency of the Stutz Motor Company.285  Still, Gorrell could never truly leave aviation behind.  After a long furlough, he once again returned to aviation in the 1930s, just in time to influence a new generation of air power theorists.  Conclusion  Gorrellâ€™s history was exactly what was needed at that particular moment
