Conclusion  Gorrell’s history was exactly what was needed at that particular moment for strategic bombing.  The breadth and depth of his study meant it remained a powerful reference work for American aviation for decades to follow.  While it drifted into obscurity during the 1920s, as the political debates about air power and more exciting aerial figures grabbed the nation’s attention, the history was rediscovered in the 1930s.   As students at professional schools like the Air Corps Tactical School began to search the history to help them form their own ideas on air power, Gorrell’s vision of bombing once again found a theoretical and intellectual home.   In this way, Gorrell created a document that unlike the manuals of Mitchell or Sherman survived the test of time to reach the next generation of aviation thinkers.  It contained not only the historical documentation of what actually happened, but also gave readers a firm understanding of the theories that underlined Gorrell’s, Tiverton’s, and Grey’s vision of long-range bombing of German industrial targets.
