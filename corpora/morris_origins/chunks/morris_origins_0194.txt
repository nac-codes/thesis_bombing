or participant in the international system, the United States returned to its more traditionally isolationist posture.  With this return to an internally focused political policy, there was no longer a need to maintain the large and extremely costly wartime military.   Military demobilization followed swiftly behind the political changes with lower budgets, less equipment, and manpower shortages defining the future.  The massive reductions hit the Air Service hard.  Of the twenty thousand officers on duty at the end of the war, only a little more than two hundred regular officers remained in the Air Service at the start of 1920.  To make matters worse, these were all officers “on detail” from other branches as the Air Service was still not a formally recognized corps within the Army, but just a subdivision of the Signal Corps.287 Besides the understandable problems with the loss of budgets and manpower resources, the Air Service faced other less obvious effects.  A good example occurred in personnel policies.  With demobilization came the return of prewar permanent ranks for many Air Service leaders.  Here again, the 1909 personnel policy of only allowing junior officers to become pilots disrupted the service.  Whereas, most senior infantry or artillery officers returned to postwar duties at similar ranks to their wartime ratings, Air Service officers often saw a jaw-dropping demotion.
