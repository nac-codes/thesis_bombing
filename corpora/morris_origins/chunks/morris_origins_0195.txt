ois best described the effect of this policy when he explained the sheer shock of leaving the troopship a brigadier general and becoming a captain the minute he walked onto the dock.288   Besides the psychological challenge of switching from flag officer to company-grade rank in a matter of minutes, there were also important structural ramifications for the Air Service.  While some officers like Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell maintained their current rank due to statutory assignments, the vast majority reverted to their prewar ranks.  The combination of allowing entry only to very junior officers and then having limited promotion opportunities meant few of these men had advanced past the rank of first lieutenant before the United States joined the war.  Thus, the Air Service of the early 1920s faced a serious shortage of field-grade officers.  Unfortunately, the rank gap limited the Armyâ€™s ability to select qualified Air Service squadron commanders, as they had a large pool of combat experienced officers, but none at the field-grade rank.  This left the Army two options.  They could allow junior officers to fill command positions that called for more senior rank, or they could transfer non-flying officers of the proper rank to command flying squadrons.  As might be expected, neither option excited Air Service leaders.  These personnel issues highlight a larger problem for the Air Service in the 1920s.  While external forces shaped the overall context that the Air Service evolved within, there were also changes internal to the Army that influenced doctrine away from strategic bombing.  First, demobilization and lower budgets convinced most Army leaders of the need to reassert control over their often-rebellious junior branch.
