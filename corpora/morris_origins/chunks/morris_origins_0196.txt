Finally, the restructuring and demobilization of the Army created difficult problems for the Air Service’s leaders in personnel, supply, and training that diverted their attention from theoretical debates on how to use air power in war. The most important of these internal pressures was the return of tight Army control.  While the final year of the war taught senior Army leaders the value of air power, many of them balked at talk of a war-winning role for air power or the concept of an independent air force.  They preferred to find a way to alleviate aviation’s budgetary, personnel, and command concerns while hewing tightly to the traditional ground-centric view of warfare.  Part of this change in thinking attacked the concept of an independent role for air power based on the mission of strategic bombing.  Despite some congressional support for the model of the British Royal Air Force, the Army strongly opposed any autonomy for the Air Service based on a separate mission.  Secretary of War Newton D. Baker summed up this opposition in his 1919 Annual Report to Congress when he not only castigated strategic bombing as expensive, but also indicated that he believed a policy of bombing urban areas presented a legal and moral dilemma that likely would stiffen an enemy’s will to resist and prove a countervalue to any war effort.289  In this atmosphere, strategic bombing theory became a detriment to the Air Service in its struggles for adequate budgets and a level of independence.   The postwar status of the Air Service as a support element was confirmed in January 1919 when a two-star artillery officer, Maj. Gen. Charles T. Menoher, became                                                 289
