tatus of the Air Service as a support element was confirmed in January 1919 when a two-star artillery officer, Maj. Gen. Charles T. Menoher, became                                                 289 War Department Annual Report, 1919 (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1920), 74-75.

Menoher was the former commander of the 42nd Division and the VI Army Group during World War I, but he had no practical experience in aviation.  More troubling than his lack of aviation experience was Menoher’s publicly stated view that the Air Service belonged to the Army and its sole purpose was direct support of the soldier in combat.290  This not only created trouble for the advocates of Air Service independence, but it spelled short-term doom for strategic bombing advocates.  In Menoher’s vision of air power, strategic bombing was a theoretical waste of time and talk of independence was tantamount to heresy.   Menoher’s viewpoints became Army policy when on 8 August 1919 Secretary Baker selected him to lead a board of four general officers to review the Air Service and determine its proper size, structure, and mission in the postwar Army.  The composition of the Menoher Board left little doubt about its direction, as three other major generals, all from the field artillery, rounded out its membership.  When the Menoher Board released its final conclusion on 27 October 1919, it was a major blow to the Air Service, but the board’s report did have some bright spots. The board’s overall conclusion seemed to sum up the future of the Air Service when it stated that aeronautics would play an increased role in future wars, but no nation could afford to maintain a large war-ready air fleet in peacetime.  Therefore, America should focus on developing a commercial aviation industry that would aid in mobilizing military aeronautics in any future war.291  The board then used this overall assessment to det
