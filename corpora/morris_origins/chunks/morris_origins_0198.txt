Therefore, America should focus on developing a commercial aviation industry that would aid in mobilizing military aeronautics in any future war.291  The board then used this overall assessment to determine that a separate air force was not desirous for two reasons.  First, it was too                                                 290 Robert P.

These two core arguments against independence--the lack of money and breaking the time-honored principles of war--would become the cornerstones of Army resistance to Air Service independence for the next two decades. Still, the boardâ€™s report was not all negative news for the Air Service.  Menoher understood that air power would be an important element of future wars.  His report shed light on the almost total lack of an American industrial system for aviation research, aircraft production, and pilot training required for long-term preparedness.  Therefore, the board recommended that Congress increase funding for military aviation and establish a single governmental agency to oversee research and development of both military and civil aviation.292 Thus, while dispelling the idea of a quick transition to an independent air force modeled on the RAF, the Menoher Board set in place long-term recommendations on aviation policy that would have tremendous payoffs for the future Air Service.  By bringing the discussion to a larger one of aviation industry, military capabilities, and the proper role and structure of an air force, the Menoher Board started America down the path to building a civil-military-industrial program that would see i
