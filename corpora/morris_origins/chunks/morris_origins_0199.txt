ion industry, military capabilities, and the proper role and structure of an air force, the Menoher Board started America down the path to building a civil-military-industrial program that would see it through the next war.   Of course, this was only a vision of the future at that point.  Even in just the year since the end of World War I, stagnation best described the state of military aviation technology.  Driven by demobilization and budget cuts, Congress and the Army favored the much cheaper policy of using surplus aircraft stocks over buying new more technologically advanced models.  This policy especially hit bombardment aviation units hard.  As a result of production ratios and manufacturing problems during the war, few                                                 292 Ibid., 6.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 190 --- 184 surplus bomber aircraft survived compared to pursuit, observation, and even attack examples.293  This translated to bombardment squadrons rapidly wearing out their surplus aircraft with few replacements available. This technological stagnation likely seeped into the doctrinal thoughts of the Air Service.  In his book Air Warfare, air power doctrine pioneer Maj. William Sherman explained the predominant view of the bomber in the early 1920s as “demanding so many sacrifices of flying qualities that all hope of retaining efficient combat power must of necessity be abandoned.  It must rely for protection on the operations of friendly pursuit aviation and its own guns.”294  This quotation highlights how the bombers of the early 1920s were seen as both critical for delivering combat power, but also technologically inferior, thus requiring air superiority before they could be brought to bear in sufficient strength to play a major role in war.   Even at this early stage, though, changes were in the offering.  The Chief of the Military Aeronautics Division, Col. Edwin E. Aldrin, described how the Air Service staff started almost immediately
