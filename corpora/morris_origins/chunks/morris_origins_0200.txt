Even at this early stage, though, changes were in the offering.  The Chief of the Military Aeronautics Division, Col. Edwin E. Aldrin, described how the Air Service staff started almost immediately to work on solving the technological stagnation problem.  Aldrin summed up the state of American aviation production in 1919 as little or no ability for aircraft or engine design.  The capabilities that did exist were created during World War I and quickly atrophied with the end of wartime budgets.295  In February 1919, Aldrin’s division was assigned the mission to fix the problem.  Just a year later, the Air Service established its own air engineering school at McCook Field, which later moved to nearby Wright Field, in Dayton, Ohio, in 1927.  While the engineering school focused on                                                 293 Edgar S.

While serving as the Chief of the Training and Observation Group of the Air Service, Billy Mitchell asked Colonel Aldrin to work towards developing high-altitude aircraft.  Aldrin described this request as the start of research that led to high-powered air-cooled engines, propeller advances, and high-altitude cooling systems, all of which aided the development of larger higher-flying aircraft.297  These innovations eventually made their way to the civilian aircraft industry and enhanced the development of a new line of aircraft with more lift, range, and s
