of larger higher-flying aircraft.297  These innovations eventually made their way to the civilian aircraft industry and enhanced the development of a new line of aircraft with more lift, range, and speed capabilities.   In effect, Mitchell’s request was the technological start of the transition from a pursuit-based Air Service to a bomber-based one.  The changes Aldrin described eventually combined with the need to buy new bomber aircraft to produce a series of long-range aircraft designs each more capable than the previous one.  Meanwhile, pursuit aviation stagnated as the ample supply of war surplus airframes restricted the need to buy new ones, and thus limited the ability of the Military Aeronautics Division to influence technological change in fighter aircraft.   The final internal shaping force affecting the Air Service was personnel issues.  In the rapid demobilization post-World War I, the Air Service lost a tremendous amount of experienced manpower to civilian flying and to state National Guard units.  The reversion of many pilots to their extremely low prewar ranks compounded the problem.  The Army’s promotion policy of grouping all officers into one pool and basing promotion                                                 296 Ibid., 7. 297 Ibid., 8.

Given the situation, it was only natural that many aviation officers became disgruntled at the system, which they saw as cutting their budgets, forcing them to fly old aircraft, discriminating against them on promotions, and now curtailing the independence they had during the war. This attitude seems to have penetrated into the psyche of the Air Service across all components in the Army.  Only one month after
