ainst the reassertion of army dominance over Air Service structure, budgets, and doctrinal thinking.  This not only produced a problem for Patrick, but it fashioned a ready-made group of supporters for Mitchell in his fight for independence.   The results of these external and internal shaping forces were codified in the National Defense Act of 1920, often called the Kahn Act after its sponsor Republican California Representative Julius Kahn.  Signed into law on 4 June 1920, the act defined the current Air Service, but also identified possibilities for air power growth in the future.  Two elements of the law were important for the Air Service.  First, the measure authorized an Army Reorganization Act that significantly reduced the size of the active duty army to just 280,000 soldiers, which was later lowered to 191,000 in February 1921. For the Air Service this meant a permanent strength only 1,514 officers and 16,000 men.301  While future funding difficulties ensured the Air Service would never reach its 17,514 personnel authorization, having congressionally approved numbers offered a level of long-term stability for planning purposes.    More important than size was the Army Reorganization Actâ€™s structural role in moving the Air Service out from underneath the Signal Corps.  In doing so, the statute created a formal position for the Air Service within the Army, even designating a major general as commanding officer and alleviating a major thorn in the side of the airmen when it prescribed that only flying officers could command aviation squadrons.302  While not addressing the other personnel issues, these two steps helped create a level of                                                 301 Kaufmann and Kaufmann, The Sleeping Giant, 15. 302 Martha E.
