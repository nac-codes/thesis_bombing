In the end, the Army Reorganization Act worked more to the Air Service’s benefit than to its detriment.  Despite reducing the service to only seven aviation groups, only one of which was bombardment, by 1921 the law’s establishment of the Air Service as a separate command element paid tremendous benefits.  A memorandum from the Director of the War Plans Division Maj. Gen. William G. Haan to General Pershing dated 6 July 1921 detailing the effects of the Army reorganization on all branches demonstrated that this separate status helped the Air Service fare better than most branches in the drawdown.    Most branches suffered approximately 50 percent reductions during this era.  Even the premier infantry suffered a 47 percent cut, going from 110,000 men to just 58,000 by the end of the year.  At the same time, the Air Service suffered only a 36 percent loss, downsizing from 16,000 to 10,300 men.303  In this way, a combination of external and internal factors set the context that air power advocates would operate in during the next decade.  The changing political environment meant less money and less equipment for air power thinkers to work with, while a high degree of Army control limited what was acceptable in terms of Air Service structure, mission, and doctrine.  Still, the basis for continued development was hidden within the context of the larger external and internal forces.  The creation of a formal Army Air Service provided just enough autonomy for air power theorists to continue their work, while the pent up frustrations of many military aviators encouraged work towards change.
