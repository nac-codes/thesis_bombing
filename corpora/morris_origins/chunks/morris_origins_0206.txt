Externally, senior aviation officers had to appear to tow the “company line” on subjugation to the Army, while internally they developed and nurtured a more congenial independent ideology.306  The problem for these aviation leaders was how to maintain the appearance of following the rules while still achieving their goal of independence.   In the next few years, three distinct approaches among the Air Service leadership emerged to advocate for independence through their own particular vision of air power and how it related to national security.  These groups roughly break down into a group that favored rebellion, a group seeking independence by working within the system, and a third group that utilized a methodology drawing on parts from the other two.  Each of these factions shared a vision for an independent Air Service, but differed on two important aspects: the methodology to achieve it and the rationality for why independence was needed.  Contained within these differences were the seeds that grew into the air power strategy of the new Army Air Service. The first group were those favoring a rebellious strategy led by Billy Mitchell.
