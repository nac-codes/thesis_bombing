ose favoring a rebellious strategy led by Billy Mitchell.  In January 1919, Mitchell returned from Europe as a man with a mission.  He was dead set on creating a new independent air force, likely with him as its first leader.  As early as 3 April 1919, he advocated before a meeting of the Navy’s General Board that the airplane’s capability to sink naval vessels required a rethinking of national defense policy.  He described how the advance of military aviation demanded structural changes to organize national defense to best utilize this new element of war.  He proposed a                                                 306Tami Davis Biddle, Rhetoric and Reality in Air Warfare: The Evolution of British and American Ideas about Strategic Bombing, 1914-1945 (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2002), 132.

Still, there are three elements of Mitchell’s saga that bear insight into strategic bombing’s evolution. The first is the rationale behind Mitchell’s desire for an independent air force. Often lost within the debates over air power’s role in coast defense was Mitchell’s key argument for independence based on a separate national defense mission that only air power could accomplish.   Protecting America from strategic attack and conversely providing a capability to conduct strategic attacks were the concepts at the core of Mitchell’s vision for air power.308  In other words, the nation must have an independent air force because the new service branch had a critical national defense mission tha
