he concepts at the core of Mitchell’s vision for air power.308  In other words, the nation must have an independent air force because the new service branch had a critical national defense mission that neither the Navy nor the Army were inclined or prepared to support fully. This overall strategic view led to Mitchell’s second contribution to the advancement of strategic bombing.  Upon Mitchell’s arrival from Europe in 1919, General Menoher appointed him as the Chief of the Air Service’s Training and Operations Group.  One of the central missions of the group was to formulate the new strategy and doctrine of the postwar Air Service.  Mitchell pulled together a strong group of subordinate officers to support his vision.  Men like Thomas Milling, William                                                 307 Alfred F.

While Mitchell helped shape these men’s visions of air power through direct interaction, he also gave them open bounds to explore different visions for air power.  On a staff tightly controlled by Menoher and tied directly to the mission of direct ground support, this was an exhilarating experience for the young officers.  Years later, Maj. Gen. James P. Hodges reflected on Mitchell’s influence in those early days as “at the time Billy Mitchell was the idol of every pilot in the Air Service.  And I suppose 99 and 9/10ths percent of them were influenced by his vision and strategies he advocated.”309  This was definitely true for the important men who served d
