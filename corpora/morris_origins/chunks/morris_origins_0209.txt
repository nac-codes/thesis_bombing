very pilot in the Air Service.  And I suppose 99 and 9/10ths percent of them were influenced by his vision and strategies he advocated.”309  This was definitely true for the important men who served directly under him developing strategy in the early 1920s.  They took away the important concept that for air power to be independent it had to have a mission and strategy that offered a war-winning capability that no other service had.   The final, if perhaps least well known, way Mitchell influenced the path of strategic bombing was through formal doctrine development.  Unfortunately, the immense attention paid to Mitchell’s public struggles obscure his integral role in shaping the early tactical manuals that formed the basis of aviation doctrine in the early 1920s.  As the Chief of the Air Service’s Training and Operations Group, Mitchell supervised the creation of a series of new postwar training manuals.  With no formal doctrine function inside the new Army Air Service’s structure, these training manuals became the de facto doctrine for the operational squadrons.                                                 309 Oral History Interview of Maj.

File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 199 --- 193 One of the first manuals to come out of the division in January 1920 was the Tactical Application of Military Aeronautics Manual.  It represented the continuation of Mitchell’s doctrinal thoughts from his World War I plans and standard operating procedures.  His depiction of the principal mission of the Air Service as “to destroy the aeronautical forces of the enemy, and, after this, to attack his formations both tactical and strategical” tied directly into his visions of a separate air power mission that could not be met by ground or naval forces.310  More important for strategic bombing, the manual went one step farther in discussing the role of bombardment aviation as “probably the greatest
