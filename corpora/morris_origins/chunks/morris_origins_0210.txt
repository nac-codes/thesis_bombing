on that could not be met by ground or naval forces.310  More important for strategic bombing, the manual went one step farther in discussing the role of bombardment aviation as “probably the greatest value in hitting an enemy’s nerve center” like a headquarters or communications node.311  In just those two sentences, Mitchell’s concept of a strategic role for air power as its defining element and bombardment aircraft as the purveyors of that role came clearly through.  Mitchell’s official role in doctrine development ended when he left the Training and Operations Group on 4 June 1920, but his later works continue to reflect this linkage between a strategic mission as a raison d'être for an independent Air Service and bombardment aviation as the means to achieve that mission.  A perfect example was his 1921 book Our Air Force where he argued that the first battle of any future war would occur in the air.  The winner of this battle could then use air power to attack enemy cities without retaliation.312  This vision of a strategic mission for the Air Service in defending America from attack and then prosecuting a strategic campaign against an enemy continued to influence doctrinal thought for years to come.                                                 310 Tactical Application of Military Aeronautics Manual, 9 January 1920, Call#167.4-1, IRIS#00120667, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL), 2. 311 Ibid., 22. 312 William Mitchell, Our Air Force: The Keystone of National Defense (New York: E.

Patrick saw military aviation at a crossroads.  He described the situation in 1920 as “there are enthusiasts, on the one hand, who believe that the coming into being of aircraft have practically scrapped all other combat agencies; and on the other hand, conservative
