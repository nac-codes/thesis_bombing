ituation in 1920 as “there are enthusiasts, on the one hand, who believe that the coming into being of aircraft have practically scrapped all other combat agencies; and on the other hand, conservatives who consider aircraft mere auxiliaries to previously existing combat branches.  The truth, of course, lies between the two views.”313  Given this adversarial relationship, Patrick favored working within the system to bring about a change in thinking that would eventually lead to a transformation of structure. Patrick and Mitchell shared a motivation for why they believed the Air Service should be independent.  Both men based their arguments on a core national security mission that only air power could achieve.  Therefore, in the long run, a separate air force structure was required to ensure the proper budget support, training, and acquisition of new aircraft to meet that mission.314  The real difference between the two men existed in how to achieve that goal.  Perhaps it was having to deal with a rebellious Mitchell or perhaps it was a sign of his maturity and time in the regular army, but in the end Patrick believed working within the system offered the best chance for success.  The final approach to independence was the group that favored using elements of both Mitchell’s and Patrick’s policies.  The best example of this group was Benjamin Foulois.  While he shared the desire for an independent air force, he differed from both Mitchell and Patrick in his rationale for why.
