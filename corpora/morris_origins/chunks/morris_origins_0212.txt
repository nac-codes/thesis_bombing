In testimony before Congress on 16 October 1919, Foulois laid out his argument when he said that “Army leadership was only interested in the defensive side of air power and had neglected the fighting side of military aviation since the end of the war.”315  Despite his attack on Army leadership, Foulois was more pragmatic than Mitchell.  He understood that independence was likely to take a series of steps to achieve.  Still, he opposed working within the system in favor of using political influence to push for quicker change.  Unfortunately for Foulois, his methodology saw little success.  He was not the vibrant visionary that drew young officers, the press, and public to him like Mitchell.  At the same time, his direct attacks on senior Army leaders limited his ability to work within the system, as these same officers came to see him as an outsider and a threat.316  In the end, Foulois had little effect on the air power debate in the early 1920s, but his approach shaped his actions when he once again emerged as the Chief of the Air Corps in the early 1930s. Each of these groups had a role in shaping the future of the Air Service and strategic bombing thought.  Mitchell’s rebellious stance drew plenty of attention and helped guide a legion of young officers towards his way of thinking in the early 1920s.  Nevertheless, when Mitchell’s approach proved detrimental to both himself and his vision for air power these young officers began to seek a new tactic.  It was then, that Mason Patrick’s long-term incremental approach won more converts.  Still, Mitchell’s concepts of a distinct national security mission based on strategic defense and attack carried on in the thinking of these young officers as they transferred their allegiance from Mitchell to Patrick.                                                   315 Army Reorganization Hearings before the Committee of Military Affairs, 66th Congress, 1919, Call#168.68-3a, IRIS#0012
