File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 202 --- 196 Doctrine Development in the Shadows The internal debate on how to achieve independence played a major role in shaping air power doctrine in the early 1920s.  Historian Tami Davis Biddle argues that when U.S. national security posture turned defensive in the years after the war, the main weapon of the Air Service, the bomber, had to take on a new defensive mission to match.317  In this way, Biddle highlights a major trend occurring in air power thought, which needed to fit what was considered a purely offensive weapon into a new defensive national strategy.  Mitchell again led the effort in this regard.  In his vision, air power was key to the strategic defense of the United States through its ability to destroy invading naval fleets.  These mental acrobatics not only helped keep air power relevant, but they helped transition the offensive theories of long-range bombing into a new defensive security mindset.   To Biddle the major trend in American air power thinking during the Mitchell era was how to make the doctrines of World War I fit into the new defensive vision of national security.  Still, this overall analysis does not shed sufficient light on the highly nuanced evolution of air power thought occurring among many mid-level Air Service officers.  Biddle’s narrow focus causes too many historians to concentrate on the role of coastal defense and the fight for independence in driving air power doctrine.  Yet, inside the important think tanks of the early Army Air Service, coastal defense was just one mission that fell within a broader vision of long-range bombing.   The first document to approach long-range bombing came from Mitchell’s Air Service T
