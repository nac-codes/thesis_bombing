y Army Air Service, coastal defense was just one mission that fell within a broader vision of long-range bombing.   The first document to approach long-range bombing came from Mitchell’s Air Service Training and Operations Division.  The group’s Tactical Application of Military Aeronautics Manual contained the three core elements of air power thought in the early                                                 317 Biddle, Rhetoric and Reality, 129.

As might be expected, this manual drew the attention and ire of many senior Army officers.  Yet, this focus by the Air Service leadership on one manual had an unintended positive effect.  The single-minded attention on Mitchell’s manual yielded a level of autonomy to the mid-level officers who developed operational and tactical guidance.   Relative independence allowed the young officers to expand strategic thought in their lower-level manuals and training texts without the direct threat of oversight.  A good example was the Aerial Bombardment Manual produced by the Training and Observation Group in April 1920.  Drafted by Thomas Milling and William Sherman, the manual was an early effort to transition long-range bombing theory from strategical to strategic.  In the manual, the authors described bombardment aviation as “becoming an important part of the Air Service, and it is believed by many that with sufficient numbers it will win a war.”318  While this statement may have been similar to the ideas advocated by Gorrell and the British during World War I, it represented the key step forward in the post-World War I Air Service.  Not only did it show that strategic bombing still percolated in the minds of airmen, but it also demonstrated they could keep it alive in their doctrinal manuals even during the reassertion of Army cont
