t only did it show that strategic bombing still percolated in the minds of airmen, but it also demonstrated they could keep it alive in their doctrinal manuals even during the reassertion of Army control. Still, the Air Serviceâ€™s staff was located close to senior Army leaders and even seemingly routine manuals often received a critical eye.  The Air Service needed an organization dedicated to developing strategy and doctrine located away from the close supervision in Washington.  In the summer of 1920, this occurred with the creation of the                                                 318 Air Service Information Circular: Aerial Bombardment Manual, April 1920, Call#167.42-1, IRIS#00121030, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL, 2.

The school traced its origins to the Army Reorganization Act of 1920, when the newly created U.S. Army Air Service started to think about how to develop its branch. Traditional Army branches like the infantry and artillery utilized a series of service schools for initial training of their young officers and then provided mid-career education on command and staff functions.  As a newly minted branch, the Air Service realized that while flight schools met their initial training needs, they also required a mid-career school to prepare young field-grade officers. This training mission merged with a new doctrine-writing mission with the War Department order in September 1921 tasking each of its combat branches to convert all their training material into a new series of formal Training Regulations.  In part to meet this requirement, Mason Patrick restructured the Training and Observation Group into the Training and War Plans Division. Yet, the new division lacked the manpower to accomplish a major manual revision, so they tasked the newly created ASTS to develop the training document.319 ASTS now had a new mission where it both train
