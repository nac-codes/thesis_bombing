t, the new division lacked the manpower to accomplish a major manual revision, so they tasked the newly created ASTS to develop the training document.319 ASTS now had a new mission where it both trained mid-level aviators for new command and staff duties and took the lead in developing air power doctrine.         Whereas ASTS spent most of 1920 training its first class of students and participating in Mitchell’s bombing experiments, 1921 saw the school turn in a new direction.  It still trained students, but work on drafting Training Regulation 440-15 pushed the school into thinking about and preparing strategy, tactics, and doctrine.  ASTS’s first commander, Maj. Thomas DeW. Milling, took a unique approach.  Instead of detailing a few instructors to write doctrine, he integrated the task into the school                                                 319 Futrell, Ideas, Concepts, and Doctrines, 40.

The new manual drew heavily from Gorrell’s June 1919 Manual for Air Service Operations, which Sherman had helped draft while working on Gorrell’s staff.321  In the new doctrine manual, Sherman identified two core air power functions: ground support and strategic bombing operations.  He even recommended proportions for the missions, arguing that strategic operations should represent 80 percent of air power missions, while only 20 percent were allotted for ground support.  This ratio was hard for many Army leaders to accept.  Perhaps it explains why the Air Service Training Regulation remained in draft format until 26 January 1926, as several boards of officers reviewed the draft and recommended changes in the interve
