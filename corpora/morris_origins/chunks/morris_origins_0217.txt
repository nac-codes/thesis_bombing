Perhaps it explains why the Air Service Training Regulation remained in draft format until 26 January 1926, as several boards of officers reviewed the draft and recommended changes in the intervening years.

On 27 March, Patrick gave a lecture to the Army’s general staff officer training school at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, titled “Fundamental Conceptions of the Air Service.”  He started by reassuring the officers that the Air Service saw its primary mission as “to assist ground forces to gain strategical and tactical success.”  Then he went on to caution that this did not mean air forces would be “under the immediate control of local commanders.” Patrick insisted that ground commanders needed to understand that for air power to be successful it had to “operate independently and sometimes far afield of the current ground operations.”323 While these examples focused on the role of air power in relation to grou
