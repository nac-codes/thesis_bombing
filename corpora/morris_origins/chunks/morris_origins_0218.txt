for air power to be successful it had to “operate independently and sometimes far afield of the current ground operations.”323 While these examples focused on the role of air power in relation to ground forces, strategic bombing theory also continued its evolution.  Determining the best methodologies to use the bomber in war often fell to the mid-level officers operating outside direct army oversight at ASTS.  Their new vision of strategic bombing started to come to life in updates to the Bombardment Course textbook used to teach students the art of long-range bombing.  The 1924 ASTS Bombardment Course text was of particular importance to strategic bombing theory development.  This new edition started by critiquing the World War I bombing campaigns.  Utilizing Gorrell’s own World War I Bombing Survey for statistical support, the document argued that strategic bombing in the war had been too haphazard to succeed.  Instead, it reasserted Gorrell’s and Tiverton’s earlier argument that target selection and concentration were tantamount for                                                 323 Lecture at Fort Leavenworth, 27 March 1924, Mason Patrick Papers, Special Collections, U.S. Air Force Academy Library, Colorado Springs, CO.

Given the Army’s oversight into Air Service doctrine, it would have been difficult to put thoughts like that into the major doctrinal manuals.  Therefore, many Air Service members took to advocating their beliefs in books outside the editorial purview of Army leaders.  In 1926, Sherman took such an approach with his Air Warfare, in which he indicated that “from the very nature of the weapon, bombardment aviation is used for strategic purposes rather than tactical.”325  Sherman then took the idea further when he foresaw four categories of future bomba
