t “from the very nature of the weapon, bombardment aviation is used for strategic purposes rather than tactical.”325  Sherman then took the idea further when he foresaw four categories of future bombardment.  These ranged from attacks on large population centers, to destroying enemy supply lines, to neutralizing fortifications, and in a reflection of the times, to the destruction of warships in coastal defense.   Even more important was Sherman’s discussion of what a future strategic bombing campaign might look like.  He argued that in modern warfare the mobilization of the military was accompanied by the mobilization of industry.  Yet, it was impossible to destroy all enemy factories.  Instead, he believed that a targeted bombing campaign could cripple the whole system by destroying certain specific elements of industrial network, which he called key plants.326  This vision of strategic bombing seems almost a precursor to Maj. Donald Wilson’s more famous Industrial Web Theory made popular at the then renamed Air Corps Tactical School in 1933. Sherman’s book admirably depicts the evolution of strategic bombing theory from 1920 to 1926.

Often working through smaller tactical manuals that attracted little attention even within the Army, these strategists continued the slow evolution of bombardment theory.  Out-of-the-way places like Langley effectively became the think tanks not only fo
