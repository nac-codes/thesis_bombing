ttracted little attention even within the Army, these strategists continued the slow evolution of bombardment theory.  Out-of-the-way places like Langley effectively became the think tanks not only for air power in general, but also in how to use its specific elements of observation, pursuit, attack, and bombardment.  In doing so, ASTS stirred the beginnings of a new round of thought that would lead to major changes in the soon to be designated Army Air Corps.  Bringing the Elements Together The theoretical work occurring on the Air Service staff and at ASTS would have meant little without concurrent structural changes to allow their implementation.  From the start, the doctrinal debates occurred against the backdrop of political fighting over the future of the Air Service.  While this political debate did have some influence on the direction of air power thought in the early 1920s, its true importance was in creating an Air Service organization capable of carrying out the developing doctrinal concepts in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The first of these structural debates occurred with the advent of the Lassiter Board in December 1922.  Throughout that year, the Air Service Chief Patrick forwarded complaints on the status and structure of the service to Secretary of War John W. Weeks.  These complaints largely revolved around the limited availability of aircraft and of issues about who should command flying squadrons in the larger army structure.  On 18 December, Weeks responded by asking Patrick to develop a study on what the proper  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 209 --- 203 structure and size of the Air Service should be and what actions were necessary to address deficiencies. Patrick based his study on Shermanâ€™s draft of Training Regulation 440-15, now widely accepted within the Air Service.  The draft regulation called for dividing the Air Service into two structural elements: the first consisting of observation aircraft assigned to division and corps
