ly accepted within the Air Service.  The draft regulation called for dividing the Air Service into two structural elements: the first consisting of observation aircraft assigned to division and corps commanders for direct support; and the second dedicated to an offensive air force consisting of bombers, pursuit, and attack aircraft under the command of GHQ reserve.  Sherman again used his 80/20 proportionality split for forces under GHQ reserve command and divisional or corps level command.327  Patrick believed that this plan offered enough aerial power to meet the daily needs of ground commanders while maintaining air power’s ability to mass the majority of its combat forces at the proper time and place to achieve larger objectives. With Patrick’s plan as a basis, Weeks appointed a board of officers in early 1923 to review the study and make recommendations, which became known as the Lassiter Board after its chairman, Maj. Gen. James Lassiter.  From the start, Patrick’s plan faced stiff opposition from Maj. Gen. Hugh Drum of the War Department’s General Staff.  Drum countered Patrick by proposing that the proper way to determine Air Service requirements was first to figure out what aviation support the divisions and corps needed and then form the remaining air power into a highly controlled GHQ reserve to meet limited long-range bombing or reconnaissance needs.328 Lassiter largely sided with Drum when he decided to use the guiding principle that aviation in the Army should be employed for participation in battle, and all strategic                                                 327 Training Regulation 440-15 draft, 1922. 328 Lassiter Board Meeting Minutes, 22 March 1923, Call#145.93-102, IRIS#00119243, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL, 5-7.
