210 --- 204 bombardment and reconnaissance should be done by aviation in the GHQ reserve.329  This position effectively countered Patrick’s plan to locate only observation planes at corps and division levels.  In the end, the Lassiter Board overruled the Army Air Service’s plan and recommended the placement of multifunction air force elements within each Army corps.  In doing so, the board believed air power was similar to other support forces and that its assets should be divided between different levels of command.  Division commanders would control observation squadrons, while each corps commander would have pursuit and attack squadrons assigned to distribute as they saw fit.  This left only a small core of bombardment squadrons with some pursuit support available for strategic missions in a GHQ reserve force.   Even with this structural setback, there were still positive elements for the Air Service in the Lassiter Board’s final report.  The most important was an acknowledgment of the deterioration of air power capabilities since the end of the war.  Lassiter even wrote that “air power has come to play an increasing role in warfare since World War I, but our nation has not kept step with the evolution.”330  To rectify the situation, Lassiter recommended that America increase the number of aircraft in the Air Service to 1,655 with 1,003 stationed in the United States and the remaining 652 with overseas garrisons.   Unfortunately, tight congressional budgets meant the Lassiter Board recommendation never coalesced into legislation to fund the new aircraft.  Still, the board was important in two respects.  First, it set out a marker for the size, structure, and mission of the Air Service.  This was now set at approximately 1,600 aircraft largely                                                 329 Ibid., 3. 330 Lassiter Board Final Report, 17 March 1923, Call# 145.93-102, IRIS# 00119242, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL.
