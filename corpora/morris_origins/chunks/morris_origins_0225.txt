eleased its findings.  In doing so, the president succeeded in taking the wind out of the congressional committee’s sails.  Far from advocating independence, the Morrow Board denied autonomy, citing unity of command issues and emphasizing that “air power has not demonstrated its value for                                                 331 Ibid. 332 Morrow Board Testimony Minutes, Call#248.211-61V, IRIS#00159949, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL.

On 2 July 1926, the Morrow Board’s recommendations were largely enacted into law when the president signed the Air Corps Act of 1926.  The law formally transitioned the U.S. Army Air Service into the U.S. Army Air Corps, but did little to increase its autonomy or to strengthen military aviation as an offensive striking arm rather than an auxiliary service.335  Still, the new law did have important benefits for air power’s future.  It established a new Assistant Secretary of War for Air position that would pay dividends in future budgetary and strategy fights.  It also helped address long-standing personnel issues by creating two new brigadier general positions.  Most important though, was its creation of a five-year expansion program to grow the Air Corps to 1,650 officers and 15,000 enlisted men operating 1,800 airplanes.336 In this way, a series of congressional and Army studies shaped the structure of the Air Service during the early 1920s.  While many view the establishment of the Air Corps in 1926 as the first
