While many view the establishment of the Air Corps in 1926 as the first step to autonomy, it was not designed that way by its instigators.  What made the new Air Corps structure the first step in independence was how the young                                                 333 Report of the President’s Aircraft Board, 2 December 1925, Call#168.65411-3, IRIS#00124933, Maxwell AFB, AL, 3. 334 Ibid., 6-7. 335 Harry H.

They view this era as the age of Mitchell and the fight for independence, not as an important step towards the bomber fleets that would rule the skies over Europe in the late stages of World War II.  There is plenty to justify their viewpoint.  The combination of geopolitical and internal forces did conspire to thwart the ascension of strategic bombing theory at the end of World War I.  This was followed by a new defensive national security strategy and a return to isolationist sentiment, which resulted in a large demobilization and tight budgets.  Finally, strategic bombing got lost in the more glamorous fight for Air Service independence conducted by highly public figures like Mitchell.  In the end, these forces combined to push strategic bombing to the periphery of military aviation.     That is not to say that strategic bombing’s evolution stopped during this era.  Instead, it continued in the shadows, often
