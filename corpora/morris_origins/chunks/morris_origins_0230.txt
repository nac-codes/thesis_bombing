unknown young aviator from Minnesota who alone in a single-seat airplane succeeded where many had failed.  On the day and night of 20-21 May 1927, Charles Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic Ocean and forever changed America’s attitude towards aeronautics.337  This new public excitement merged with the military aviators’ push for innovation in technology and strategy in the late 1920s to build the foundations for strategic bombing.  Yet, even before Lindbergh’s flight or the enactment of the Air Corps Act, doctrinal change had begun to pick up momentum in the military.  In early 1926, Maj. Oscar Westover, the commandant of the newly renamed Air Corps Tactical School released an updated version of the basic strategy manual for the Air Corps, the Employment of Combined Air Forces Manual.  The new document codified the already emerging vision of air power.  While it continued to support the Army leadership party line in stressing bombing for direct support of ground forces, the manual added a new element by contending that air power could better support ground forces through indirect attacks on command, supply, and industrial targets.338  In doing so, Westover provided a new take on the old problem for air power doctrine developers: their manuals must voice direct support of ground forces if they were to win senior Army-level approval.  Instead, Westover managed to flip this problem on its ear.  He simply redefined direct ground                                                 337 Thomas Kessner, The Flight of the Century: Charles Lindbergh and the Rise of American Aviation (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), 122-23. 338 Employment of Combined Air Forces Manual, 1926, Call#168.7045-28, IRIS#00127160, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL.
