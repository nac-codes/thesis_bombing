support to include reducing the enemy’s war resources and will to fight through strategic bombing.   Westover’s manual represented the start of a shift in thinking back to the bomber as the primary tool for air power.  The bomber offered the most support, both in a direct and indirect role, to the ground forces.  This new trend was evident in many of ACTS’s other manuals.  Even the Pursuit Course text for 1926 reflected the growing importance of bombing in the ACTS thinking.  Acknowledging that technological innovations made bombers more formidable, the text added that improvements in defensive armament made it increasingly difficult to attack bomber aircraft formations and that “attacks by individual pursuit planes in daylight would be largely limited to harassing fire.”339  While this was not a ringing endorsement for strategic bombing, it did demonstrate that bomber technology and strategy were starting to gain momentum, with even pursuit courses having to discuss the difficulties of countering bombers.  Thus, American air power doctrine was primed for change.  Unfortunately, none of the aircraft in the current inventory were in any way suited for a true strategic bombing campaign.  The primary long-range bomber of the early 1920s, the twin-engine Martin B-2 biplane, lacked the range, lifting power, and accuracy to provide anything beyond direct ground support or harassing raids.340  Needed was a catalyst to match technological evolution to the growing ideas of air power theorists.  This catalyst occurred with the Lindbergh flight.  Literally overnight, Lindbergh not only became an American hero, but he focused the attention of the nation on aviation.  Before Lindbergh’s achievement, most Americans thought of aviation as either the realm                                                 339 ACTS Pursuit Text, 1926, Call#248.282-13A, IRIS#00162278, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL, 53. 340 Jean H.
