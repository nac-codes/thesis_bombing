Both of these men helped transform Air Corps budgets, organizational culture, and doctrinal approaches. Of the two men, Fechet likely made the larger impression.  While Fechet had little operational flying experience, having spent World War I commanding flying schools in Illinois and Florida, he did have many years on the Air Service staff under his belt.  During those critical years from 1920 to 1927, Fechet became familiar with major air power issues and internal staff workings in Washington.344  Still, his biggest contribution was likely the new attitude he brought to the service.  Most notably, Fechet saw the Air Corps Act as a liberating moment for air power, interpreting the law to mean a high level of autonomy for aviation.  As such, the Air Corps could now focus much of its attention on the question of how to use air power in warfare, versus constantly struggling to gain independence or focusing narrowly on the coast defense mission.

The answer revolved arou
