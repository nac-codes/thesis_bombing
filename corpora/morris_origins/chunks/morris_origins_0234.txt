trinal development missions to ACTS.345   This brought up the next big issue for air power: how to build an Air Corps capable of meeting the new doctrines coming out of ACTS.  The answer revolved around using the five-year expansion authorized by the Air Corps Act to buy newer and more capable bomber aircraft.  Although, the law included a provision to raise the number of Army aircraft from 1,254 to 1,800 by 1932, it gave no guidance on what types of                                                 344 Official Biography Maj.

When Army leaders did approach the subject of bombers, most general staff members urged the development of an all-purpose aircraft to effect economies.347   As might be expected, this flew in the face of the Air Corps’ growing support for long-range strategic bombing.  A memorandum from the commander of the 2nd Bombardment Group, Maj. Hugh J. Knerr, best summed up the response to this outside pressure.  Kerr wrote that agreeing with this recommendation would “stifle the most powerful military weapon in the army and increase the incorrect employment of air power.”348   Fortunately, Davison’s appointment in 1926 gave the aviators an ace in the hole in these budgetary battles.  When he became Assistant Secretary of War for Air, Davison gave the Air Corps its own political representative on the Secretary of War’s staff, something no other Army organization had.  Historian Ronald Rice rightly points out that having this civilian position not liable to military rules or general orde
