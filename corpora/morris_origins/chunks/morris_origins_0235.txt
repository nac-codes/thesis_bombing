ive on the Secretary of War’s staff, something no other Army organization had.  Historian Ronald Rice rightly points out that having this civilian position not liable to military rules or general orders provided the Air Corps with a senior advocate who could work within the political system to garner more resources and alleviate budget reductions in the lean time from 1928 to 1932. During that period, Army budgets fell by 37 percent, yet the Air Corps only saw only a 12 percent decline in its funding.349  While this was surely not the sole work of Davison, his                                                 346 Air Corps Act of 1926, Call# 248.211-61E, IRIS# 00159929, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL, 7. 347 Dubuque and Gleckner, Heavy Bomber, 8. 348 Memo, Knerr to Fechet, 28 May 1928, as cited in Dubuque and Gleckner, Heavy Bomber, 57. 349 Ronald R.

Even with this new source of political power, there were technological difficulties to overcome.  Bomber designs advanced slowly, limited by both a lack of funding and a lack of leadership attention.  Despite Davison’s best efforts, no real progress on bomber acquisitions or research funding occurred from 1926 to 1928.  There were three important reasons for this stagnation in bomber design, The first was internal to the Army.  After nearly a decade of drawdowns and cutbacks, mainline capabilities like infantry and artillery were sorely in need of modernization.  Many leaders favored limiting bomber research in order to fund updates to these traditional combat arms.  Additionally, aviation was not the only new technology in the military that sought research and development funds.  In December 1927, the Army created i
