fund updates to these traditional combat arms.  Additionally, aviation was not the only new technology in the military that sought research and development funds.  In December 1927, the Army created its first experimental mechanized unit to explore how to integrate tanks into its combat plans.350  The combination of the need to refurbish the older combat arms and to test other new military technologies siphoned money away from aviation budgets, thus limiting the amounts available for bomber research and acquisition. The second reason for stagnation revolved around a political issue outside the militaryâ€™s control.   Since the demobilization after World War I, there had been little public attention to military budgets, with the notable exception of air power.  The Billy Mitchell drama helped keep people interested in aviation and provided a level of budgetary support above other elements of the Army.

On 27 August 1928, fifteen nations, including the United States signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact in Paris agreeing not to use war to settle international disputes.  By the end of the year, sixty-four nations were members of the treaty.351  One of the effects of the treaty in the United States was to reinvigorate the antiwar movement and put pressure on the government to limit military spending further.  After all, why should America invest heavily in its military if she and her potential adversaries had just agreed not to use war as a statecraft tool?  There is evidence that the Army and even the Air Corps understood the new antiwar sentiment would affect military budgets.  In his year-end report to the
