t agreed not to use war as a statecraft tool?  There is evidence that the Army and even the Air Corps understood the new antiwar sentiment would affect military budgets.  In his year-end report to the Secretary of War, Fechet warned that a rise in antimilitarism had created a tough political climate that limited the ability to buy new bombers perceived as offensive weapons.352 The final reason for holding back bomber development was the continuation of the larger fight with the Navy over air power missions.  Many historians wrongly focus on the Air Corps Act’s five-year expansion program and forget that the Navy also started its own five-year expansion with the Naval Aircraft Expansion Act of 1926, which called for a naval air force of more than 1,600 airplanes.353  Not only did this naval expansion compete for research and acquisition funds, but it also had an operational side effect that threatened Army long-range bomber production.  In 1926, the Navy reignited the simmering hostilities after Mitchell’s resignation when it announced that it would once again look into shore basing its aviation units to help with naval support and coast                                                 351 Robert H.

With no real peer competitor threatening the United States, the Army still relied on its mission of coastal defense to justify the development and purchase of long-range bombers.    The continuing disagreement with the Navy over air power missions acted as a brake in the
