ll relied on its mission of coastal defense to justify the development and purchase of long-range bombers.    The continuing disagreement with the Navy over air power missions acted as a brake in the minds of already hesitant Army leadership.  Why should they provide funds for extremely expensive long-range bomber research when that was only one small portion of the Air Corps’ perceived mission, which may be better suited to the naval aircraft?  The Navy’s success in buying fifty-four planes to protect Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal only reinforced this attitude in the Army General Staff.355  Even the bomber advocate Maj. Gen. James P. Hodges reflected on the period as not a fight between fighter and bomber advocates, but a fight between the Air Corps and the Army and Navy over missions and budgets.356  The combination of these three factors severely limited the budgets for bomber research and production.  To make matters worse, even when the Army received allocations from Congress for aviation, it did not necessarily translate into new aircraft.  Historian Jean Dubuque described how the Army became proficient at diverting appropriated money away from aviation towards other priorities during the era.  He explained how from 1926 to 1931 Congress allocated $182,759,059 for the Air Corps, yet the Secretary of War allowed only $126,136,476 of those funds to reach their intended destination.  The remaining $56,622,583 were removed from aviation budget and most likely transferred to other Army programs.357                                                  354 Rice, Politics of Air Power, 87. 355 Wildenberg, Mitchell’s War with the Navy, 155. 356 Oral History, Maj.
