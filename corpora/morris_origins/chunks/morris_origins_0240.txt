jointed strategy and tactics manuals for guidance.  Therefore, Culver decided to  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 227 --- 221 develop a baseline doctrine to utilize as an umbrella to guide the development of subordinate texts on pursuit, bombing, observation, and other missions.358   Culver summarized his new vision in a memo titled “The Doctrine of the Air Force,” which he circulated among key Air Corps staff officers on 30 August 1928.  Whereas the Army remained wedded to the view that a nation must first defeat an enemy’s army or navy before it could impose its will, Culver brought in the new concepts being espoused by military thinkers like J. F. C. Fuller and B. H. Liddell Hart that overcoming the enemy’s will to resist was the true essence of warfare.359  Hence, Culver argued that it was no longer necessary to defeat an enemy’s army or navy to win a war.  Instead, all that was required was to break the enemy’s will to fight. Perhaps even more telling was Fechet’s response to Culver on 9 September.  In his memorandum, Fechet pointed out that if taken to its logical end, this new vision of warfare meant that if “the proper means were furnished to subdue the enemy’s will…the objective of war could be obtained with less destruction.”360  What went unsaid, but was well understood by both men, was that only one capability offered a means to break the enemy’s will to resist without requiring the defeat of his army or navy first, namely air power. ACTS built on this new doctrinal direction in a major curriculum revision in 1928.  Much like the new vision of warfare, the school decided to switch its methodology completely.  Up until 1928, individual classes focused on studying what actually happened in World War I as a guide to how air power should be used.  Now the school                                                 358 Futrell, Ideas, Concepts, and Doctrines, 57. 359 Memo, Culver to Fechet, 30 August 1928, Call#K239.293, IRIS#00481811, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL
