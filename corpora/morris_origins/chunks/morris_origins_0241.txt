With an entirely new focus, the school was no longer just studying historical precedence; it now became an academic institution concentrating on the theoretical use of air power, an incubator for new ideas, logically testing them, and finally integrating them into air power doctrine.  The predominant historian of ACTS, Robert Finney, described the lasting effect of this transition as turning the school into a “cerebral testing ground for ideas, where innovative young officers could envision air power without the restraints of reality.”361 Thus, in a way, this curriculum change opened the door to a series of air power dreamers, who in turn shaped not only doctrine, but also the technology needed to carry out their visions. The results of this attitude were best seen in the new capstone course added to ACTS for the 1929 academic year titled “The Air Force.”  The new course came at the end of the year and consolidated all the ideas garnered from the individual strategy courses into a single integrated vision for the employment of pursuit, observation, attack, and bombardment aviation into one aerial battle plan.362 The Air Corps’ experiences in two important maneuvers that year reinforced these academic changes.  The first occurred when the Air Corps observed that the Navy exercises near the Panama Canal might support the Air Corp’s requirement for a long-range heavy bomber.  In the exercise, the Navy used the Saratoga to simulate a hostile fleet using carrier air power to attack the Canal Zone.  One of i
