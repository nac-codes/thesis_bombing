t support the Air Corp’s requirement for a long-range heavy bomber.  In the exercise, the Navy used the Saratoga to simulate a hostile fleet using carrier air power to attack the Canal Zone.  One of important lessons cited by the Air Corps was the need to intercept any naval force with carrier-based aircraft at least 750 to 1,150 miles out to sea in order to avoid the possibility of a devastating naval air                                                 361 Finney, History of ACTS, 28. 362 ACTS Commandant’s Annual Report, 1929, Call#245-111, IRIS#00155806, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL.

Even more important was ACTS participation in the annual V Corps area maneuvers in Ohio during May.  During these maneuvers, twin-engine Martin B-2 bomber formations played a leading role in blunting a simulated invasion force by smashing the opposing forces’ supply, communications, and command systems.  The Air Corps’ bomber forces were so successful at avoiding engagements and destroying ground targets that the lead aerial referee, ACTS staff member Maj. Walter Frank, wrote that the maneuvers indicated that “a well planned air force attack is going to be successful most of the time.”364   These operational lessons were not lost on the academic side.  Capt. Charles W. Walton’s student paper while a member of the ACTS class of 1929 clearly demonstrated how the lessons from the exercises became ingrained into the thinking of even junior students.  In the paper, Walton wrote of the maneuvers, “we can see the seeds of decisive military action, especially when aviation can operate without restrictions imposed by superior commanders.”365 The new course structure empowered junior instructors to explore ideas more deeply and to come up with their own concepts to impro
