can operate without restrictions imposed by superior commanders.”365 The new course structure empowered junior instructors to explore ideas more deeply and to come up with their own concepts to improve air power.  In 1930, two instructors in the bombardment course, Capt. Robert Olds and Lt. Kenneth Walker, used their classes to build on Franks’ observations.  They modified Frank’s assessment of the                                                 363 Wildenberg, Mitchell’s War with the Navy, 156. 364 Report of V Corps Maneuvers, 1929, Call#248.2122, IRIS#00160361, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL, 8. 365 Student Paper, Capt.

This period of rapid theoretical growth coincided with a phase of technological advancement, especially in civil aviation.  The demand for closed-cockpit, reliable high-altitude and long-distance aircraft capable of safely carrying significant loads meshed nicely with the Air Corps’ needs for a heavy bomber.  Due to this similarity, a synergy developed between civilian airliner and military bomber research.  For the military part, the Air Corps’ Material Division at Wright Field in Dayton played a large role in supporting this research.  While the Air Corps avoided researching and developing entire aircraft, its work on high-altitude engines, flight controls, and pressurization aided both the civilian and the military requirements.367  At the same time, civilian airline developers incorporated these military innovations in their new aircraft designs to produce no
