ssurization aided both the civilian and the military requirements.367  At the same time, civilian airline developers incorporated these military innovations in their new aircraft designs to produce not only better airliners but also more capable bomber aircraft.  These technological developments started to make long-range bombing feasible, but it also brought up a critical question for the Air Corps; what types of bombers were needed?  Maj. Hugh Knerr, the commander of the 2nd Bombardment Group, best described this choice as one between two types of bombers: fast medium bombers and long-range heavy bombers.368  Despite being an earlier supporter of Billy Mitchell and                                                 366 Maj.

While this may have made sense in regards to the current state of aviation technology and budget pressures to fund only smaller less costly aircraft, it started a long-term problem that would last throughout the 1930s.  Should the Air Corps utilize its limited research and acquisition budgets for highly expensive, but more capable long-range bombers or should it use its money to buy many less capable, but more flexible, medium bombers to fill out its ranks faster.  In the end, this quality versus quantity debate shaped not only the technology of the Air Corps, but also its strategy in the coming decade. It is important to note that Knerr’s position was widely accepted even at ACTS.  In early 1930, the school conducted a study of air force combat requirements and concurred with Knerr’s recommendations.  Therefore, Air Corps
