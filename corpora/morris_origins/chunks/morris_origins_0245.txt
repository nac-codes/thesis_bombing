that Knerr’s position was widely accepted even at ACTS.  In early 1930, the school conducted a study of air force combat requirements and concurred with Knerr’s recommendations.  Therefore, Air Corps research budgets were split between medium twin-engine bombers need for ground support and long-range four-engine bombers required for strategic attack missions.369   Still, these were not the only limitations on the direction of Air Corps technology.  Pressure also came from outside the military.  While congressional spending might have been tight during the late 1920s, the economic collapse of 1929 saw budgets go into a free fall.  At the start of the summer, President Hoover ordered a complete survey of the armed forces.  This initially began as a policy review, but rapidly turned into a cost-cutting drill after the collapse of October 1929.  As Hoover believed that the most likely use of military force would evolve from a minor maritime or trade dispute, he generally                                                 369 Memo, ACTS Commandant to Chief of the Air Corps, 19 March 1930, as cited in Dubuque and Gleckner, Heavy Bomber, 10.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 232 --- 226 favored cutting expensive offensive weapon systems.370  The Air Corps’ heavy bomber program seemed tailor made to fit Hoover’s reductions, as big bombers were expensive and viewed by many as offensive weapons.  Often with the Army General Staff concurrence, this attitude led to cuts in heavy bomber research and acquisition budgets. Compounding the issue were the long timelines required to bring a new bomber into active service.  In the 1920s, it took up to five years on average to design, test, build, and deploy a bomber with the Air Corps.371  Added to this timeline were more delays caused by poor congressional funding and tight budgets.  Unfortunately, the rate of technological change occurring in aircraft design meant that by the time these new bombers entered the Air Corps inventory
