by poor congressional funding and tight budgets.  Unfortunately, the rate of technological change occurring in aircraft design meant that by the time these new bombers entered the Air Corps inventory they were already obsolete.  Consequently, these factors combined to limit the numbers of bombers bought by the Air Corps in the late 1920s.  The overriding feeling seemed to be why should we spend large amounts of a tight budget buying bomber aircraft when they would be obsolete upon delivery anyway.  Would it not be better to save the money and only buy a few aircraft for training, while waiting on technological advances to stabilize before buying large numbers of aircraft?  In this way, the Air Corps ended the 1920s with only fifty-one bombers in its inventory, all of which were medium bombers.  A Return to Thinking About War, 1930-1931   Despite the limitations imposed by the Army and low budgets, the early 1930s saw a renewal of interest in contemplating air power’s role in warfare.  The changes in curriculum at ACTS were both a product of that renewed interest and a source of                                                 370 John W. Killigrew, “The Impact of the Great Depression on the Army, 1929-1936” (PhD diss., Indiana University, 1960), 11. 371 Dubuque and Gleckner, Heavy Bombers, 8.

A transforming world situation slowly awakened America to the dangers of growing fascism in Europe and militarism in Japan.  These new national security threats helped to counter antimilitarism and isolationist pressures.  Additionally, the continued rush of technological advancement spurred new thinking about air power.  As aircraft capabilities caught up to, and in many cases surpassed, the visions of men like Mitchell and Gorrell, a new generation of theorists pondered how best to use these new aeronautical capabilities to meet Americ
