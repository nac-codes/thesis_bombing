ities caught up to, and in many cases surpassed, the visions of men like Mitchell and Gorrell, a new generation of theorists pondered how best to use these new aeronautical capabilities to meet America’s security needs.  While the early stages of the Great Depression led to cost cutting in the Hoover administration, the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt to the presidency dealt an even more severe blow to Air Corps budgets.  Not only did Roosevelt seek up to a 51 percent cut in military spending, but he also effectively eliminated the Air Corps’ ace in the hole when he chose not to fill the Assistant Secretary of War for Air position.372  In one fell swoop, Roosevelt both limited funding and eliminated the Air Corps’ ability to mitigate the cuts.  Still, the Great Depression was not all negative for the Air Corps.  The social upheaval during the economic crisis had an important side effect on air power doctrine. The sudden fragmentation of the U. S. economy seemed to indicate that a national economy was much more fragile than previously thought.373  Air power advocates could see unfolding before their eyes how once the economic linkages in an economy were disrupted, the whole system might crash.  While this economic crash occurred                                                 372 Rice, Politics of Air Power, 96. 373 Biddle, Rhetoric and Reality, 147.

On one level, it decimated their attempts to acquire and develop more heavy bombers.  On the other hand, it seemed to indicate their hypothesis that bombers could wreck an enemy’s economy through disrupting critical economic nodes might be correct.  This helped buoy their morale during tough budgetary ti
