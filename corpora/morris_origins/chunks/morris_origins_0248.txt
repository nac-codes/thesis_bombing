it seemed to indicate their hypothesis that bombers could wreck an enemy’s economy through disrupting critical economic nodes might be correct.  This helped buoy their morale during tough budgetary times.  Nevertheless, the overarching effect of the Great Depression was negative on the evolution of strategic bombing theory.  Military cutbacks further reduced bomber inventories and seemed to rule out any new designs for the immediate future.  Fortunately for the Air Corps, three critical events occurred in 1931 that helped limit the effects of the budget problems. The first was the movement of ACTS from Langley Field to Maxwell Field, Alabama.  Since 1928, the Air Corps had understood that Langley Field was too busy for professional military education and doctrine development.  Because operational requirements constantly pulled instructors and students away from their studies, the service needed a quiet location away from the turmoil.  In early 1929, the Air Corps found just such a site at Maxwell, which offered an out-of-the way location where students could focus on academic work without the interruptions associated with an operational flying base in relative close proximity to Washington.375  The only limitation was the barebones status of Maxwell in 1929.  There were only a handful of buildings on                                                 374 Stephen L.

Hence, a major construction effort delayed ACTS’s move until 15 July 1931. With the new location came a new commander and a new approach.  Far removed from Washington and Army oversight, the new commander, Lt. Col. John Curry, once again modified the school’s vision.  Curry’s long career in aviation made him a perfect c
