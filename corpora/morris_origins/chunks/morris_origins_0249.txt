a new approach.  Far removed from Washington and Army oversight, the new commander, Lt. Col. John Curry, once again modified the school’s vision.  Curry’s long career in aviation made him a perfect choice to command ACTS, having flown with the 1st Aero Squadron in Mexico, experienced combat over France, and secured the purchase of Ford Island, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for Army aviation.376  Under his leadership, ACTS would now be a clearinghouse for ideas, where new concepts could be rigorously tested and doctrine created.377  The Assistant Commandant at the time, Maj. Hume Peabody, even recalled Curry telling the instructors that each was free to teach as they saw fit in order to get a debate going, “then with the ideas we get from the students, we are going to hit a happy medium.”378 Perhaps even more important, the institution started a modern library system to support the academic work.  From 1931 to 1934, Maxwell Field created a formal book department that maintained a library and directed the purchase of thousands of new books.379  The library also included an impressive collection of archival material from World War I, including Edgar Gorrell’s Air Service History of World War I and his Bombing Survey.  These became central documents used by future strategic bombing theorists to modify and develop their own thoughts.  Most notably, Maj. Donald Wilson’s                                                 376 U. S.
