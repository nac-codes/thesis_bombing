With a new attitude and a library in place, all that remained to realize Curry’s vision was a central concept on which to base the new doctrine.  In late 1932, Lt. Kenneth Walker spelled out the central tenets of the core doctrine in a memorandum critiquing a new Air Corps field manual sent to the ACTS commander.  In the memo, Walker took issue with bombardment aviation’s depiction stressing that three principles must guide all future doctrine.  First, bombardment aviation was the basic arm of the air force.  Next, for bombing to be effective, precision targeting was key.  The only way to accomplish this was through daylight bombing.  Finally, air power was too costly to waste; therefore, bombing raids must be focused only against targets vital to the enemy’s economy.381  In this way, Walker’s memorandum included the skeleton of the future high-altitude precision daylight bombing doctrine.  Although much more work would be required to turn Walker’s recommendations into formal doctrine, it was a crucial document that laid the groundwork for strategic bombing The second event of 1931 to aid the rise of strategic bombing was the settlement of a major interservice thorn in the side of the Air Corps that drew both attention and resources away from heavy bomber development.  On 9 January 1931, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Adm. William V. Pratt reached on agreement on coast defense roles for air power.  MacArthur explained the agreement in a memorandum titled Employment of                                                 380 ACTS Bombardment Text, 1933, Call#241.111, IRIS#468620, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL. 381 Mem
