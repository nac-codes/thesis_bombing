explained the agreement in a memorandum titled Employment of                                                 380 ACTS Bombardment Text, 1933, Call#241.111, IRIS#468620, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL. 381 Memo, Walker to Curry, 24 September 1932, Call#248.211-13, IRIS#00159577, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL.

In the memo, MacArthur explained that “naval forces will be based on the fleet and move with it as an impartial element in performing the essential mission of defending the fleet afloat.  The Army air forces will be land based and employed as an element in carrying out its mission of defending the coast, both in the homeland and overseas possessions.”382  This agreement left the Army and Navy air forces free to develop within defined limits each with explicit missions.   Still, in 1931, the agreement represented a giant leap forward for the Air Corps.  It temporarily settled one long-standing issue that drew staff attention away from doctrine discussions and provided a mission justification for developing long-range heavy bombers with a thousand-mile range.  As Air Force historian Maurer Maurer noted, the agreement “sanctioned a justifiable reason for developing long-range bombers for coastal defense.”383 Finally, 1931 saw two important technological advances that helped secure the success of strategic bombing doctrine.   The first of these was the Martin B-10, the first all-metal monoplane bomber bought by the U. S. Army Air Corps.  Its capabilities were an impressive technological leap forward, with a top speed of 213 miles per hour, a 24,000-foot service ceiling, and a range of 1,000 miles.384  While technically still a twin-engine medium bomber, the B-10 promised that advancing technology would finally make heavy bombers a reality.  As such, it generated excitement in ACTS, where
