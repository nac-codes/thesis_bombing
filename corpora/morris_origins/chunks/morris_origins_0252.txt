a twin-engine medium bomber, the B-10 promised that advancing technology would finally make heavy bombers a reality.  As such, it generated excitement in ACTS, where                                                 382 Memo, MacArthur to Commanding Generals, Armies, Corps, and Departments, 13 January 1931, Call#168.3952-91, IRIS#00123080, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL.  383 Maurer Maurer, Aviation in the U.S. Army 1919-1939 (Washington, DC: Office of Air Force History, 1987), 289. 384 J.

File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 238 --- 232 students and faculty alike redoubled their efforts to build a strategy for the new heavy bombers they felt sure were only a few years away. Unfortunately for the Air Corps, the B-10 and its lineage lacked one important element critical to meeting ACTS’s developing vision of strategic bombardment: precision.  As fate would have it, another invention in late 1931 appeared to offer the accuracy needed by any bomber the Air Corps chose to buy.  In October, Air Corps officers observed the naval test of Carl L. Norden’s new bombsight.  Their notes indicated they believed this could be the device finally to make high-altitude strategic bombing possible and they recommended its immediate purchase.385   The Air Corps faced a dual challenge in acquiring the Norden bombsight, though.  First, they had to overcome Army reluctance to buy a new technology that supported high-altitude strategic bombing, when they preferred smaller medium bombers to help meet budget limitations and keep the Air Corps focused on its ground support role.  Second, the Norden bombsight was already on contract with the Navy.  With the bad blood between the two services, there was no way the Navy would give the Air Corps the rights to manufacture its own version of the sight.  This was especially important, considering the Air Corps wanted to use them in the l
