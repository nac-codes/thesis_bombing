rvices, there was no way the Navy would give the Air Corps the rights to manufacture its own version of the sight.  This was especially important, considering the Air Corps wanted to use them in the long-range coast defense mission, while naval air still saw as its role.  In the end, an agreement was reached to buy Nordens from the Navy, but this proved inefficient until the requirements of World War II forced the two services to work together.386 In this way, the first two years of the new decade were primarily driven by budget constraints.  Still, the Air Corps did not let its monetary woes completely distract it from                                                 385 Maurer, Aviation in the U.S. Army, 289. 386 MacFarland, Precision Bombing, 72-73.

Three important events in the critical year of 1931 helped advance strategic bombing and position it for wider acceptance as the decade continued.  Moving ACTS from Langley to Maxwell provided new freedom that was matched by an openness to academic innovation that spurred new ideas.  The MacArthur-Pratt Agreement both removed a thorn from the side of aviation leaders and also gave them a mission justification to support the purchase of heavy long-range bomber aircraft.  Finally, the rapid pace of both aircraft technology and accurate bombsights indicated that heavy bombers were not only on the way, but that they would likely meet the vision of the air power theorists.  Creating an Organization, 1932-1934 When Maj. Gen. Benjamin Foulois became Chief of the Army Air Corps on 22 December 1931, he brought a wealth of knowledge with him.  He was the most experienced aviator in the Air Corps, having been the founding pilot in the new Air Service in 1909.
