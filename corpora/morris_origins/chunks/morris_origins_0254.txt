Service in 1909.  He brought operational experience commanding the 1st Aero Squadron during the Mexican Expedition and as the commander of the AEF Air Service in the early days of America’s involvement in World War I.  Still, perhaps his most important experience for this position was his three years as military attaché in Berlin in the 1920s.  His work with the Germans convinced him that they would once again rise to threaten Europe, this time using air power as their primary means of conquering the continent.387  Thus, Foulois took charge of the Air Corps with a desire to increase the funding for heavy bombers as a counterweight to the threat of a resurgent Germany.                                                   387 Futrell, Ideas, Concepts, and Doctrine, 60-62.

On 8 February 1933, Foulois sent a memorandum to Brig. Gen. Charles E. Killbourne, the Army Assistant Chief of Staff, referencing a discussion the two men had with General MacArthur in December 1932, which had identified a structural problem that limited air power’s effective use in war.  While most observation and some pursuit squadrons were under the command of corps or district commanders, the vast majority of Air Corps combat power resided under the GHQ Reserve Commander.  Foulois pointed out that this command and control system limited air power’s effectiveness, as there was no centralized structure to train, support, and command these air force in a time of emergency or war.388 Foulois did not stop at just complaining.  He ended the memorandum by laying out his recommendations for a new tactical structure for the Air Corps.  Foulois recommended creating a command entity to control offensive air power centrally in both peacetime and war, to be called the GHQ Air Force.389  While Army Corps commanders would retain observati
