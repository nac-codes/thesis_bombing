Foulois recommended creating a command entity to control offensive air power centrally in both peacetime and war, to be called the GHQ Air Force.389  While Army Corps commanders would retain observation and some pursuit aircraft for support, Foulois envisioned the Air Corps’ bombers falling under this new combat command.  This independent force operating directly under the supervision of the overall ground forces commander would centrally plan, coordinate, and execute aerial attacks against enemy forces.  Furthermore, Foulois felt this command should fall under the authority of the Chief of the Air Corps, but at a minimum should be directly commanded by an airman. This approach must have had an effect on MacArthur, for on 11 August 1933 he convinced Secretary of War George H. Dern to appoint a board of officers led by Maj.                                                 388 Memo, Foulois to Killbourne, 8 February 1933, Call#168.68, IRIS#125297, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL, 2. 389 Ibid., 8.

The Drum Board’s report was not a total win for the Air Corps, but it did significantly enhance its position on strategic bombing.  The board continued to maintain the traditional Army control over aviation when it started with the admonition: “Whether operating in close conjunction with the Army or Navy, or at a distance therefrom, all of these agencies must operate in accordance with one general plan of national defense.”390  Still, there was much in the report to hearten the Air Corps.  Most notably, its conclusion that “a properly constituted GHQ Air Force, a unit heretofore lacking, could detect the approach of an enemy force, attack it before it reached shore, oppose a landing, and support ground operations against an invader.”391 The GHQ Air Force would not become operational until 1935, but work proceeded in accordance with the Drum Report on its struc
