e, oppose a landing, and support ground operations against an invader.”391 The GHQ Air Force would not become operational until 1935, but work proceeded in accordance with the Drum Report on its structure and doctrine for employment.  Perhaps the most important part of the GHQ’s formation occurred when MacArthur approved its first doctrine for employment on 17 October 1934.  This doctrine manual, like the earlier Drum Board report, was a mixed bag.  On one hand, it clearly stated, “the idea that aviation can replace any of the other elements of our armed forces is found to be erroneous.”392  Thus, it continued to limit further talk of Air Corps independence.  On the other hand, though, the document provided enough autonomy for the Air Corps to pursue strategic bombing when it concluded, “the GHQ Air Force will operate as a homogenous unit, capable of operations in close cooperation with ground                                                 390 Drum Board Report, 11 October 1933, Call#168.7130-5, IRIS#01034484, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL, 1. 391 Ibid., 12. 392 Doctrine for Employment of the GHQ Air Force, 17 October 1934, Call#145.93-95, IRIS#00119236, AFHRA, Maxwell, AFB, AL, 3.

Before the idea of a GHQ Air Force, strategic bombing was always a concept, an idea that showed promise, but that had no real path to doctrine inside the Army or even the Air Corps.  With the advent of the GHQ Air Force, there was now a command structure that could take the ideas of ACTS and the technological developments of the Material Division and turn them into actual operations.  In this way, biographer John Shiner concluded that perhaps Foulois’s greatest achievement as Chief of t
