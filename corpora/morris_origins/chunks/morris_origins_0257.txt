In this way, biographer John Shiner concluded that perhaps Foulois’s greatest achievement as Chief of the Air Corps was establishing a GHQ Air Force that provided the organizational structure for command and control of the strategic mission.394  Conclusion The era of 1926 to 1934 saw the continuation of the organizational, technological, and budgetary limitations from the early 1920s.  The world situation and America’s self-perceived role in that world had not changed significantly.  If anything, the advent of the Depression exacerbated America’s tendency toward isolationism and antimilitarism in the late twenties and early thirties.  This created a growing set of political, economic, and social forces that influenced the direction of air power thought.  These shaping forces centered on three key issues: money, defense policy, and the state of aerial technology.  All were found wanting in one way or another in the late 1920s.                                                   393 Ibid., 4. 394 John F. Shiner, Foulois and the U. S.

The growing popular support for aviation after Charles Lindbergh’s famous flight helped spur excitement for civil aviation that led to the rapid advancement of airliner technology.  These advances eventually spilled over into military bomber technology, with increases in range, payload, and speed, making the bomber as capable, if not more capable, than most American fighters of the time.   Advocates at ACTS quickly seized on the new capabilities to proclaim that the bomber was becoming an unstoppable force.  This married nicely with the new emphasis on thinking of air power in the
