luded such luminaries as Karl Compton, Clarence Chamberlin, James Doolittle, Edgar Gorrell, and George Lewis.  Meanwhile, the military contributed a group of highly experienced officers such as Maj. Gen. Hugh Drum, Maj. Gen. Benjamin Foulois, Maj. Gen. George Simonds, Brig. Gen. Charles Kilbourne, and Brig. Gen. John Gulick.398  This represented perhaps the most experienced grouping of aviation experts ever to study the Air Corps mission, resources, and performance. At the first meeting, the board laid out its task of considering how the Air Corps Act of 1926 had shaped military aviation and determining what actions were needed to correct any deficiencies. It then proceeded to break the work into three categories of study.  First, did the Air Corps have the best technology available?  Next, was its training sufficient?  Finally, did structural deficiencies limit Air Corps effectiveness?399  With this mission, the board heard from 105 witnesses over twenty-five sessions before releasing its final report on 18 July 1934. As with previous boards, the Baker Board’s results were a mixed bag.  On one level, it once again closed the door on further talk of autonomy with statements like: “The idea that aviation can replace any other element of our armed force is found, on analysis, to be erroneous.”  To make matters worse for advocates of an independent air force, it also recommended that any future aerial expansion should occur only as part of a                                                 398 Meeting Minutes of the Special Committee on Army Air Corps and the Air Mail, 17 April 1934, Call#167.66-1, IRIS#121594, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL, 2. 399 Ibid., 17-19.

Yet, the Baker Board’s report also contained findings that aided the Air Corps and in the long run the bomber advocates.
