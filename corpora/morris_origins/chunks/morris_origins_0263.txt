emed to make the job of building support for strategic bombing more difficult. Yet, the Baker Board’s report also contained findings that aided the Air Corps and in the long run the bomber advocates.  One of the most important structural problems was the lack of aviation representation on the Army General Staff, which “may account for some of the misunderstanding and erroneous impressions concerning air power.”  The report then went further to speculate that this faulty relationship might explain the lack of an adequate operational command and control to organize, train, and coordinate air power during a military crisis.401  The board felt this lack of structure hindered the effectiveness of air power; hence, it strongly supported the establishment of the new GHQ AF to fill the command and control gap. Finally, the Baker Board decried the state of Air Corps technology.  It cited the strong advances in civilian aviation as a model for the Army.  It even recommended supporting linkages between the Air Corps and the aviation industry.  In a section influenced by the old bombing advocate Edgar Gorrell, the board recommended that “officers should be developed who were especially qualified in engineering and for dealing with industry.”402  Along these lines, Foulois asked the Air Corps’ Material Division to create a personnel development program with three objectives: tactical experience, academic training, and practical experience.403  Thus, the Baker Board helped                                                 400 Report of War Department Special Committee on Army Air Corps, 18 July 1934, Call#145.93-94A, IRIS#00119235, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL, 14, 75. 401 Ibid., 26. 402 Ibid., 21. 403 Memo, Foulois to Assistant Chief of Staff G-3, 8 January 1935, Call#145.93-94, IRIS#125295, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL.
