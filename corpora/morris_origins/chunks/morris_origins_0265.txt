Large mixed aircraft units directly tied to Army corps commanders proved unwieldy.  Instead, single-aircraft-type wings synchronized from a central command element offered simpler logistics, better coordination, and the ability to mass air power at the decisive time and place.  This is exactly what strategic bombing advocates needed: a command structure utilizing technology to allow long-range bombers to interact with escort fighters while conducting an independent campaign.   Still, strategic bombing theory needed a methodology to become an approved doctrine.  To this point, its most important advances had been through student papers, instructor discussions, and tactics manuals.  For strategic bombing to make the leap from discussion topic to fully accepted doctrine it needed a formal process.  Unfortunately, the Air Corps lacked either a procedure or an organization for creating doctrine.  When ACTS moved from Langley Field to Maxwell Field the previous doctrinal organization--the Air Board--ceased functioning.   By 1933, this situation was unacceptable.  In calling for a new Air Board, the Plans Division pointed out that the Air Corps still relied on the 1922 Training Regulation 440-15 for its officially approved aerial doctrine.  Reacting to the need, the Air Corps reestablished the Air Board at Maxwell on 17 August 1933 with the same mission, members, and linkages to ACTS as the old Langley board.405  Once instituted, the new                                                 404 “2nd Bombardment Wing Exercise Report,” Col.
