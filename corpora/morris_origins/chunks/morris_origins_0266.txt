File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 251 --- 245 members determined to modify the board’s mission similar to the way ACTS had transitioned from a tactical school at Langley into a theoretical strategy development organization at Maxwell.  Therefore, in August 1934, the board members convinced the Air Corps to change the name of the board to the Air Corps Board with a concurrent mission change to develop uniform doctrines.406  The establishment of the Air Corps Board also had the effect of instilling a new emphasis on doctrine development at ACTS.  When combined with the growing size of the student body, it pushed the school to restructure its entire curriculum.  By the 1935 academic year, over 50 percent of instruction was related to air tactics and doctrine.407  Additionally, course structure also changed with most classes moved to a twenty-minute lecture followed by fifty minutes of student discussion.408  This schedule allowed faculty and students to bring up new concepts, logically test them in open discussion, and pursue specific ideas in additional research.  If these ideas attracted enough support, the Air Corps Board often turned them into formal studies. Thus, political changes helped spur organizational modifications that created the conditions needed for strategic bombing theory to become strategic bombing doctrine.  The transformations at Maxwell and the establishment of the GHQ AF provided the process to develop new doctrines and an organization to test them.  What it still lacked was the technology to implement the new doctrines.   The tremendous technological change in the mid-1930s set the stage for the advent of strategic bombing; although this trend was not so obvious to observers
