technology to implement the new doctrines.   The tremendous technological change in the mid-1930s set the stage for the advent of strategic bombing; although this trend was not so obvious to observers at that                                                 406 Memo, Commander ACTS to Chief of the Air Corps, 14 August 1934, Call#145.91-409, IRIS#118861, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL. 407 ACTS Instructors Memo #10, 12 February 1935, Call#248.126, IRIS157746, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL. 408 Finney, History of ACTS, 20.

Hugh Knerr’s recommendation to split development funds between medium and long-range bombers led to the 1933 dual specifications for new bomber designs.  The first was for a medium bomber that could carry a 2,000 lb. bomb load for 1,000 miles at 200 miles per hour.  The second was for a long-range heavy bomber capable of carrying similar loads for 5,000 miles also at 200 miles per hour.409   In response to the requirements, two new aircraft designs garnered excitement in the Army and its Air Corps.  For the medium bomber, the Douglas Aircraft Company produced the twin-engine B-18.  Its ability to meet all medium bomber specifications and its initial price tag of only $58,500 made it the clear favorite of the Army General Staff.  On the other side, the four-engine Boeing B-17 appeared to be the perfect aircraft for the heavy bomber advocates.  Its initial range of 2,600 miles and top speed of 250 miles per hour offered what General Arnold labeled “air power you could put your hands on.”410   The Air Corps was so excited by the B-17 that they requested 65 of them in place of 180 other aircraft previously authorized for fiscal year 1936.  The service may have even succeeded in getting the bombers except for the crash of the B-17 prototype before the Army could conduct official trials.
