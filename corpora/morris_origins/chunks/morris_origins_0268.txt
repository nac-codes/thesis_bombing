eeded in getting the bombers except for the crash of the B-17 prototype before the Army could conduct official trials.  While the failure of the test crew to unlock rudder and elevator controls and not inherent design problems caused the crash, the acquisition delay gave the opponents of heavy bombers time to mount a challenge.411   The result was an internal debate about the proper aircraft to meet the Air Corps’ combat mission.  On one side, the Air Corps favored the heavy bomber for its capabilities                                                 409 Richard J.

The Air Corps even argued that the heavy bomber was not solely designed for strategic bombing, its capabilities also making it a cost-effective weapon in defending America’s coastlines or supporting ground troops.  The Army General Staff countered with three arguments of its own.  First, the B-18 cost about half that of a B-17; hence, they could buy twice as many with the same amount of funds.  Next, the medium bomber would keep the Air Corps focused on its proper role: ground support.  Finally, the heavy bomber was too offensive and ran counter to America’s stated defensive national security policy.412 Luckily, the Air Corps received an unexpected ally in Army Chief of Staff Gen. Douglas MacArthur.  MacArthur turned out to be supportive of increasing all bombers, even declaring to his staff that the bomber was the most important element of the GHQ AF because it could disrupt an enemy’s rear op
