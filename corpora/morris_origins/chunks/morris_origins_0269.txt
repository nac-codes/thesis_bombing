.  MacArthur turned out to be supportive of increasing all bombers, even declaring to his staff that the bomber was the most important element of the GHQ AF because it could disrupt an enemy’s rear operations as no other weapon could.413  While this was not a ringing endorsement of strategic bombing, it provided sufficient affirmation for the Air Corps to continue buying heavy bombers and researching future technologies. Still, opposition to the heavy bomber program remained entrenched in the General Staff.  Led by the G-4, Brig. Gen. George R. Spalding, the General Staff pressed MacArthur to forgo the B-17 in favor of the B-18.  Spalding appealed to two elements he knew the chief would favor.  First, the low cost of the B-18 meant MacArthur could build a large bomber force in less time.  Next, the medium bomber was more inline with                                                 412 Jean H. Dubuque and Robert F.

Finally, Spalding claimed the B-17 was too offensive and completely out of step with MacArthur’s and America’s vision for national defense.414   In the end, the untimely crash of the B-17 prototype and General Staff opposition forced the Air Corps to take extreme measures to keep the program alive.  In November 1936, Major General Westover used his authority under section 10(K) of the Air Corps Act to buy thirteen Boeing B-17s for experimental service testing.415  While this in no way ended the fight between the General Staff and the Air Corps, it did keep the heavy bomber program alive long enough to fight another day. As might be expected, these political, organizational, and technologi
