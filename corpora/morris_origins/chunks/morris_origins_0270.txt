he fight between the General Staff and the Air Corps, it did keep the heavy bomber program alive long enough to fight another day. As might be expected, these political, organizational, and technological developments caused commensurate modifications in the Air Corps’ strategic thinking.  Although not as dramatic as those of the early 1930s, these changes were important in rounding out strategic bombing theory.  The first change occurred when Maj. Donald Wilson updated his bombardment lecture for the 1934 academic year.  With the growing attention given to heavy bombers, Wilson dove headlong into the archives to rediscover the writings of Edgar Gorrell.  Wilson was drawn to Gorrell’s discussion on targeting industrial systems.  He was so interested in the writings that he started a correspondence with Gorrell on the issue.416 Based on this research and his own ideas, Wilson developed a more sophisticated approach to bombardment aviation.  In what he later called the Industrial Web Theory, Wilson argued that the interdependence of a national economy meant that not all factories                                                 414 Memo, Spalding to MacArthur, 8 August 1936, AG452.1, box#2583, RG#407, National Archives. 415 Memo, Westover to Adjutant General, 8 November 1935, AG452.1, box#2583, RG#407, National Archives. 416 Oral History Interview, Maj.

Instead, attacking key nodes would be enough to disrupt an entire economy.417  It is important to note that this idea was not new.  Col. Edouard Bares, Lord Hardinge Tiverton, and even Edgar Gorrell had at least in part discussed similar concepts in their World War I writings.  While there is no direct evidence of a causal relationship, it is possible Wilson’s readings and discussions with Gorrell helped spur his thoughts on the issue.
