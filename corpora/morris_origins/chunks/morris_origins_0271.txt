While there is no direct evidence of a causal relationship, it is possible Wilson’s readings and discussions with Gorrell helped spur his thoughts on the issue.  Either way, this time something different occurred.  Wilson had the advantage of time to take his thoughts beyond just theory and to start to turn them into a workable plan. With the help of one of his students, Capt. Robert M. Webster, Wilson began to turn his ideas into something tangible.  Figuring most major cities worldwide would have similar networks and vulnerabilities, the two men gathered data from New York City infrastructure managers on water, gas, electrical, transportation, and public safety systems.  They then compared those categories to Air Corps capabilities to determine the best places where air power could be brought to bear against industrial vulnerabilities.418   Westover aided Wilson’s efforts by focusing the Air Corps on finally updating its approved doctrine.  In June 1935, he directed the Air Corps Board to formulate a uniform doctrine in order to justify future budget requests.  Learning from the concurrent fight with the General Staff, he believed a threefold mission of continental defense, ground support, and strategic operations would best ensure the service’s access to heavy bombers.419                                                   417 Ibid., 8. 418 “Student Research Project on New York City Statistical Data,” Capt.

This was to be a three-way contest among the Army General Staff, the Air Corps, and to a lesser extent the Navy.  The General Staff and the Navy sought to limit at leas
