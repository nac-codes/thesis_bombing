next roles and mission fight.  This was to be a three-way contest among the Army General Staff, the Air Corps, and to a lesser extent the Navy.  The General Staff and the Navy sought to limit at least one of the components, whereas the Air Corps fought what it perceived as a life-or-death struggle to maintain all three missions.  In the end, defining the battleground helped stiffen the airmen for the coming struggle over the future of American military aviation.  The Great Bomber Fight, 1936-1939 On the surface, the political, organizational, and technological changes from 1934 to 1936 seemed to support the growing influence of bombing advocates.  Nevertheless, the old opponents of air power independence continued to attack any plan that threatened greater autonomy or perhaps independence.  This fight mostly occurred outside the political limelight in the interworking of staff procedures and budgetary processes.   The first round occurred with the 2 October 1935 ascension of Gen.

Craig entered into leadership as a man with a mission.  He wanted to use his tenure to rebuild the traditional combat elements of the Army.  In order to accomplish the task, Craig pressured the entire Army to limit research and development expenditures in favor of buying readily available weapons.420 This coincided nicely with the General Staffâ€™s opposition to the heavy bomber.  Even before Craig became Chief of Staff, they attacked efforts to acquire more B-17s                                                 420 Ibid., 79.
