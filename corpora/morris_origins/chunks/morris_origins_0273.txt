ed a study that ruled the bomber met no current or future Army missions and thus should be defunded.421   The study did allow the purchase of a few experimental bombers, but in effect it precluded buying new operational heavy bombers.  The policy also acted as a major roadblock for ACTS strategy development, as there would be no heavy bomber units with which to test theories in maneuvers.  Likely based on this policy, Craig turned down Westover’s request to buy two groups of B-17 aircraft, downgrading the request to two-engine medium bombers.422 The Air Corps’ leadership did not take this challenge lying down.  They returned the General Staff’s fire using a three-part strategy.  First, the Air Corps directly attacked the logic of the Army’s decision to ban heavy bombers.  The GHQ AF’s first commander, Brig. Gen. Frank M. Andrews, led the attack when he sent a strongly worded memorandum to the Chief of Staff explaining why the Air Corps needed heavy bombers.  Andrews carefully avoided confusing the issue with talk of strategic bombing; instead, he kept his arguments safely founded on approved Air Corps’ missions.  He first utilized air power’s coast defense role by arguing that the United States needed long-range heavy bombers to “stop hostile air expeditions at their source.”  He then added that heavy bombers were the most adaptable weapon for finding and countering enemy aircraft carriers.  Most important, if the Army did not approve the purchase of B-17s now, they would not have a long-range strike capability if and when America entered its next                                                 421 War Department Staff Study: Augmentation in Aircraft to be included in FY 1938 Estimates, 25 June 1936, included in Arnold Papers, Call#28211, IRIS#089007, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL. 422 Robert W.
