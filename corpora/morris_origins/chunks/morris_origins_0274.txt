Even after this memorandum stirred up controversy, Andrews remained the most vocal critic of Army policies limiting heavy bombers.  He next targeted the General Staff in a series of speeches at the Army War College, proclaiming that “bombardment aviation is and always will be the principal striking force in air operations.”  Therefore, to limit heavy bombers was to throw away the weapon with the most potential to inflict losses on an enemy.424  This was not simply a statement to a neutral audience.  At the time, men who fully supported the General Staff’s position constituted the Army War College faculty.  Thus, Andrews was in a way walking into the lion’s den with his speeches challenging the General Staff’s policies. As might be expected, trying to change the General Staff’s deeply held beliefs through logical arguments proved unfruitful.  Therefore, the Air Corps turned its attention to seeking further mission justifications for heavy bombers.  The changing world situation aided its efforts by modifying American national security strategy towards the idea of hemispheric defense.  The ever closer relationship among Germany, Italy, and Japan in 1937 had a clarifying effect on American defense thinking, which the military aviation historian Thomas Greer summed up as being “no longer a direct threat of invasion, but concern over Axis subversion and incursions into central and South America.”425                                                 423 Memo, Andrews to Chief of Staff, 14 September 1936, AG452.1, box#2583, RG#407, National Archives. 424 Maj.
