423 Memo, Andrews to Chief of Staff, 14 September 1936, AG452.1, box#2583, RG#407, National Archives. 424 Maj. Gen. Frank Andrews lecture “The GHQ AF” at the Army War College, 9 October 1937, Call#248.211-62G, IRIS#00159966, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL, 20-21. 425 Thomas H. Greer, The Development of Air Doctrine in the Army Air Arm, 1917-1941 (Washington, DC: Office of Air Force History, 1985), 76.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 259 --- 253 Troubled that their sole mission justification for heavy bombers was coast defense, the bomber advocates seized on this new political concern.  They argued that long-range heavy bombers were the most efficient and effective way for the United States to enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the late 1930s.  The Air Corps even went as far as to task the Air Corps Board with studying how air power could support the modern Monroe Doctrine.  Its findings were released in October 1938, when the board concluded that hemisphere defense was an integral mission that air power could best conduct without the costly need for large fleets or massive ground force deployments.426  ACTS later followed up with its own analysis.  It concluded that for a competent defense of the Western Hemisphere, the Air Corps needed twenty squadrons of long-range heavy bombers with bases in Panama, Puerto Rico, and possibly Brazil.427  This plan became the final linkage between a new role in hemisphere defense and the justification for the purchase of a large number of heavy bombers. The Air Corps’ third line of attack was to let the technology speak for itself, as the B-17 was simply too impressive an aircraft to ignore.  In May 1937, GHQ AF sent its first seven experimental B-17s to participate in joint Army-Navy maneuvers off the Pacific Coast.  The B-17s easily outperformed the older B-10 bombers, achieving several hits on the battleship Utah with as little as five seconds run in time using the new Norden bombsight.428  The bomber’s performance
