B-17s easily outperformed the older B-10 bombers, achieving several hits on the battleship Utah with as little as five seconds run in time using the new Norden bombsight.428  The bomber’s performance was so exceptional that it led the GHQ AF Chief of Staff, now Col. Hugh J. Knerr, to declare that the B-17 was “the best                                                 426 Report of the Air Corps Board No. 44, 17 October 1938, Call#3794-44, IRIS#121165, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL, 3. 427 “A Study of Air Defense of the Western Hemisphere,” 12 May 1939, Call#145.93-141, IRIS#00119305, AFHRA, Maxwell, AFB, AL, 7. 428 Andrews lecture, “The GHQ AF,” 8.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 260 --- 254 bombardment aircraft in existence.”429  While Knerr’s proclamation may have been overreaching, most Air Corps officers supported his assertion that the B-17 was truly a remarkable airplane that offered a high bomb load, greater accuracy, and longer ranges than any other aircraft then available to the Army.  Even if not used in a strategic role, the B-17 offered capabilities that Army leadership had to recognize as beneficial. Of course, the General Staff did not just roll over and surrender.  They countered with their own arguments of why the B-17 was the wrong aircraft at the wrong time.  First, they maintained the focus on the cost, constantly citing the $280,000 cost per B-17 as compared to only about $120,000 per B-18.430  The General Staff argued the cost of this one weapon system would preclude Craig from reconstituting the ground forces, thus creating a lopsided Army, which it knew would cut deep into Craig’s balanced restructuring vision. Next, the General Staff looked for a counter-argument to the success of the B-17 in maneuvers.  The early use of aircraft in the Spanish Civil War and the Italian invasion of Ethiopia bolstered their position.  Attaché reports from each war indicated that high-altitude bombing was largely ineffective.  This caused the Army War College to
