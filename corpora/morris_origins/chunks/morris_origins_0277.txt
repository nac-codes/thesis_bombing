vil War and the Italian invasion of Ethiopia bolstered their position.  Attaché reports from each war indicated that high-altitude bombing was largely ineffective.  This caused the Army War College to conclude that current worldwide military operations supported the conclusion that the best method to employ air power was in support of ground forces.431   Craig added fuel to the fire when he restricted overwater flights to 100 miles.  This seemed to play into the hands of the Navy when it modified the Joint Action                                                 429 Memorandum, Knerr to Andrews, 31 July 1937, Call# 168.7028-11, IRIS#126511, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL. 430 Memo, Deputy Chief of Staff to Chief of Staff, 29 November 1938, AAG 452.1b, box#2583, RG#407, National Archives. 431 Army War College report: “Air Forces and War,” September 1937, Call# 168.7330-1501, IRIS#2053765, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL.
