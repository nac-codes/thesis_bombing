Spalding likely felt the combination of naval officers and the heavy presence of General Staff officers on the board would combine once and for all to end the debate on heavy bombers.  On 29 June 1938, the board released its report indicating there was no probable military requirement for aircraft larger than B-17s.  Therefore, the Army should limit purchases and reduce research and development expenditures.  In response to this ruling, Spalding revised the fiscal year 1940 acquisition program to divert all funding from four-engine bomber programs to two-engine bombers.433 This step finally got the Chief of the Air Corps, Oscar Westover, directly involved.  Long favoring working within the staffing process, Westover had largely avoided the fight over heavy bombers.  In a delicate response to General Craig, Westover complained that the G-4 had gone beyond even the far-reaching Joint Board study by                                                 432 Arnold, Global Mission, 176-79. 433 Memo, Spalding to Craig, 19 July 1938, AG452.1, box#2583, RG#407, National Archives.

He contended that whereas the board only recommended buying no aircraft larger than B-17s, the overzealous Spalding had used the report effectively to kill all heavy bomber acquisitions and future research.434  Westover warned this complete defunding would be irreversible once instituted.   In the end, world events soon overtook the intra-and interservice disputes over bombers and bombing.  Still, this period represented perhaps the greatest threat to strategic bomber advocates when the combination of a hostile General Staff, a Chief of Staff with different priorities, and a renewal of the old spat with the Navy seemingly spelled the doom for strategic bombing.  This might have been the end of our story except for the Munich Crisis and the start of World War II.  The Onset of World War II and the Triumph
