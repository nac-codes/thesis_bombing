avy seemingly spelled the doom for strategic bombing.  This might have been the end of our story except for the Munich Crisis and the start of World War II.  The Onset of World War II and the Triumph of Strategic Bombing The Munich Crisis of 1938 and the start of World War II breathed new life into strategic bombing.  On one level, these events generated political support for heavy bombers during a particularly dire moment.  On another, the war finally forced the issue of Air Corps doctrine.  No longer could strategic bombing remain a theoretical exercise conducted at ACTS.  With the war looming, America finally had to come to grips with its national security plan and the Air Corps had to turn theoretical papers and tactics manuals into actual plans. The Air Corps stood ready for the task with a wealth of highly experienced men ready to turn theory into doctrine.

By 1939, these officers had graduated to new staff positions in the Air Corps where they were perfectly positioned to implement the strategic bombing vision so painstakingly developed at ACTS.  Thus, when the order came down to draft the Air Corps war plan, a highly experienced and knowledgeable group of aviators stood ready to turn strategic bombing theory into a plan. Even before the European leaders reached an agreement in September 1938 on partitioning Czechoslovakia at Munich, American political leaders were starting to reevaluate air power.  With growing concerns over European developments, General Craig gave way in June 1938 when he convinced the Secretary of War to approve the addition of elev
