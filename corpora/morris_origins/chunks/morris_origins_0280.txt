ers were starting to reevaluate air power.  With growing concerns over European developments, General Craig gave way in June 1938 when he convinced the Secretary of War to approve the addition of eleven B-17s and thirty-two B-18s to the already approved 1939 acquisition program.  Perhaps more impressive, this change of heart occurred despite the General Staff’s warning to the Air Corps not to request any additional four-engine bombers in its 1939 budget.435  Just a month later, political events intervened to bring new clarity to the struggle to expand the heavy bomber forces.  On 11 July 1938, Hugh Wilson, the U. S. ambassador to Germany, cabled Roosevelt concerning the threat of Nazi Germany.  While viewing the Nazis as a threat was nothing new, Wilson’s assessment of Germany’s strength proved a turning point for American air power.

Historian Barry Posen argues the crisis caused a growing number of political leaders to see British acquiescence to German demands as largely submitting to Hitler’s air power threat.437  While it maybe a stretch to view only German air power as the reason for the concessions at Munich, future events indicated the importance of this shared vision to American air power.  On 14 November 1938, Roosevelt met with
