to prepare a study on Air Corps requirements needed for hemispheric defense.  With this guidance, Arnold’s staff worked with ACTS to develop the first draft of “A Study of Air Defense in the Western Hemisphere.”  The plan called for a bomber-heavy force consisting of 5,500 aircraft at a total cost of $550 million.440 The General Staff’s opposition to a bomber-centric air force did not completely die out just because the president changed his strategic focus.  The staff mounted an effective campaign to convince Craig that any growth should be balanced across all elements of the Army.  Therefore, Craig returned to Roosevelt with a plan that balanced the growth of the Air Corps with an expansion of the traditional combat arms and even growth in Army infrastructure. Roosevelt responded to the plan with what has become almost legendary in the annals of air power history: “America could not influence Hitler with barracks, runways, and schools.”441  What it needed and wanted was aircraft.  The drubbing of the General Staff’s plan set the tone for the next round of military appropriations.  On 12 January 1939, Roosevelt asked Congress for a $300 million Air Corps expansion to 5,500 aircraft involving the purchase of 3,251 new airplanes, including many heavy bombers.442  Congress started the next phase in the strategic bombing saga when it approved the request three months later. Three other important events in 1939 also directed the future of strategic bombing.  The first occurred in the realm of technology where Air Corps expansion                                                 439 Arnold, Global Mission, 177-80. 440 Futrell, Ideas, Concepts, and Doctrine, 87. 441 Robert Dallek, Franklin D.
