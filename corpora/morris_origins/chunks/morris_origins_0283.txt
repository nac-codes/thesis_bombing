The most important portion for strategic bombing was a report titled “Future Aeronautical Research and Development Problems.”  Completed in August 1939, the report warned that American military aviation technology had fallen behind other advanced nations, calling the inferiority “a deplorable situation that could not be tolerated.”443  It castigated the Air Corps for having no defensive turrets on either the B-17 or B-24 bomber, while also questioning why neither aircraft had more than rudimentary navigation or communications capabilities.444  This timely study, along with information learned from the battles of France and Britain, spurred a new round of technology development that readied American heavy bombers for their combat debut. The second event was the September 1939 appointment of Gen. George C. Marshall as the next Army Chief of Staff.  Not only did Marshall prove open to air power, but he also worked to strengthen the Air Corps organizationally.  He noted that the creation of the GHQ AF had solved some operational problems, but created confusion in the command structure.  Therefore, Marshall established a new Deputy Chief of Staff for Air in November 1939, appointing Arnold to the position.445  This new staff organization oversaw both the Chief of the Air Corps and the GHQ AF Commander, effectively creating a staff directorate to command both support and combat elements.  In doing so, Marshall alleviated much of the personnel and budgetary conflicts between the two elements while also setting the stage for the creation of the Army Air Forces on 20 June 1941.  This new Army element combined the GHQ AF and Air Corps into one                                                 443 “ESMR No. 50-41-351: Future Aeronautical Research and Development Problems,” 18 August 1939, Call#204-
