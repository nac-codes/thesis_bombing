From the start, German airplanes appeared to rule the skies, bringing destruction and terror to European industries and cities.  Lt. Col. Donald Wilson, now the director of the Department of Air Tactics at ACTS, even wrote, “He (Hitler) is our greatest booster, without even so much as a request from us he has voluntarily undertaken the job of demonstrating our theories.”447  This initial view of the war seemed to reinforce the American vision of using strategic bombers to disrupt an enemy’s infrastructure unopposed by aerial defenses.

Yet, the Germans failed to knock out the British.
