olored by preconceived notions and shaped by an already accepted American aviation doctrine.448  Therefore, two general explanations for the German defeat appeared in most of the Air Corps assessments of the Battle of Britain.  The first reflected the opinion that the Luftwaffe failed because it was                                                 446 Haywood S.

The second was an even more dangerous assessment that the Germans lost because they had a poor understanding of strategic airpower and that the defeat was not due to British defenses.  Maj. Gen. James E. Cheney summed up this line of thinking in a 5 September 1941 letter that ascribed the Luftwaffe’s failure to German errors and not because of inherent problems with strategic bombing theory.449 In this way, the American airmen were able to pick and choose the situation that best suited their own needs without challenging their base assumptions.  This helped in the near term to build a stronger air force and an initial strategic plan.  Yet, in the long run the approach led to the failure to identify important flaws in their own theory.  For instance, correctly understanding the role of the British integrated air defense in stopping the Luftwaffe might have shed light on American problems such as the lack of a long-range escort fighter to aid the bombers in penetrating a similar German air defense structure. While these major events in 1939 and early 1940 created the organizational structure, technological basis, and political support to bring strateg
