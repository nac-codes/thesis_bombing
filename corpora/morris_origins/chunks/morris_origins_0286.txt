in penetrating a similar German air defense structure. While these major events in 1939 and early 1940 created the organizational structure, technological basis, and political support to bring strategic bombing to fruition, one factor still remained.  The Air Corps needed a working plan for how to implement its theory.  For too long it had approached strategic bombing through only a theoretical lens.  Now with war looming on the horizon, there was a desperate need to turn the theoretical into the practical. The catalyst for developing a formal aerial doctrine occurred on 9 July 1941 when Roosevelt requested a production plan for the military assets needed for a possible war with Germany.  The first step in determining how many aircraft American industry                                                 449 Greer, Development of Air Doctrine, 117.

Once this was accomplished, the Army could then establish what types of aircraft and how many of each it needed.  Because the Army’s operational planners were busy developing overarching war plans, this task fell to the Air War Plans Division of the Air Corps staff. The Air War Plans Division was uniquely suited for such an endeavor.  While it had only four officers assigned to it at the start of the planning process, they were key figures in the development of strategic bombing theory.  The division chief, Lt. Col. Harold L. George, had served as both a student and instructor at ACTS from 1931 to 1935, including two years as the chief of the Department of Air Strategy and Tactics.  His staff of Lt. Col. Orvil Anderson, Lt. Col. Kenneth Walker, and Maj. Haywood S. Hansell had also all been associated with ACTS, even becoming identified with the group of instructors known as the “Bomber Mafia” for their vocal support of strategic bombing.  To this team, George added Lt. Cols
