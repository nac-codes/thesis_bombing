Cols. Max F. Schneider and Arthur W. Vanaman, and Majors Hoyt S. Vandenberg, Laurence S. Kuter, and Samuel E. Anderson.  All but Anderson had passed through ACTS during the ascension of strategic bombing theory.450 This combined background allowed the officers to complete the plan, AWPD-1, in just nine days ending on 12 August.  Comprised of three equal parts, AWPD-1 went far beyond a production numbers drill to become a comprehensive plan for the defeat of Germany.  First, the plan included a strategic air campaign to destroy German war-making industry. Next, AWPD-1 contained an air superiority component to restrain German air operations.  Finally, the scheme included a ground support element to ensure                                                 450 Donald L.

Not surprisingly, the strategic air campaign portion of the plan closely followed the tenets so familiar to its authors from their time at ACTS.  It implemented Wilson’s Industrial Web Theory, even identifying 154 individual targets in the electrical, transportation, oil, and aircraft production industries that it concluded would “virtually destroy the source of military strength of the German state.”452  The plan ended by estimating the force needed to meet all three military objectives.  As might be expected, AWPD-1 called for a bomber force comprised of ten groups of medium bombers, twenty groups of heavy bombers, and twenty-four g
