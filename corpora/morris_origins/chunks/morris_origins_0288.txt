force needed to meet all three military objectives.  As might be expected, AWPD-1 called for a bomber force comprised of ten groups of medium bombers, twenty groups of heavy bombers, and twenty-four groups of super-heavy bombers. Thus, the creation of AWPD-1 can be seen as the coming full circle of air power thought and strategy from World War I.  America entered the Great War with a poorly prepared air force.  The questions of what types of aircraft the air service needed, how many of each, and how best to use them largely evolved from French and British suggestions or trial and error during combat.  These lessons sank deep into the American aviatorsâ€™ psyche, prodding them to use the succeeding two decades to explore military aviation organization, technology, and doctrine.  In AWPD-1 they finally had a plan that started with a strategy and then figured out organizational and technological questions based on implementing the plan.  With AWPD-1 completed, American strategic bombing was now ready for its moment in the sun.                                                  451 AWPD-1, Munitions Requirements of the Army Air Forces to Defeat our Potential Enemies, 12 August 1941, Chapter 2, Sec 1, Part 3, Call#145.82.1, IRIS#00118160, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL. 452 Ibid., tab 1, 1-2.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 271 --- 265 Conclusion The era from 1934 to 1941 represents a nice bookend for the birth and early development of American strategic bombing theory.  If viewed as a human lifespan, strategic bombing went through its adolescence during those critical years.  It was no longer a new idea, nor was it in the early development stages.  By the second half of the 1930s, strategic bombing theory was starting to take its adult form with the attachment of high-attitude day light bombing, precision, and industrial web theory to heavy bombers in the writings of ACTS students and instructors.  Still, much like a human faces tremendous challenges during his or her transi
