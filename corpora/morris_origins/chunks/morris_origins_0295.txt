budgets never saw the drastic cuts that other military branches felt.  Similarly, it is hard to prove progressivism had anything but a minor effect on the mindsets of military planners in ways that may or may not have affected their theories.  Hence, as with the other factors, there is a mixture of correlation and disconnection between these forces and the destiny of strategic bombing.  So, what does explain the success of strategic bombing theory?  The simple answer is that there is no simple answer.  Instead, the complex interaction among these disparate forces that pushed and pulled American air power towards long-range strategic  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 278 --- 272 bombing.  This process evolved in several steps starting with the invention of the airplane and ending with the approval of AWPD-1.  In some ways, the origins of strategic bombing started with the Wright brothers’ first flight in 1903.  This technological leap not only made modern military aviation possible, but it also stimulated thinking about how to use the aerial domain in warfare.  Still, it was the use of the fledgling technology in combat, first in Mexico and then in France, that truly turned the United States Army towards new ideas about air power.  Raynal Bolling, Edgar Gorrell, and Billy Mitchell all played roles in shaping the early debate concerning the use of air power.  These men were not alone, though; they learned from and incorporated the earlier work of Allied airmen like Caproni, Tiverton, Grey, and Trenchard.  In this way, key individuals transformed the early technology into a potentially devastating, but not decisive, new type of warfare.   Air power’s path to supremacy was not that simple.  The new idea faced organizational, political, and technological complications that prevented its full adoption by the eve of World War II.  First, an Army resistant to change limited independent long-range bombing operations.  Next, political exigencies hampered the use of avia
