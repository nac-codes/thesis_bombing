the New York Times Vows section. The death by drone of a terrorist at the wedding half a world away would appear on the front page. But now imagine that nobody dies at the Afghan ceremony, though the nuptials are nevertheless punctuated by the macabre boom of a drone strike bringing justice on impact to a confirmed militant a mile away. The guests in the tent eat their meal not only relieved that the United States has stopped bombing weddings so frequently (which it has), but also painfully aware that they are subject to a new kind of rule. It still matters that their sky is not quite without blemish, and that they still hear booms. In a few years, other machines may inspire a similar disquiet. So-called autonomous weapons systems- robot warriors-may hold quarries for capture. Meanwhile, U.S. Spe- cial Forces may operate as a kind of global police, one that kills only when it faces too much resistance after inviting surrender. In our time, swords have not been beaten into plowshares. They have been melted down for drones. Yet for all their faults, it is also | 5 | true that drones are increasingly the cleanest mode of war ever con- ceived. They hover nearby and, when they attack, do so with pains- taking real-time targeting in the name of precision and thus civilian care. Indeed, drones are symbolic of the fact that the United States made a clear choice to make war more humane-an imperative shaped by intense, sustained pressure from diverse communities of activists and armed forces, with an eye on the acceptability of violence for different audiences. That imperative also affects emerging forms of cyberwarfare and the Special Forces that operated in more than three- quarters of the countries on the planet in a recent year (even if only to pass through on the way to their ultimate destination). Sometimes the choice to wage humane war is for the sake of ethics, sometimes it is for optics, and often it is both. It is never a matter of technological possibility alone.
