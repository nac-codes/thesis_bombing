YOUNG AMERICAN, MY COUNTRY WENT TO WAR AGAIN. I was working in the White House, as a lowly intern, when NATO |7| bombed Serbia to prevent mass killings in Kosovo. The interven- tion looked like the final violence necessary to put right a globe that had been disfigured by the necessities of the Cold War but was now on the brink of peace. I supported it. Only later did it seem the early stages of something altogether unexpected-and for many unintended. It has come to be called America's "endless war," es- pecially as the campaigns against global terror after September 11, 2001, started off and ground on. Looking back from our vantage point, it can appear that U.S. war was always endless, starting with the Cold War or World War II before it or violence at home and abroad as the country pushed to its current frontiers and explored imperial spaces beyond.

For one thing, it was legitimate in 1989 to expect a different path. The United Nations had promised a world of free and equal peoples; with the superpower competition ended, why shouldn't that promise now be fulfilled? For another, as time passed it seemed like the main con- cerns Americans expressed about their wars were changing.

And I wondered: When and how had those standards become relevant in the first place? To understand these developments struck me as crucial-and not just for reckoning with our past. We had made a mo
