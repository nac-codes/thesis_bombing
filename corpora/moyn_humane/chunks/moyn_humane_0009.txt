the occasional possibility that war emancipates and liberates while still worrying that America's recent wars fail to achieve success while leading to less freedom than subjugation, and in a chilling new guise. At some point, today's deterritorialized and endless war may mutate into an unprecedented new system: rule and surveillance by one or several powers across an astonishingly large arc of the world's surface, pa- trolled by armed drones or paid visits by the Special Forces acting as quasi-permanent military police. Indeed, even if barely foreseeable today, our time has brought into view a possibility that we might greet with relief if it were not so unsettling, too: a future of war be- yond killing.

Would it be better or worse if global Amer- ican war became global American policing, with killing not the core of the practice but a regrettable exception? To pose such questions, it is essential to combine histories usually  HUMANE PROLOGUE kept apart. One is about how expectations and rules for peace instead of war developed; the other is about the development of rules for humane conduct within hostilities when they break out. These two histories are mostly separated, on the grounds that rules for more hu- mane war should apply regardless of the moral and legal justification of a war itself.
