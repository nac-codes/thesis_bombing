the millennialist Christian idea that war might end on this earth. They led the effort to impose international limits on making war. From the beginning, however, there was lively debate about how that ambition fit together with the noble goal of making war more humane. Those worries were, in fact, more lively in the nineteenth century when it was novel to pursue peace and humanity, and the ragtag advocates of each agenda sometimes worked together even as they wondered if one goal threatened the other. For more than a century, however, suspicions that the pursuit of humane war could postpone peace were entirely abstract. War was too brutal, and early laws to govern it did not aim to make it more humane. In 1945, the United Nations Charter, which the United States did the most to draft, prohibited force-and therefore most wars-with only narrow exceptions. At the Nuremberg trials, the country took the lead in charging Adolf Hitler's henchmen with "aggression." Yet as the United States crossed the Rubicon in the mid-twentieth cen- tury to become the guarantor of global order, it began fighting wars in many more places than before. As it did so, America's worldwide presence became as brutal as the imperial history from which the country itself emerged. For a while after 1945, the whole world be- came "Indian country" as the United States exported homegrown violence and adapted the no-holds-barred practices such as geno- cide and torture refined over centuries by European empires fight- | 11 | ing counterinsurgent small wars or conventional big ones.

The United States preserved order in part of the world after 1945-but did so in a way that postponed the coming of humane war. Yet even as Americans began to fight brutally in more and more places after World War II, their country's ascendancy occurred in a novel time. It was now less and less allowable (or at least feasible) to exclude the b
