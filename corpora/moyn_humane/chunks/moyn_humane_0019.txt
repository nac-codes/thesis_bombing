y proponents of a peace mobilization-Tolstoy not least- pacifism followed simply from taking Christianity seriously. A few transatlantic sects, such as Anabaptists, Mennonites, and Quakers, had for centuries understood refusal to take up arms as part of their faith. They were right to think that Jesus's message had less to do with making war humane than with turning the other cheek. | 21| In the nineteenth century, Christian pacifism boomed. The Amer- ican seer William Lloyd Garrison, the devout abolitionist who cam- paigned against slavery, had war in his sights, too. The Massachusetts senator and radical Republican Charles Sumner condemned the "war system of the commonwealth of nations" in 1845, as the country's invasion of Mexico was brewing. It was probably the most influential antiwar speech in U.S. history. Then there was Adin Ballou, whom Tolstoy would come to admire even more. Born in 1803 in Rhode Island, Ballou converted to pacifism in 1838. An austere Christian minister, he founded the utopian community of Hopedale, Massa- chusetts, and crisscrossed New England to preach peace (as well as abolition, socialism, and temperance). Unlike Garrison-who publicly announced that his antislavery campaign trumped his nonviolent creed when John Brown raided Harper's Ferry in 1857-Ballou re- fused in the Civil War to give "allegiance to the war god when with his battle-axe he cleft asunder the fetters of the slave." Most onetime American pacifists-like Sumner-followed Garrison's lead in the crisis. But after the destruction of slavery, American peace movements would surge again. As the nineteenth century passed, secular radicals and later lib- erals joined the mix, alongside Christian pacifists. One of the lead- ing ideologues of eternal peace in the second half of the nineteenth century was the Englishman William Cobden, who insisted that free trade could someday unify humanity where Christianity had graph- ically failed to do so.
