ay have been accidental that Swiss gentlemen captured the cause when they founded the Red Cross in the 1860s, and that as a result Geneva remains to this day the city most associated with making warfare more humane. Still, after their own minor civil war in 1847, the Swiss had fewer other problems to solve and low levels of political conflict by comparison with other countries. A cipher named Henry Dunant was in the right place at the right time to give Swiss gentlemen a high international task. A pious Calvinist, he had restricted his moral engagements as a youth to familiar causes such as relief for the poor and support for orphans, and all on a local scale.

Describing himself as a "tourist," he narrated the battle (which he had not witnessed) before turning to the aftermath, with bodies alive and dead strewn over more than twelve miles of countryside.
