But Dunant's most influential pages were reserved for how badly organized was the care for the wounded. Stricken fighters were abandoned as gangrene and infection set in, or if they healed in unsanitary conditions guaranteed to lead to the same re- sults. "Their faces black with flies that buzzed around their wounds, they looked every which way for help that no one gave." The depiction of such harrowing scenes had invited a variety of responses before, from grim acceptance of God's inscrutable justice, to Francisco Goya's mockery of the human folly of Napoleon's coun- terinsurgency in his country.

The celebrated French literary critics Edmond and Jules de Goncourt, after overpraising Dunant's writing as "better, a thousand times better, than Homer," concluded that it was an antiwar tract in effect if not in intent.
