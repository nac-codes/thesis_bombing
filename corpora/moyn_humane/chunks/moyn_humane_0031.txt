clash of military forces. Famously, in War and Peace Tolstoy wanted to smash the Clausewitzian mythol- ogy of Napoleon and with it the whole idea that war was amenable to intentional control. As for theorizing about battle at windy alti- tudes, Tolstoy found it ridiculous, and Clausewitz trots through his scene to imply as much. Yet Tolstoy also has Clausewitz, in addi- tion to delivering a disastrous plan for the next day's battle, defend brutality, too: "The only aim is to weaken the enemy," Clausewitz | 31| remarks from his saddle (in German in the Russian novel), "so one cannot, of course, take into account the losses of private persons." In his dream of not taking prisoners, Tolstoy's character ironically sounded a Clausewitzian note. What Prince Andrei was suggesting in his speech was that intensification would lead to more humanity and less suffering over time for all its brutality in the short run- precisely because it would lead to more peace. Not taking prisoners "by itself would change the whole war and make it less cruel," An- drei says. If Clausewitz was right that intensity led indirectly to pacification, intensification also turned out to be more humane than humanization! On its own, paradoxically, humanization could foment more war, and less humane outcomes. Furthermore, Andrei insisted, making war more humane could lead war to be an easier matter to start: a less fateful and momentous choice, because the stakes were lower. "If there was none of this magnanimity in war," he continued in his impassioned homily, "we should go to war only when it was worthwhile going to certain death." When audiences shrank from the argument that intense wars were good in themselves, advocates of intensification offered blind guesses about the future. It wasn't just that bloody wars would be- come less routine. They also suggested that shock and awe would end more quickly once it started. As Lieber forecast, "intense wars are of short duration." Yet advocates of making
