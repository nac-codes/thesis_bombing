But Aylmer Maude, his biographer and friend, was absolutely right that the speech anticipated Tolstoy's mature at- tack on "humanity" in warfare on pacifist grounds, "like the light- ning of a coming storm." For Andrei's main commitment is not to prediction but to truth and the risks of suppressing it. Prettification of evil is quite simply prevarication, and it could lead people to com- promise with it. "Get rid of falsehood," Andrei counsels, "and let war be war," "the most horrible thing in life." Soon Tolstoy devoted most of his energy to the different proposition that making war hu- mane could court the risk of endless war, and above all cover up its horrors. It is the way he did so that applies to our own situation, as we endure the forever if occasionally more humane war of our time.

From his deathbed in 1883, Ivan Turgenev begged Tolstoy to return to his better talent. Even Tolstoy's earlier
