reasoning," the philosopher Bertrand Russell remarked contemptu- ously. Tolstoy's own biographer chastised him for becoming a "de- nouncer of obvious evils in an obvious way," deeming his pacifist outpourings "simplistic." Intending to save him from a century's worth of knowing verdicts, the craggy-faced Oxford don Isaiah Berlin repeated such criticisms when he called Tolstoy a fox who was confused about who he really was and tried to be a hedgehog instead. In debates around Tolstoy's legacy, however, it has never been noted that he was concerned in pioneering and still-pertinent ways with how legally humanizing vile practices risked entrenching them. It did so in two fundamental ways. First, reformers came to tolerate an enduring evil when they chose to make it more humane. Second, their audiences risked fooling themselves: they came to be- lieve that striking a blow against the cruelty of a practice made their continuing involvement in it noble. Call the first the advocate's com- |37| promise and the second the beneficiary's bad faith. It is even possi- ble that nothing of Tolstoy's self-made religion survives except his astute and prophetic attempt-a small part of his grandiose if not megalomaniacal undertaking to finally save the world from sin-to denounce the contradictions and risks of humane war. PRINCE ANDREI'S ARGUMENTS IN WAR AND PEACE NO LONGER MADE sense, by the converted Tolstoy's lights. Those arguments had re- volved around the likely consequences of humanizing or intensi- fying a conflict, speculating that the one would worsen outcomes where the other might improve them. The later Tolstoy's most inspired move was to develop a compar- ison of humane war to the more obvious evils of humanizing other violent corporal practices. He started by recalling the example of chattel slavery, charging that making it more humane had been a gross moral error. What if reformers humanized an institution they could and should have eradicated? Not that Tolstoy's outra
