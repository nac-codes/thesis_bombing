In- deed, the West Indies retained a reputation for cruelty and mortality to the end of enslavement while the United States took humanization to the hilt. As a result of its own sense of Enlightenment and moder- nity, the slaveholding class adopted a sometimes fervent principle  HUMANE | 40 | THE WARNING of humanity that dictated treating their chattel less cruelly though never equally.

Just as early humane societies did not threaten the right to own pets, slave owners did not see the slightest contradiction between new limits to what they could do to their property and their eternal right to own it. Though struggling with each other, humanitarians and slaveholders shared the same goal: humane slavery.

Occasionally they entertained the hope that the humanization of slavery would lead to its eradication- precisely the perspective that Moynier was to take, decades later, to- ward war. Was there a case to be made that transforming slavery in a more humane direction could or did prepare onetime advocates of the practice to become its enemies? Perhaps.
