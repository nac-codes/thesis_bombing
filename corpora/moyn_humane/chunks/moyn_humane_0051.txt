(Tolstoy later helped fund the mass exodus of the Dukhobors to Canada.) But his refusal of com- promise with states struck many who shared his goals as pointless. If there was any opportunity to make states take war off the table in their dealings with one another, why not seize it? The perfect could not rule out the good.

He criticized Suttner for taking Nobel's money. When he passed away, she nonetheless praised him as "a high priest" of her cause. Yet her version of their religion involved chasing a lot of birds with salt.
