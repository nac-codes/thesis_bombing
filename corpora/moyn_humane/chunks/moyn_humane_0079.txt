various flowers had sprouted from its grave. Outside the League, in an in- strument negotiated among Europeans at the Swiss lake town of Lo- carno in 1925, Germany's border with its western neighbors was set, with Britain promising to guarantee it against alteration or incursion  HUMANE 1721 BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS by either side. The agreement was the high point of optimism for European peace. It left much undone, including arms reduction and the status of Germany's eastern borders. And even at this bright mo- ment, the continuation of the sorts of alliance blocs that had brought about World War I threatened disputes, and so were a bad omen of a darker future. Most significant, leading powers replaced arbitration with a sys- tem of collective security under international law that allowed for identifying aggressors and policing them for the sake of peace- what the United Nations does, in theory, to this very day. This func- tional replacement for arbitration rose through a brilliant exercise in rebranding known as the "outlawry of war" proposal. It resurrected a binding scheme for peace among states from its grave but made it political rather than judicial. It worked by proposing to federate states in a League powerful enough to deal with rowdy members when they arose. A jury of the states themselves, rather than inde- pendent judges, would pass a verdict on warmongers and stop them. Not only would this outlawry plan require the United States to step up, but also it would demand the abandonment of the idea that a state could be neutral toward aggression elsewhere. Either the world got together to keep the peace, combining forces against aggressive states that interrupted it, or war would continue forever. "Voluntary methods are doubtless most important in preserving domestic peace, nevertheless, states also use coercive methods," Wright explained in 1925. The only solution was to establish enough governance inter- nationally to define wrongdoing and police it-j
