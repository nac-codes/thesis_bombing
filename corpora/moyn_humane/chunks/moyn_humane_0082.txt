the hype understood that the treaty's true meaning was not the immediate victory of peace. Instead, it anticipated the par- amount responsibility of the United States in advancing that cause. "The historical significance of this treaty, if it can still be said ever to have possessed any," one wise observer of the situation remarked, "resided exclusively in the association of the United States in the campaign for the maintenance of peace." Capitalizing on its victory at The Hague a generation before, the United States insisted that nothing done pursuant to the Monroe Doc- trine could in principle qualify as a violation. Kellogg told the Senate that the treaty did not forbid self-defense, which extended to "any in- terests or rights the United States may have." In response to the United States conditioning its signature on its birthright of hemispheric in- tervention, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and El Salvador all refused to sign. The British foreign secretary, Austen Chamberlain, was not to be outdone in brazenly reducing the treaty to meaninglessness. He had won the Nobel Peace Prize only three years before for negotiating the Locarno treaty (his more notorious half brother, Neville, would serve as appeasement prime minister in the next decade). Now Chamber- lain reserved his nation's right not simply to defend itself but also to deploy armed force in "self-defense" wherever the British Empire's interests were at stake-which is to say, anywhere.

By the 1920s, Americans who had refused to join the League itself were willing to join in hallowing European peace rhetorically. The outlawry of war became completely mainstream
