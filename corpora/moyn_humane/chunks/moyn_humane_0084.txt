The only question remaining in the face of bad behav- ior by another was: "What will the United States do about it?" THIS WAS NO MERELY HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION, FOR HITLER ROSE TO power in Germany three years later. Even before, Wright had cause for encouragement when the Re- publican Henry Stimson, a Wall Street lawyer and Herbert Hoover's secretary of state, responded to Japanese "aggression" in invading Manchuria in 1931 by saying the United States would not recognize this brazen act of colonialism as lawful. Stimson's announcement, Wright celebrated, "is likely to go down in history as of greater significance in the development of international law" than any other "of recent or even more distant years." International law had once "converted violence into legality, robbery into title, might into right." The idea that it would consecrate peace instead was not new in content but had suddenly moved from books into practice. Of course, this didn't solve the real problem. Somebody would have to boot Japan out rather than deem its annexation illegal alone. That the United States now withheld recognition from the fruits of some- one else's war hardly meant it was committing to keep the peace. Wright knew, of course, that reinterpreting words was not the same as inciting deeds. The question remained: Would the United States step up to guarantee eternal peace after its missed opportu- nity when World War I ended?
