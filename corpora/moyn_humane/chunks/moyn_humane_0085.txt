put down any newly recognized aggression-or even lead the way in doing so? "The col- lective system for preserving peace, which has developed in spite of the initial abstention of the United States," Wright noted in 1933, "has received rude blows during the past year and its fate may in a large measure depend on the attitude of the United States." Skeptics, like the elderly then-dean of American international lawyers, John Bassett Moore, felt it was not a good idea for their country to renounce its birthright in exchange for the pottage of end- less war to keep other countries from fighting one another. The low dishonest decade of the 1930s convinced most Americans that, with Europeans at one another's throats again, Wilsonianism had been catastrophic and global entanglements were not a dream but a ruse. Wright replied that the world had changed, as ultimate American entry in World War I already proved. Why not arrest the coming of faraway unwanted conflict early rather than get swept in again? "If it is practically certain that we will become involved in any war between great powers which lasts for a considerable length of time, whatever we do," he observed in 1935, "then a policy of co-operation to prevent war could add little to the risk." Unfortunately for an internationalist vision of peace, not many Americans were buying it. Suttner, dead twenty years, had left a bequest in the form of a new ideal but without any guarantee of its realization. Now the next terrible blow to that dream-World War II-was on the way. Had Suttner lived in vain? Had Wright wasted his time? War remained endemic, or even worsening, its brutality increasing along with its frequency. It was hard to take seriously Tolstoy's warning that making warfare humane could post- pone peace-yet.  CHAPTER THREE Laws of Inhumanity IT WAS AN OUTRAGE. WHEN BERTHA VON SUTTNER LEARNED THAT HENRY Dunant might win the first Nobel Peace Prize for the year 1901, she sprang into action. Why was the founder of
