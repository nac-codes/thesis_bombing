ofoundly racialized. Colonial war was forced into a nether zone of asymmetrical if sometimes conventional conflict, counterinsurgent suppression to restore order, and imperial provisions licensing emer- gency measures and martial law. In all these versions of global fighting, rules were even less significant a constraint than on the transatlan- tic scene. One reason humanitarians and peace advocates alike gained more traction when it came to great-power conflict across borders was that few people found anything wrong with counterinsurgency-the suppression of the irregular forces of enemies-within empires. It was hardly by accident that international law regulated war between states, not within colonies. As a result, the "progress" that the cam- paign for humane war embodied did not interfere with the global designs of states. Counterinsurgent war also had a North Atlantic history, and it showed that a second set of standards also applied to white ene- mies when they failed to fight with an organized army. Breakaway Americans facing down the British Empire in the 1770s, like the doomed 1790s insurgents in the Vend√©e suppressed by the leaders of the French Revolution, had certainly used irregular tactics to fight better-armed or more numerous foes. But it required Napoleon's mass armies and new modes of organization for a second track of counterinsurgent warfare to emerge clearly in response to his rag- tag opponents.

A century of counterinsurgent "small wars" followed around the world. A border war in
