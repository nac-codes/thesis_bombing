and Peace remarks of the scene, with a blend of dread and snark, "as if there were any rules for killing people." A century of counterinsurgent "small wars" followed around the world. A border war in America between bushwhackers and jayhawks-as irregular forces contending with each other in Kansas and Missouri before and during the Civil War were known-and the Franco-Prussian War five years later showed that not all counterin- surgencies were in faraway colonies. But most were standoffs of white empires against nonwhite foes. As a result, militaries developed- most famously in the British colonel C. E. Callwell's manual for small wars-counterinsurgency theory for global violence that they would apply into the twentieth century. Asymmetry, unlike counterinsurgency, went back in time as far as anyone could study. Lopsided conflicts were routine in the co- lonial wars of conquest and control that raged the world over from the fifteenth through the twentieth centuries, with vanishingly rare non-European victories. In 1896, Ethiopia decisively won the battle of Adwa against Italy, fielding a force that may have topped 100,000 rifle-bearing and often horse-borne soldiers, crushing the smaller Ital- ian army. But far more often, the arrestingly total victories were of the West over the rest. For example, consider the long-running "Dervish wars" in the Sudan. A two-decades-long counterinsurgency against the Mahdi, a Muslim rebel leader, climaxed in the extraordinary Battle of Omdur- man on September 2, 1898. There, more than 50,000 Africans armed with swords and spears-with some of the emirs leading them wear- ing chain-mail armor-faced the famed Victorian soldier Herbert  HUMANE | 94| | 95 | LAWS OF INHUMANITY Kitchener's riflemen. When the fighting started at dawn, none of the opponents of the British could get within a half mile of their lines before being mowed down. By the end of the morning, the Dervishes had lost half of their forces, while Kitchener reported a mere
