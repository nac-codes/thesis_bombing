Unlike the usual impe- rial enterprises, in which the national interest inevitably got mixed up with the "tutelary" one, Leopold's personal rubber colony in the Congo, Moynier believed, could become a model of bringing Christianity and civilization where it was lacking. Yet at the apogee of European empire, even greater horror followed in the Congo than elsewhere. Secretly, and for a long time, Leopold's henchmen amputated arms and hands of na- tive workers when rubber quotas were not met, and what historians now estimate to be as many as ten million deaths took place.

The self-styled civilized "have not recognized in those they call barbarians the right of belligerents," Hornung protested, to say nothing of according them the protections under law that might have followed. It will not do, of course, to homogenize European military ac- tion around the world and over several centuries into a picture of complete disregard for all moral and legal constraints on using force against nonwhite people.
