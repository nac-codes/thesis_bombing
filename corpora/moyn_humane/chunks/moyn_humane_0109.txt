do. He was present as Roberts-victor of the Afghan War-waged a successful imperial war as the first year of the new century began. But Rob- erts's campaign was harsh in the extreme. The overwhelming force he deployed-400,000 men-meant that he quickly won the conven- tional battles for the cities of his enemies, forcing Boer political and military leaders into hiding. What followed for the next two years, un- der Roberts's assistant, then successor, Kitchener, was a vicious con- test across the veldt as organized British forces pursued Boers fighting elusively in small bands. It was a counterinsurgency that resembled many asymmetrical partisan wars before and since, with the familiar difficulties of finding and identifying military enemies and suppress- ing them amid an opaque and unfriendly rural population. Doyle left by July 1900, and Roberts not long after. The cam- paign against Boer guerrillas and snipers had already begun. The escalating controversy about Kitchener's tactics became so white-hot on Doyle's return to Britain that he put his talents at the service of his empire in a new way. For all but a few "pro-Boers" and peace activists in London, it was acceptable that the British treated their enemies unsparingly in the asymmetrical conflicts of the South Af- rican veldt. Internationally, including in the United States, where sympathy with the Boer republicans prevailed, outrage at British tactics was intense. With Afrikaner farms burned and their farm- ers rounded up and put in some of the world's first concentration camps, and then a no-holds-barred counterinsurgency, Doyle under- stood that the morality of the war-at least among white people- required comment. Doyle insisted that the British had been driven unwillingly into the conflict, yet even so, had gone on "to wage it with humanity." The | 99| world did not see the affair the same way. Leaders of the peace move- ment, including Suttner and Tolstoy, inveighed against the outbreak of the Boer War. N
