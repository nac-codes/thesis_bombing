British violations of the new international laws of land warfare. A breakthrough speech by the opposition Liberal Party leader, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, in June 1901 denounced "methods of barba- rism" in the field-reviewing many outrageous tactics that shamed the self-styled magnanimity of the British public. It was less revealing that Doyle's views proved more popular than Stead's than that neither thought Black lives mattered. Part of the reason for Doyle's confidence in the face of the affecting stories told  HUMANE | 100 | LAWS OF INHUMANITY by critics of the war (most of which he dismissed as propaganda) was that the bar for fighting counterinsurgent war humanely was low in the first place. Indeed, Doyle insisted as much right from the start, to set expectations properly. "When a nation adopts guerilla tactics it deliberately courts those sufferings to the whole country which such tactics invariably entail," Doyle began. "They have been the same in all wars and at all times. The army which is stung by gueril- las strikes round it furiously and occasionally indiscriminately." As a matter of fact, Boer civilians themselves celebrated the gentlemanly humanity of British soldiers. That Boer soldiers were interned at all, Doyle insisted, was proof of British humanity, in spite of trouble- some obligations in the new Hague treaty to require quarter and internment of surrendering enemies in conventional battle. The Brit- ish even went beyond the requirements, Doyle added, when they voluntarily imprisoned Boer partisans whom the Hague regulations did not protect and who had regularly been put to death as brigands in European wars through the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. Admittedly, farms had been burned in Lord Roberts's advance. The burnings continued as the counterinsurgent phase of the war kicked off.
