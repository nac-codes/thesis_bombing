More troublesome for Doyle was what was done to those white people deprived of their homes when they were put to the torch, since it had become scandalous across the world that up to 100,000 white women and children had been herded into concentration camps. Of the 28,000 who died, most were children, many of whom perished after a runaway measles outbreak.

(When challenged about Nazi practices before World War II, Hermann Goering reportedly took an encyclo- pedia from his shelf and under "concentration camps" found: "First used by the British, in the South African War.") News of the camps was undoubtedly a public relations disaster brewing. But Doyle wondered: What was the alternative?

As for the children, the fact that they perished was largely the fault of the "ignorance, perverseness, and dirty habits" of their mothers, who sometimes re- fused the ministrations of British doctors. The death lay "heavy, not upon the conscience, but upon the heart of our nation."  | 102 | LAWS OF INHUMANITY HUMANE Doyle's defensive posture anticipated a time when the public judged how warfare was conducted, even counterinsurgent war. But it mattered more that he barely mentioned the indigenous Black population because not enough of his opponents considered their treatment relevant. More than 100,000 of them had been forced into a separate camp system, and 20,000 died, most of them children. On both sides of the international struggle over the morality of the war. pro-Boer and pro-British, the treatment of Africans w
