United Kingdom had faced opponents such as William Stead, who cited chapter and verse from a new treaty calling for restraint (for white people). By contrast, the United States waged its biggest campaign outside Europe before World War II under the old Lieber Code from the Civil War, which was not replaced until 1914. The most common assumption from the start, though, was that there were no laws or customs-or that the Lieber Code offered li- cense rather than limits in counterinsurgency. The few courts-martial that did occur were exceptions that prove there were no rules or only permissive rules. With newfangled theories of race approach- ing their global apogee and older stereotypes persisting, Filipinos almost by definition could not count as honorable enemies. "Murder is almost a natural instinct with the Asiatic, who respects only the power of might," remarked Adna Chaffee, a U.S. general and Indian War veteran fresh from helping put down the Boxer Rebellion in China. "Human life all over the East is cheap. One life more or less does not matter, and it is only the fear of prompt, immediate, and unfailing punishment that holds the population in check." Chaffee would put those assumptions into practice as a military governor of the Philippines in 1901-1902. Though Lieber himself had been explicit that his rules applied regardless of color-the boundaries of the law depended on conduct-the fact that the Philippines cam- paign was a "race war" meant to most that the law of war said there were no limits.

Worse, from the early phase in and around Manila, Americans assumed that most of the people they met were hostile, and shot many without a second thought. The French minister filing reports commented mor- dantly that "American soldiers are the true savages," adding that their  HUMA
