there was an internal debate within the military about limits. There had been rhetoric from the start that not only was the situation a war, but also applicable constraints on war among civi- lized nations applied. But in practice, this verbiage took one of three forms: assurances for public consumption and legitimacy (which testifies to changing expectations if not changing war), justifications for the harshest treatment of Filipino enemies, or warnings to them to heed limits themselves or live with the consequences. Almost no evidence survives in which a legal interpretation of the Lieber Code or unwritten international law called for constraint on U.S. force or tactics. It is true that in the first, conventional phase of the war Americans captured rather than killed prisoners, though many were eventually shot. Once the counterinsurgency intensified, less radical policies were shelved as whole populations were treated as potential enemies. Doing so did not demand a new legal framework in which bandits and outlaws deserved any treatment they got. The existing one sufficed. When he succeeded MacArthur as military proconsul in July 1901, Chaffee faithfully continued the approach that lay behind the Lieber Code-intense wars were best in the long run, as they would convince restless opponents to submit and end the conflict more quickly. He escalated the policy options farther along the contin- uum of intensity, in the tradition of "Injun warfare," without ever meeting a law he didn't like.

"I want not pris- oners, I wish you to kill and burn, the more you kill and burn the better it will please me," commented General Jacob Smith, Chaffee's subordinate and another Indian War veteran, promising to reduce the area to "howling wilderness."
