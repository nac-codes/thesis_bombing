" Even so, he allowed that American "friendship" proved dif- ficult when "it was impossible to distinguish friend from foe." The hypocrisy of the statement, its pretense that the efforts in the Phil- ippines signaled a rising consciousness of the laws of war, counted for little. It is best understood as a distant anticipation of those laws centrality to U.S. politics later. The same could be said of the fact that Smith was caught up in a court-martial, receiving a light sentence before Roosevelt pardoned him altogether. After September 11, 2001, a few observers recalled that many Americans had been furious about reports of imperial violence in the Philippines a century earlier. The first to raise the alarm were Democrats backing William Jennings Bryan's pacifist candidacy in the 1900 presidential campaign.

But Bryan and his allies were less concerned with brutality of conduct than with openly stigmatizing global entangle- ments and military empire. Many of them were advocates of white American isolation rather than humane war. After Bryan's loss, an early version of a "torture debate" over the ethics of wartime infraction occurred in 1902.
