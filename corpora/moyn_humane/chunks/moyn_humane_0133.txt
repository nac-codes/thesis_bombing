cruel, as embittered, as implacable as any that has preceded it. It disregards all the restric- tions known as International Law, which in peace-time the states had bound themselves to observe." "It is more utopian to hope to make war humane than to eliminate war," one German international lawyer concluded two years later, at the depths of the carnage. In the years that followed the 1918 armistice-agreed to in the eleventh month, on the eleventh day, and at the eleventh hour of that year-it was simply no longer credible to argue that making war more humane would contribute to staving off its outbreak. How had that worked out in World War I? "In four brief years," the En- glish novelist and seer H. G.

If that was so, "all Geneva Conventions and such palliative ordinances, though excellent in intention and good in their immediate effects, make ultimately for the persistence of war  HUMANE | 118 | as an institution. They are sops to humanity, devices for rendering war barely tolerable to civilized mankind, and so staving off the in- evitable rebellion against its abominations." Another commentator was brutal about where the demand to end brutality had led: "The failure of international law," he glumly re- corded, "is due to the failure of the statesmen and jurists of the last century to use the moral forces of their day for the development of in- ternational law along the lines of true progress; and this, in turn ... is due to their preoccupation with the laws of war." If international law was to be relevant again, it would have to be a law of peace. A young Quincy Wright did not go as far as to blame humane war for endless war. But it was clear to him that if international law did not institu- tionalize peace, it was not worth much. "The war has . . . shown that international law
