far as to blame humane war for endless war. But it was clear to him that if international law did not institu- tionalize peace, it was not worth much. "The war has . . . shown that international law can not greatly reduce the destructiveness of war" he observed in 1920. If so, "the effort of international law to regu- late war" was "of slight practical value," and "international law must more seriously devote itself to the regulation of the conditions which lead to war and the elimination of war itself." World War II would have to be the war for peace that its pre- decessor had turned out not to be.

CHAPTER FOUR Air War and America's Brutal Peace WORLD PEACE THE AMERICAN WAY WAS BRUTAL WHEN ESTABLISHED IN the 1940s, and for a long time after. One of the biggest reasons was airborne weapons, which would do more than any development to make dreams of humane war incredible, even as-in our time-they would indicate the possibility of hostilities that are less cruel. Fall- ing from Prince Andrei's sky, free of the rules of warfare, the bombs that killed civilians by the millions and on purpose in World War II contributed mightily to the intensification of brutal war. They also helped bring about the establishment of a Pax Americana that has existed ever since. From the 1930s to the 1950s, Americans lived through the most transformational era in their foreign affairs. Swept into conflagra- tion after Pearl Harbor, they assumed responsibility for global affairs despite previous decades of skittish doubts. Yet the consequences of World War II were ambiguous. With America's help, European dreams of a contin
