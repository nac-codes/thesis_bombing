Christian Europeans were finally pacified and the Japanese bombed into surrender, but there was still an unimaginable amount of work to do. Alongside the new rules of peace propounded by the fledgling United Nations, the Geneva Conventions of 1949 produced a new international law for regulating hostilities just as the Cold War dawned. The laws of war, however, remained as irrelevant as ever, especially when it came to U.S. air power. Humanized versions of war were not yet a sacred duty. Five years after he arrived in Japan, MacArthur made a fateful decision to break the new rules of peace. In the dreadful winter of 1950, he made the rash choice to send troops across the 38th parallel. In response, Communist troops streamed over the Yalu River, which divided Mao Zedong's China from the Korean Peninsula, prompting MacArthur to let U.S. air power off its leash. Amid the greatest ideo- logical struggle in world history, the new peace in Europe would depend on a lot of war outside Europe. And global American bellig- erency would remain inhumane for a long time to come. IN THE 1930S AMERICANS CONDUCTED A "GREAT DEBATE" ABOUT THEIR country's global role. Both sides stood for a kind of peace. Those who came to be dismissed and reviled as "isolationists" believed in maintaining hemispheric security, coupled with neutrality toward the wars of the great European powers.

Self-styled internationalists, meanwhile, insisted that America had to commit to a globalized peace scheme. It would only emerge slowly that this option meant committing the country to global war. At this critical moment, Quincy Wright began ruminating on the consequences of the fall of the comparatively peaceful British ascendancy: "The
