this option meant committing the country to global war. At this critical moment, Quincy Wright began ruminating on the consequences of the fall of the comparatively peaceful British ascendancy: "The pax Britannica had given Europe the best two centuries it had had-at least since the pax Romana a millennium and a half earlier." It was a long-established fact: empires brought peace, too. "The excessively brutal civil and imperial wars which characterized the last century of the Roman Republic were followed by such a will to peace that most of the western world submitted to the Pax Romana of Augustus and his successors for two centuries," Wright mused. Could the twentieth century offer something similar, he wondered, without requiring the humiliating subjugation of vas- sals and ceaseless violence at the savage frontiers of empire?
