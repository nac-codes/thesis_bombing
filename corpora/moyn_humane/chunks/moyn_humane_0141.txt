The limited but real use of bombs from the skies in World War I was widely understood to be a dry run for a future age of air power. Aviators had had only a short time to prepare, and the logistical dif- ficulties of dropping bombs from dirigibles and planes were almost insurmountable. A few frightening runs in the sky were all that the European powers conducted against one another-but enough to convince everyone below that if World War I did not end all wars, the future would be terrible. Air attacks in "the present war," The New York Times reported in 1914, "violate no law, however much that might offend the world's sense of humanity." Although the fifty Zeppelin raids over Britain in 1915-16 and twenty-five plane sorties in 1917-18 caused little damage, they were portents of the nature of future war that everyone could read. While Europeans struggled to end war with one another, new practices of "strategic bombing" to sap the morale of populations were used with abandon in Europe's colonies. Following its use in North Africa, air control became a fashionable means of pacifying re- sistance across the colonial world. In World War I, the British used it on India's Northwest Frontier in 1915, where Pathans were bombed, then in Darfur and Egypt in 1916.

The planes singed him while killing his entourage on the first strike and eventually drove him into the wasteland, where he would die of influenza months later.
