own in Iraq (the part of the former Ottoman Empire given as spoils to the victorious British after World War I). Arthur "Bomber" Harris, later the hero of Britain's destruc- tion of German cities in World War II, earned his wings there. He boasted that no Iraqi enemies would resist if they knew their forces would be "practically wiped out" and "a third" of nearby villagers "killed or injured by four or five machines which offer them no real target, no opportunity for glory as warriors, no effective means of escape." The bombing of peoples who were usually imagined as "deserving" such treatment replaced more costly and older armed expeditions across forbidding landscapes. As in other kinds of coun- terinsurgency, the targets were of a different race and religion, and they either posed a grievous threat justifying extreme treatment or required the shock of fire from the clouds to shake them from their fanatical resistance. The method also allowed maximum fear and terror to be spread with minimum cost and effort. Its defenders were not above justifying "the great humanity of bombing" because it also lowered casualties  HUMANE | 126| | 127 | AIR WAR AND AMERICA'S BRUTAL PEACE among the target population, theoretically at least. It was the old idea that intensified war left everyone better off, updated for an aerial age. Along with Hugh Trenchard, the father of the Royal Air Force, Win- ston Churchill-by 1920 secretary of state for war and air-was in- strumental in dreaming up the new system of imperial order. Though aerial technology did not allow a modicum of precision from the sky for many decades, Churchill praised gas bombs in Febru- ary 1920 as if humane control were already in prospect. The new tools would police "turbulent tribes" without killing most of their targets and merely "inflict various degrees of minor annoyance" enough to bend the savage will. In the same spirit, the British international lawyer J. M. Spaight mused soon after that air power "is capabl
