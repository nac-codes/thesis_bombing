Churchill to bring strategic bombing to an end. The cultural capital of a beaten enemy was devastated with no regard for the presence of thousands of refugees, who would make up a substantial proportion of the tens of thousands dead. His reputation tarnished as a result, an unrepentant Arthur "Bomber" Harris could rightly claim in his memoir that "in this matter of the use of aircraft in war there is, it so happens, no law at all." Should there be? The New York Times, in the outcry around the English former nurse, writer, and pacifist Vera Brittain's coruscating ethi- cal critique of the bombing of Germany, took the tack that no law could make bombing salubrious, and only a durable peace mattered now. "Attempts to humanize [war] have utterly failed," its editori- alists conceded in March 1944. "Let us not deceive ourselves into thinking that war can be made more humane. It cannot. It can only be abolished. Let us resolve that this war shall be so conducted and so concluded that no city shall ever be bombed again." No international lawyers rose to prominence in ethical resistance to urban holocausts, perhaps because the law gave them no basis to do so. No matter their positions in earlier debates, some even championed bombing as the means to the end of a peace beyond the need for humane warfare. J. M. Spaight, the Englishman who had promised in the 1920s that air power would transform hideous bloodletting into bloodless surgery, was cheerful in retirement from the British air ministry when things did not turn out precisely as he had foreseen. Even amid World War II's carnage, he now judged that "the prophets of calamity who fixed their thoughts on the menace of the air were really the slaves to an id√©e fixe." Having complained in the late 1930s that no one listened to him when he argued that air war needed rules, he realized now, with the end of the war in sight, that the bomber had "saved civilization." Indeed, the bomber would prove the guarantor of any postwar pe
