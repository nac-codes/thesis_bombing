The most urgent need, once the United  HUMANE | 140| | 141| AIR WAR AND AMERICA'S BRUTAL PEACE States was finally in the war in 1941, was keeping it in the peace, to avoid repeating the errors of 1919. "We should . . . assume our share of responsibility for ordering the world of which we are inescapably a part," Wright urged his fellow Americans in a magazine. If not, "we may expect the catastrophic decline of civilization to continue." After the decisive battles of Midway and Stalingrad, Wright watched as the Allies began planning the peace in earnest, at a se- ries of summits at Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam. Plans to transform the United Nations from a military alliance into a treaty organiza- tion devoted to ending "the scourge of war," as its 1945 charter pro- claimed, were debated and finalized. Uppermost in Wright's mind was the task of providing "institutions to determine, whenever hos- tilities occur or are threatened, which belligerent is the aggressor and which is the victim defending himself." And to cure the central defect of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the League of Nations, "it must provide itself with means for preventing and stopping the fight." Outlawry would leave behind the inadequate carapace of the League of Nations that caused it to fail, and allow the world to enjoy eternal peace under new arrangements that would identify aggressors and put their aggression down. And then punish them. The ultimate goal, Wright recorded in his epochmaking A Study of War, had to be moving from a world in which enemies "like a wild beast, could only be hunted but not tamed" to one of world citizenship. But getting there required opprobrium for Nazis once they were hunted down. Even as the United Nations met in San Francisco in summer 1945 to finalize its arrangements, the victori- ous Allies in Europe met in London and finalized their wartime plans to try National Socialist criminals.
