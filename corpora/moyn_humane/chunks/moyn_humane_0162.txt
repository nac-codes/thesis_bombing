the world would now try enemies of peace. "War is essentially an evil thing," the judges wrote the next year in their judgment, emphasizing the absolute priority of banning it. "Its con- sequences are not confined to the belligerent States alone, but affect the whole world. To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole."

The legal death of combatants by the tens of millions and the broadest accounting of the costs of the fight that statesmen had committed their people to pay mattered, too. "Once the evil of war has been precipitated, nothing remains but the frag- ile effort . . . to limit the cruelty by which it is conducted," Herbert Wechsler, perhaps the greatest American legal scholar of the time, observed in explaining why Nuremberg slighted such cruelty, in- cluding European Jewry's destruction. "Of these two challenges," he asked rhetorically, "who will deny that the larger offense is the unju
