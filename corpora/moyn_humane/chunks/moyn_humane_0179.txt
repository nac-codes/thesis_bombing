who did not perish in the bombing froze to death on the road. Korea was the most brutal war of the twentieth century, measured by the intensity of violence and per capita civilian deaths. In three years, four million died, and half of them were civilians-a higher proportion of the population than in any modern war, including World War II and the Vietnam conflict. As Korea showed, World War II did not end the tradition of inhumane war, especially against "sav- ages." The winter of 1950 was a bleak parody of what was supposed to be a new age of peace. The American Harry Summers, Jr., had enlisted in the army in 1947-falsifying his birthdate so he could join at fifteen. After serving in Korea and Vietnam, Summers became the sage of the "revisionists." He brazenly downplayed the civilian harm and law- less fighting in Southeast Asia-by comparison with the baseline of Korea. "To antiwar protestors it was axiomatic that the war in Vietnam was the most awful, most barbaric, most terrible war in the history of mankind," Summers grumbled. But he knew better.

Summers's goal of minimizing the hell of Vietnam hardly means that he was wrong that Korea-and the whole history of American war before it-was far worse. And not just for victims but also for the idea that a law calling for
