nment," but- Wright commented in 1960-"the moral basis for such government is still lacking." Thirty years after his campaign for a new U.S. for- eign policy in the 1930s, he wondered: Was the long peace across the Atlantic that the United States achieved after World War II the internationalist one Wilson had portended, or an imperial one with the familiar afflictions of degradation at home and violence abroad? Wright, who now wore up-to-date glasses and a shock of white hair with the same part in the middle, never said. That America could bring world peace, by whatever means nec- essary and beyond the borders of Europe, looked like an ever dim- mer possibility by the time Wright reached old age. Before passing away, he joined a small band of lawyers to devise arguments for why the United States, in escalating its military presence in Vietnam, was now reneging on its own commitment never to begin an aggressive war. Outside Europe, shouldn't the United States have to drink from its own chalice? That a war in Vietnam was likely to be inhumane was a near certainty in 1965. But Wright did not prioritize making the conduct of the conflict more law-abiding. Instead, he pinned everything on the hope that the internationalist structure and legal claims he had championed still had enough force to restrain the new hegemon his country had become. After Wright died in 1970, just shy of his eightieth birthday, and with global peace as elusive as ever, his allies in the movement against the Vietnam War organized a prize in his honor. It was first awarded in February 1972 to a dissident analyst in the Defense De- partment, who after years of misgivings had concluded that-for the moment, at least-American peace was still an oxymoron. That honoree was Daniel Ellsberg.  PART II HUMANITY  Epilogue ON JANUARY 3. 2020. AN AIRBUS 320 CARRYING QASSIM SOLEIMANI landed in Iraq.
