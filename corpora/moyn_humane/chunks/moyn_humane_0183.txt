He mainly aimed to take the policies of his predecessors further than they had, finalizing troop pullouts in unwinnable heavy-footprint wars while increasing America's light- and no-footprint presence worldwide, and striking boldly when he deemed it necessary for the purposes of global control. That Soleimani had long been seen as the second-most-powerful man in Iran didn't exempt him from becoming a target of Trump's. On that January morning just outside the Baghdad airport, Solei- mani's two-car convoy was struck by a Reaper drone. A successor to the Predators widely used in the prior two presidential adminis- trations, and with a price tag of $64 million apiece, this fancy hard- ware hovered above its prey for ten minutes before firing its Hellfire missiles. Its airborne capacity allows operators to identify the tar- get with certainty, and even glimpse his clothing, before the body wearing it is burned to a crisp on impact.

Indeed, in the United States, a much more aggressive and larger crew of in- ternational lawyers than at any time since Vietnam attempted to raise consciousness about the importance of rules prohibiting force abroad. It happened in part because the killing seemed for a long moment to risk a frightening escalation, or even the possibility of war between nations.
