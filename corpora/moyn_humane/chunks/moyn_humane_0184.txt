recedent since World War II was Ronald Reagan's strike on the home of the Libyan leader Moammar Qaddafi in 1986, which no one admitted was an attempt to target the dictator personally. But there was much more conti- | 315 | nuity than novelty in Soleimani's killing, and the consensus of na- tional security lawyers was that the law allowed for it. "That is our system," the former government lawyer and Harvard professor Jack Goldsmith noted on Twitter, with a faint tone of regret. In war, al- though it is a matter of life and death, the United States had long since descended into a syndrome in which "one person decides." He might have added: and in which one country does. Along the way, acts of one-off killing such as this had been nor- malized in U.S. policy and deemed legal and right. And even though the U.S. strike took place on the territory of a state that had not con- sented to Soleimani's killing, permissive doctrines had already been forged to cover that eventuality. Trump benefited from the fact that no civilians died in the attack, which had been given the green light only after verification-even under Trump-that the innocent and uninvolved were out of harm's way. And, by the time days later that Trump's lawyers issued their theory of the strike's legality, public attention had moved on. Still, far beyond the minor grumbling of the late Obama years, the genuine national debate around Trump's aggressive move was reveal- ing. It was striking that American security and its limits were debated in terms of international law. Learned interpretations of concepts such as "imminence" graced the news and op-ed pages of national publications, something that had never happened earlier during the war on terror when prior administrations reduced to meaningless- ness the requirement that self-defense requires a looming threat. Sim- ilarly, invocation of the domestic law's prohibition of "assassination" stretched back to revelations of U.S. Cold War malfeasance. Such talk,
