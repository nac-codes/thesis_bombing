"We will follow the laws of armed conflict," Trump's defense secretary reassured an anxious world within days-without agreeing that the U.S. execution of Soleimani had broken the law forbidding use of force and risked another Middle Eastern quagmire. FOR ALL ITS APPEAL AND IMPORTANCE, THE IDEA OF MORE HUMANE war can obscure the residual violence that it still involves. Around the world, brutal ground war is hardly a thing of the past. And even America's direct light- and no-footprint engagements today spill too much blood. "War is represented as an unfortunate obligation thrust upon the exceptional nation, the United States, by a dysfunctional world which the United States has a salvationist responsibility to mend, albeit by force of arms," writes the anthropologist Hugh Gusterson, who has done extensive fieldwork in Waziristan, a poor, remote tribal region in Pakistan where U.S. drones have been deployed for more than a de- | 317 | cade.

Invocations of the care and precision of drone violence still abet or accompany too much violence, as the lure of "humanizing security" helps Americans to take the bait of war. Horrified by any level of illicit death, Gusterson notes that the death toll in Waziristan has mounted into the thousands, even while the real evil faced by people there is the "living death" of "fear as a way of life." Increasingly, the fate of some foreign populations is not dying but living under drones or in fear that the Special Forces will stop by. Human rights activists have found that people who live in permanent fear are prey to the same sorts of responses caused by suffering from or witnessing outright violence, including classic symptoms of post-traumati
