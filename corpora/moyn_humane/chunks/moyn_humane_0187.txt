ctivists have found that people who live in permanent fear are prey to the same sorts of responses caused by suffering from or witnessing outright violence, including classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress. After all, they live in a situation in which anyone can be targeted without notice and the constant risk of fatality or injury cannot be eliminated. What is most appall- ing, in this view, is a new "military humanism" that masks the same old death-dealing. It is hard to argue with these conclusions, not merely in Afghan- istan but across Syria, where in recent years the United States has complied with (its version of) the laws of armed conflict, razing a city in the midst of an internationalized civil war, as Americans de- bated whether they were too involved or uninvolved in the gory catastrophe.

The bitter truth, however, is that exposing America's illicit vi- olence, and showing that humanity is just a cover for it, has not worked. The claim that the carnage is humane in form and legally contained by rules has provided it legitimacy.

And without downplaying the residual vio- lence of our wars, humane war is more than a mask: four thousand dead-on the high side of current civilian mortality estimates for Waziristan-is not four million or even four hundred or forty thou- sand. The degree of residual violence is lower than when Vietnamese rice growers faced America's intense bombardments in 1968, or when Algerian sheep herders got caught up in French counterinsurgency in 1958, or when Malayans suffered under similar treatment from the British in 1948, to say nothing of the genocidal brut
