and miniaturization-and the pressure of America's war on terror. Autonomous weapons systems, after all, are the ultimate no-footprint weapon, promising to put military drone operators out of their jobs. And while experts in the technology have debated our algorithmic future in war, especially the stages of diminishing con- trol, custodians of the laws of war have begun fighting over how the rules apply, and whether humanity needs new ones. "World War R" could exempt humans on both sides from combat-but somehow that does not seem likely, given the existence of great powers con- tinuing to strive for more and more asymmetry and more and more immunity for their side, and more exposure and injury for the other. In a very different tactic than what prevailed in the organization between the 1970s and the war on terror, Human Rights Watch has led the way in appealing for a ban on "killer robots." It has called for new law, not observance of old law, and demanded abolition, not pal- liation. In 2012, the group began a campaign that has drawn together a host of other nongovernmental organizations and (so far) thirty coun- tries interested in stopping the new technology of war before it gets off the ground. Pakistan, where drones have flown the most missions and attacked with the most intensity, was the first to join, in 2013. Along with other great powers, the United States has pushed back against the attempt-reminiscent of the earliest responses to the prospect of air war a century before-to regulate before the threat materializes. If our country doesn't act fast to explore the new weaponry and get in front, its representatives say, it will fall behind other states taking the low road-or a terrorist group doing so on its own. In 2017, a Group of Government Experts began meeting to develop standards for autonomous weapons systems. If properly designed, these systems will allow for more careful and caring war, such authorities insist. For sure, obedience to the requirement t
