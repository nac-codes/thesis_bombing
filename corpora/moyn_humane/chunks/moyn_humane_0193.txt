Improvement itself can be a recipe for new modes of abasing ourselves and dominating our fellow human beings-not diminishing inequality but reinventing its terms. In his concern that advocates for more humane war could help make it endless for a public that tolerates it, Leo Tolstoy fixated on cor- poral wrongs and physical violence. Advocacy aimed at humane war he contended, was no more ethically plausible than agitation for hu- mane slavery, with daily episodes of torture replaced by everlasting- but kind and gentle direction of labor and service. Audiences who accept endless war out of the belief that its humanity excuses them, the truculent moralist inveighed, were fooling themselves. They were no better than those who rest content with more humane techniques of animal slaughter, leaving them to carve their steaks and fricassee their chickens with eager gusto and in good conscience. Tolstoy's arresting comparisons help explain how so much re- maining violence is ignored by those who accept our wars and press for them to be free from civilian harm and captive mistreatment. But the analogies themselves risk ignoring the fact that sometimes domi- nation and rule can take place nonviolently. In the current and future trajectory of humane conflict, it may turn out that the most ominous feature of America's evolving war is that it has begun to edit out physical violence-including the killing of combatants-to make war something new: a form of decreasingly violent policing. | 323 | Amazingly, what count as some of the most visionary proposals for regulating war actually pray for this outcome. With deterritorial- ized and endless war now the way of the world, indeed, perhaps the best reform is not to end it but to contain it, creating for abroad the kind of regulated security that's routine at home. In this spirit, it can sometimes seem the height of idealism to demand global policing: so humane a form of war that some might question whether it is even war anymore. One
