Though better than outrageous death and pain, hu- mane policing is a depressing goal whether abroad or at home when it succeeds and not just when it fails-especially when conducted by the rich and powerful on the poor and weak. You don't have to agree with Tolstoy that war is never for a good cause to conclude that it almost always is not. You certainly don't have to think, as he did, that state power can only take the form of violence or of an insidiously nonviolent form of subjugation, and is best abolished for that reason. The very freedom and justice that Tolstoy prized might even depend on such power or, in the direst straits, on war itself. Even if so, his worries about reforming violence certainly do pertain to the wars America has fought lately-and to the new version of military force it has, like no power in history, made imaginable for our common global future. A future of blood- less global discipline is a chilling thing, just as the alternative to killer police ought not to be the control and domination that leaves its victims alive and unscathed. You may conclude we need policing, not just locally but globally, but that commitment could never jus- tify intensively policing some while immunizing others against any enforcers to stop their crimes. At our stage in the coming of humane war, its advocates and au- diences should reevaluate whether they have lost their way in help- ing to entrench continuing violence, which they could struggle to end instead. If the quest for more humane war could someday min- imize not just collateral death and damage but even combatant kill- ing and injury, the looming threat of something far more disquieting is also real. What if the elemental aim of endless war is not the death of enemy soldiers
