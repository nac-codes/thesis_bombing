the decisive elements that prewar thinkers and advocates had so confidently predicted. Rather, air superiority and the utilization of airpower to break the opponent proved to be elusive and intractable problems. Enemy air forces could and did live to fight another day despite setbacks and defeat. Only the elimination of their supporting industries and resources, or the occupation of their bases by ground forces, guaranteed complete victory. The accomplishment of the former task proved extraordinarily difficult, while the latter indicated a degree of interdependence among air, ground, and naval forces that airpower advocates had so casually dismissed before the war.

Entirely different strategic factors determined control over the constitution and strategies of each different European air force, not to mention the Army Air Corps in the United States. To understand the course of those developments as well as the doctrine that guided the employment of airpower in the Second World War, one must grasp not only those factors influencing the air forces themselves but also the larger problems of national policy and strategy that influenced both politicians and the military. χχίν   ## p. xxv (#25) #############################################  The Luftwaffe, as with all military organizations, was a child of its time.

Conversely, and not surprisingly, the peculiar forces that had guided and molded German history exercised their infl
