War II. That Germany was not able to wage a successful "strategic" bombing campaign in 1940 reflected merely the fact that German air strategists in the prewar period, like those in other nations, had considerably overestimated their ability to inflict punishing strategic damage with the weapons at hand. Before the war, the same trends that marked the air forces of Great Britain and the United States also were present in the officer corps of the Luftwaffe. But an important geographic consideration, the fact that Germany was a continental power, had an additional impact on German strategic thinking. In any conceivable conflict involving the military forces of the Reich, Germany faced the probability of land operations at the outset of hostilities. Thus, it would scarcely improve Germany's strategic position if at the same time that the Luftwaffe launched aerial attacks on London, Paris, and Warsaw Germany's enemies defeated the Wehrmacht on the border and overran Silesia, East Prussia, and the Rhineland. THE ECONOMIC PROBLEM Constraining and guiding the course of German rearmament throughout the 1930's was an economic situation considerably different from that which determined British or American rearmament.2 The only raw material possessed by Germany in any abundance was coal.3 All other raw materials required for the continued functioning of the German economy, not to mention the successful prosecution of war, had to be imported to one extent or another. Imports of oil, rubber, aluminum, and other critical materials necessary for the continued functioning of the Luftwaffe and the Wehrmacht were all subject to blockade. Moreover, in peacetime the Germans had to use a substantial portion of their industrial production to export goods in order to earn the foreign exchange necessary to pay for these strategic raw material imports needed for rearmament. Symptomatic of this German economic vulnerability was the situation in the petroleum industry. In order to maintain a
