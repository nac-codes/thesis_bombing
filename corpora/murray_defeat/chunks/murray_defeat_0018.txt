e necessary to pay for these strategic raw material imports needed for rearmament. Symptomatic of this German economic vulnerability was the situation in the petroleum industry. In order to maintain an increasingly motorized economy and to cut down on dependence from foreign sources, the Germans pushed construction of synthetic fuel plants (i.e., plants that used coal to make petroleum products). 1   ## p. xxviii (#28) ##########################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT Nevertheless, in spite of substantial investments in a synthetic fuel industry, synthetic production never caught up with demand during the 1930's. While the percentage of synthetic fuel in terms of consumption steadily increased in this period, Germany imported more fuel in 1937 than she had at the beginning of the decade. Demand had simply increased faster than production. The fuel situation in the summer of 1938 reflects the extent of the problem. In June of that year, supplies in storage tanks could cover only 25 percent of mobilization requirements on the average, four months of full wartime needs. Supplies of aviation lubricants were as low as 6 percent of mobilization requirements." This was, of course, a reflection of Germany's inherent inability to meet petroleum requirements from her own resources and her considerable problem in earning foreign exchange to pay for strategic raw material imports. In fact, the most serious constraint on German rearmament in the 1930's was the lack of foreign exchange. Without hard currency to cover imports, German industry could not reach the level of armament production demanded by the Wehrmacht and Hitler. Indeed, the Reich experienced increasing difficulties in acquiring these raw materials required for military production. A series of more difficult economic crises, caused by a lack of foreign exchange, marked the course of German rearmament throughout the 1930's.' Beginning in 1930, a worldwide depression had caused a sharp dropoff in the val
