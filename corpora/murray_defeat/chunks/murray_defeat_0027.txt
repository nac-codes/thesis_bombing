lead in civil aviation was such that by 1927, German airlines flew greater distances with more passengers than their French, British, and Italian competitors together.21 This experience in long-distance flying, navigation, and instrument flying obviously had a positive impact on developing the Luftwaffe in the interwar period. Still, the problems facing the Nazis in January 1933 in the creation of an air force that could serve as an effective tool of diplomatic and military policy were enormous. Only a tiny cadre of experienced officers existed within the army and navy; Lufthansa experience was not directly convertible into a military force; and the German aircraft industry, weakened not only by the depression but also by internecine quarrels amongst its almost bankrupt firms, was not prepared for massive expansion.

Unfortunately, however, for the efficient functioning of the German command system, Göring, as Minister of Aviation, refused to subordinate himself to the Minister of War, Werner von Blomberg. Thus, Blomberg faced the impossible task of coordinating and controlling the three services. His problems were further compounded by the fact that Göring, as Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe, went around him at every opportunity.22 In the long run, Göring had a disastrous impact on the Luftwaffe's history and his position as numb
