he fact that Göring, as Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe, went around him at every opportunity.22 In the long run, Göring had a disastrous impact on the Luftwaffe's history and his position as number two in the political hierarchy prevented Hitler from removing him even after his many failures demanded such action. Initially, Göring's political tasks as Hitler's chief aide during the consolidation of power (the establishment of the Gestapo, the savaging of the Communists, and the purge of Ernst Röhm and the S.A.) absorbed a substantial portion of "der Dicke's" time.23 Thus, while Göring as Reich Air Minister and after March 1935 Commander in Chief played at the role, at least until 1936 others made the substantive decisions creating the new force. Göring's mental framework was that of a squadron-level fighter pilot which he had been in the First World War; and throughout his tenure as Luftwaffe commander, he remained largely ignorant of supply, logistics, strategy, aircraft capabilities, technology, and engineering-in other words, just about everything having to do with airpower. Compounding his ignorance was the fact that Göring took a rather loose view on the subject of hard work, and his visits to the Air Ministry were sporadic at best. In July 1938, during an address to aircraft manufacturers, Göring even admitted that he saw Ernst Udet, at this time in charge of all the Luftwaffe's technical departments, only once a week.24 The long-range implications of such leadership spelled disaster. Nevertheless, in the short term, Göring's political pull was of great use in the establishment of an independent air arm. Göring was particularly fortunate in his leading subordinate. Erhard Milch, Göring's and Hitler's selection for the position of State Secretary in the new Air Ministry, possessed tremendous drive, a thorough knowledge of the production capabilities of the German aircraft industry, a detailed understanding of its managers and designers, and, perhaps most i
