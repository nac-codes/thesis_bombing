currency in the technical aspects of their service. The result was that they became at best technocrats and operational experts with limited vision. 32 Thus, with perhaps the exception of Wever and to a lesser extent Milch, the officer corps showed a lack of understanding of the larger issues revolving around the interrelation of airpower to national strategy, defects which may, indeed, have been nothing less than fatal. At the outset of rearmament in 1933, German planners faced the problem as to what role the Luftwaffe would play within the larger framework of national strategy. In May 1933, Milch, the key figure in the Luftwaffe's organization and development in the 1933-36 period, received a major study from one of his Lufthansa subordinates, Dr. Robert Knauss, on the strategic concept for the new air force.33 Knauss' report contained major elements of Douhet's "strategic" bombing philosophy, Tirpitz's "risk theory," and what would today be regarded as "deterrence" doctrine. He believed that the purpose of the regime was the "restoration of Germany's great power position in Europe" and argued that since 6   ## p. 7 (#35) ###############################################  ORIGINS AND PREPARATION Poland, and particularly France, would resist such a development, Germany faced the immediate possibility of a preventive war waged by those two powers. To overcome German military weakness through rearmament, thereby re-establishing Germany's great power status, Knauss suggested the rapid creation of a strong air force. The decisive element in this force would be the deterrent effect of a fleet of 400 four-engine bombers. Knauss argued that modern industrialized society offered targets which, when destroyed, would halt the enemy's industrial production and that population centers offered the possibility of breaking the enemy's morale. Naturally, he felt that the newly created totalitarian society of Germany could endure the pressures of bombing better than the fractured so
