raining aircraft to expand the flying base. 35 The "combat" aircraft hardly deserved that characterization. From a January 1933 industrial base of 4,000 workers, the aircraft industry expanded to 16,870 workers in 1934 and to 204,100 workers by the fall of 1938.36 To a great extent, this represented Milch's great triumph as an organizer and bureaucrat. While Milch played the decisive role in the administrative and industrial tasks of creating the Luftwaffe, Wever played a no-less-important role in formulating the new service's doctrine and strategy. He was not an unabashed advocate of "strategic" bombing but rather argued for a broadly based air strategy. Wever did not believe that the Luftwaffe's existence as a separate service gave it a mission entirely independent of the army and navy. Rather, he argued that its mission should complement those of the other services. Thus, the Luftwaffe's contribution to victory could involve attacks on an enemy's air forces, his army, his fleet, or 7   ## p. 8 (#36) ###############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT even the destruction of his resources and armament industry. The conditions of the general situation and overall national strategy would determine in what form one would wage the air battle. While not denying the possibility of air defense or the importance of fighters, Wever felt that the â€œdecisive weapon of air warfare is the bomber.''37 Meanwhile, a careful analysis of Germany's strategic situation raised doubts as to whether "strategic" bombing should be the Luftwaffe's sole mission. A war game conducted during the winter of 1933-34 indicated that a bomber fleet alone could not immediately destroy the enemy's air fleet. The conclusion was that strong fighter forces, as well as antiaircraft guns, were necessary to protect the Reich's industrial and population centers. 38 Wever's thinking on the subject of airpower was best summed up in the formulation of German air doctrine that first appeared in
