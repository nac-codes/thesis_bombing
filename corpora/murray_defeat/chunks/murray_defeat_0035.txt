t take too long to be decisive and might thus be too late to help the army and the navy. He emphasized that only the strongest cooperation among the three services could achieve the overall objectives of national grand strategy. The air war against the enemy industrial base should occur only when (1) an opportunity existed to affect quickly the war's course, (2) when land and naval preparations had prepared the way, (3) when a stalemate had occurred, or (4) when a decisive effect could only be achieved through the destruction of the enemy's economic sources of power. Wever's death in the spring of 1936 was a major blow to the Luftwaffe. However, it did not result in cancellation of the four-engine "strategic" bomber project as some have claimed.41 In 1936, the Air Ministry cancelled the 8   ## p. 9 (#37) ###############################################  ORIGINS AND PREPARATION development of the four-engine Dornier Do 19 and Junkers Ju 89, because suitable engines were not yet available from the German aircraft industry to provide adequate power.* The failure to have a suitable engine available in 1936 and 1937 reflected the fact that German air rearmament had only begun in 1933. As a result, German engine research and development was in some important respects behind what was occurring in Great Britain and the United States. Moreover, the long lead-time required for engine development constrained German aircraft design throughout the 1930's. The Germans did embark on the He 177 project in 1937 in the belief that Heinkel could design and build a long-range "strategic" bomber by the early 1940's. The design of the He 177, in effect, represented an effort to shortcut the development process of a high-powered engine for a heavy bomber by placing four engines within two nacelles. Heinkel designers expected that by cutting down on the drag, they would have a bomber comparable to other four-engine aircraft with more powerful engines. Unfortunately for the Luftwaffe, they w
