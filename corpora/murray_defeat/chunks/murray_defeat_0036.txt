lles. Heinkel designers expected that by cutting down on the drag, they would have a bomber comparable to other four-engine aircraft with more powerful engines. Unfortunately for the Luftwaffe, they were never able to overcome the difficulties inherent in the design; hence the failure of the program reflected the failure of engineering and not a lack of interest in "strategic" bombing.42 Wever's broadly based approach to the question of airpower should not obscure the fact that his writings never denied the possibility that "strategic" bombing could play an important part in air warfare. Moreover, a significant portion of the Luftwaffe's doctrinal thinking remained enamored with "strategic" bombing throughout the thirties. There was an obvious reason why this should be so: The concepts of total war and total mobilization had proved attractive to much of the German military throughout the interwar period. While Seeckt argued for establishment of an elite army, Ludendorff articulated the concept that modern war had become total. Unlike most interwar military thinkers who sought to escape the horrors of World War I's mass warfare, Ludendorff embraced what had happened and argued that Germany must prepare in ruthless fashion during peace for the next war. Among other things, Ludendorff argued that war involved the entire population in the conflict, not just armies. In his view, economic production had become as important as battles on the frontline.43 The 1918 collapse convinced him that Germany required a dictatorship for the next war and, even more importantly, that some method must be found to inspire the national unity that had come apart in the last months of the war.44 From the first, the Nazi Party appeared as a particularly attractive means to insure such a unity of national will. Hitler's popularity with the masses offered the possibility of establishing a national cohesion that the conception of total war demanded.45 Thus, what made the Nazi movement attractiv
