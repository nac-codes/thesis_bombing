national will. Hitler's popularity with the masses offered the possibility of establishing a national cohesion that the conception of total war demanded.45 Thus, what made the Nazi movement attractive to the military throughout the 1930's was the fact that the Nazis seemingly provided the psychological basis and preparation necessary for total war. "Ein Volk, ein Reich, *German aircraft designations do not contain a hyphen between manufacture and model number. American designations do. The text will reflect national preferences. 9   ## p. 10 (#38) ##############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT ein FÃ¼hrer" was more than a slogan; in the mass rallies and propaganda displays, it guaranteed that the 1918 collapse would not recur. Thus, Ludendorff's conception of total war and the mass movement of the Nazi Party provided an affinity between the military and the National Socialist movement that helps explain the readiness of the officer corps to serve a party that hardly represented their upper-class attitudes. Many within the Luftwaffe found in this political and psychological preparation for war a basis to argue that the next war would be a total war of the air and that because of the national unity that the Nazis had created, Germany could better withstand such a struggle. In the May 1933 memorandum discussed above, Knauss argued that "the terrorizing of the enemy's chief cities and industrial regions through bombing would lead that much more quickly to a collapse of morale, the weaker the national character of his people is, and the more that social and political rifts cleave his society." Knauss assumed that a totalitarian society like Nazi Germany would prove more capable of enduring bombing attacks than the fractured societies of Britain and France.46 Such attitudes played an important role in Luftwaffe thinking throughout the remainder of the thirties. Knauss himself went on from the Air Ministry to become the head of the new Air War College
