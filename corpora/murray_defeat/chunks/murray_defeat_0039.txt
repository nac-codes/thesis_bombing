e Luftwaffe in a unified and massed 'strategic' air war" that could provide for better long- range support. 50 The failure of the Luftwaffe to progress further towards a "strategic" bombing capability is attributable to several factors. The first is that many within the Luftwaffe thought that they possessed sufficient capability with their twin-engine aircraft to launch "strategic" attacks against Germany's most likely continental opponents-France, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. England presented greater 10   ## p. 11 (#39) ##############################################  ORIGINS AND PREPARATION problems, but even here General Felmy, Commander of Luftflotte 2 and charged with planning of an air war against Britain in 1939, saw possibilities. Concluding the 1939 spring planning effort, Felmy admitted to his subordinates that the Luftwaffe did not yet possess any of the prerequisites for a successful "strategic" bombing offensive against Great Britain. He did suggest, however, that the panic that had broken out in London in September at the height of the Munich crisis indicated that a massive aerial onslaught directed against London might break Britain's powers of resistance." A second factor lay on the technical side: The engineers never solved the He 177 design difficulties. Moreover, not only did Germany not possess the economic strength and resources to build a "strategic" bombing force on the scale of the British and American effort of 1943-44 but few airmen of any nation in the prewar period had foreseen the enormous magnitude of the industrial and military effort that "strategic" bombing would require. Thus, it is not surprising that Germany was not much better prepared to launch a â€œstrategic" bombing campaign than Britain in 1939. As previously mentioned, Wever's death in 1936 was disastrous for the future course of the Luftwaffe but in a sense other than that which most historians have suggested. First, he provided the glue that held the Luftwaffe together in the
