sition required. Shortly after Munich, Hitler demanded a fivefold increase in the Luftwaffe by 1942, an impossible goal given the economic constraints and the megalomaniacal proportion of the program. (Such a force would require 85 percent of the world's aviation fuel and would cost 60 million RM, a total equivalent to all German defense spending for the 1933-39 period.) Senior officers correctly concluded that there was no 11   ## p. 12 (#40) ##############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT prospect of accomplishing such a plan. Jeschonnek, however, announced, "Gentlemen, in my view it is our duty to support the Führer and not work against him."'54 Such an attitude was not consistent with the traditions of the general staff, but fully conformed to Hitler's belief that his generals were there not to give advice but to carry out orders. 55 The almost yearly changes in the position of Chief of Staff from 1936 to 1939 was not the only result of Göring's mishandling of the Luftwaffe. He now severely constrained Milch by balancing the State Secretary with others within the Luftwaffe's bureaucracy. Ernest Udet, a great fighter pilot in World War I and barnstormer of the 1920's, received an appointment as head of the Luftwaffe's technical departments as well as the Office of Air Armament where he controlled research and development for the Luftwaffe. Udet did not possess the technical or engineering skills to handle such responsibilities and was a dreadful administrator. He had no less than 26 separate departments reporting directly to him. 56 In sum, Göring possessed neither the ability nor background to run the enormously expanded Luftwaffe. Milch was increasingly isolated from the centers of power; and the other top leaders, such as Kesselring, Udet, and Jeschonnek, did not possess Wever's strategic insight. Long-range planning and strategic thinking went by the boards, and the Luftwaffe increasingly became a force that reacted to day-to-day political
