Jeschonnek, did not possess Wever's strategic insight. Long-range planning and strategic thinking went by the boards, and the Luftwaffe increasingly became a force that reacted to day-to-day political and operational pressures. The result of this increasingly chaotic organizational situation showed up most directly in the production programs of the late prewar period. Even considering their raw material shortages and their economic and foreign exchange difficulties, the Germans undercut the production capacity of their aircraft industry. Waste, obsolete production methods, and bad planning characterized the efforts of even the major manufacturers. Throughout the late 1930's, the Germans produced numerous plans for aircraft production due to constantly changing goals and priorities. By 1939, aircraft production was only 70 percent of stated production goals (goals that were significantly under Hitler's demand for quintupling of the Luftwaffe).57 The following figures in Table 158 reflect the shortfall between planned expansion and actual production figures in the last years of peace.

The repercussions of this situation were not immediately apparent since the Luftwaffe's size and strength proved sufficient to meet initial wartime demands in Poland and France. But in long-ra
