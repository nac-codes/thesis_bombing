r units for replacement. As a result, the Air Ministry rushed the Ju 86, He 111, and Do 17 into production before complete evaluation. None of the three was fully satisfactory with the Ju 86 virtually useless, while the He 111 showed the most potential for improvement.62 The 1936 medium bomber program was meant to serve as an interim measure until a third generation of bombers arrived. Udet's growing love affair with the dive bomber disastrously affected that program. In Spain, the Luftwaffe had experienced difficulty in hitting targets accurately from high altitude, while the Ju 87 was most accurate in putting bombs directly on target. From this experience, Udet concluded that every bomber should be a dive bomber. There were sound arguments for the need to achieve more accurate bombing, because the low production capacity of the German munitions industry in the late thirties did not allow for much wastage of bombs.63 But the decision that the next generation of bombers should have the characteristics of dive bombers was manifestly impractical, if not impossible. The results were serious for both the Ju 88 and the He 177. In the case of the Ju 88 prototype, Udet's demand that it possess a dive-bombing capability, along with 50,000 other design changes, increased the aircraft weight from 7 to 12 tons with a 13   ## p. 14 (#42) ##############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT concomitant loss in speed from 500 km/h to 300 km/h. Moreover, these changes delayed actual production by at least a year.64 The additional requirement that the He 177 be able to dive bomb came in the middle of program development and virtually insured that, given an inherently complex engine design, the model would never evolve into an effective heavy bomber. 65 66 GÃ¶ring's and Hitler's fascination with numbers also served to distort the maintenance and supply system. Theoretically, the Luftwaffe based its approach to airpower on the belief that a flying unit was not combat-re
