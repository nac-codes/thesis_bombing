the implications of the Luftwaffe. As late as September 1937, one military leader told the British that with "a veritable forest of guns" over the Maginot Line, France could prevent the German air force from intervening in the land battle.68 The following month, the French assured the visiting British Chief of the Imperial General Staff that they planned to strengthen the Maginot Line to counter German aircraft superiority and that they believed any "enemy would require an unrealizable supremacy of machines to get over the antiaircraft defenses. . . .''69 If at first the air threat did not impress the French, it certainly upset the British.

The conclusion drawn from an assessment of an April 1936 war game in the Luftwaffe staff warned that German air rearmament thus far was insufficient and inferior to the French air force.70 Not until 1938 did the Luftwaffe begin to realize its potential. Before that point, events in southern Europe had already influenced the Luftwaffe's development. While the Germans completed the first stages of rearmament, the Spanish Civil War occurred. Hitler willingly provided substantial aid to the rebels, especially in the air, but regarded the war mostly as useful in distracting
