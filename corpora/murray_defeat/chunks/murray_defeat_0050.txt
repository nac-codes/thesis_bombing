e experience gleaned from night attacks proved generally beneficial, while the problem of hitting targets accurately in daylight missions helped push Udet towards his conception that every bomber should have a dive-bombing capability. At night, the Germans discovered the difficulties not only in finding targets but in hitting them.82 This led to a recognition that navigational aids were critical for bad weather and night operations. In March 1939, Kesselring admitted that even given a high level of technical competence, he doubted whether the average bomber crew could hit their target with any degree of accuracy at night or in bad weather.83 To help overcome this difficulty, Luftwaffe scientists experimented with radio direction systems as an aid to navigation and as a technological answer to the problem of bombing targets in conditions of limited visibility. The "Knickebein" system, first used in the Battle of Britain, was a direct result.84 16   ## p. 17 (#45) ##############################################  ORIGINS AND PREPARATION The introduction of a new generation of bombers and fighters after 1936 caused serious transition problems. High accident rates coupled with low in-commission rates continued to plague the transition program as late as the summer of 1938. At that time, Luftwaffe operational ready rates were surprisingly low. On August 1, 1938, the in-commission rate for bombers was 49 percent, for fighters 70 percent, and for the whole force 57 percent.85 Only after drastically reducing flying and training time could the Luftwaffe bring its in-commission rate to a respectable level by the end of September 1938, shortly before the onset of the planned invasion of Czechoslovakia.86 The level of aircrew training was equally deplorable. In August, the Luftwaffe possessed barely two-thirds of its authorized crew strength, and over 40 percent of the crews on duty were not fully operational. Table II87 helps to point out the extent of the problem. TABLE II Airc
