possessed barely two-thirds of its authorized crew strength, and over 40 percent of the crews on duty were not fully operational. Table II87 helps to point out the extent of the problem.

The compression of these tasks into a very short time span has once more and in clear fashion pointed out the known lack of readiness in the maintenance of flying equipment as well as among technical personnel. . . . The consequence of these circumstances was: (a) a constant and, for firstline aircraft, complete lack of reserves both as accident replacements and for mobilization; (b) a weakening of the aircraft inventory in the training schools in favor of regular units; (c) a lack of reserve engines and supplies for the timely equipment of airfields, supply services, and depots both for peacetime needs as well as mobilization. 88 17   ## p. 18 (#46) ###################################
