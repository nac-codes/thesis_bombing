###################################  ORIGINS AND PREPARATION May 1939, Felmy concluded an address by highlighting the lack of preparation for a “strategic" bombing offensive against Britain. He doubted whether the Luftwaffe could achieve more than a limited success in 1940 and admitted that the Luftwaffe would not have one air division fully trained and prepared to attack Britain in the summer of 1939. Considering Second Air Force's equipment, preparations for an air offensive on Britain were totally inadequate (völlig ungenügend).10 100 This state of affairs was a result of Germany's strategic situation. Luftwaffe planners had to face the fact that their first commitment would be to a major ground war. The conduct and the success of those operations would determine whether Germany would surmount her narrow economic and strategic base and thus be able to fight a protracted world war. If not, the war would end right there. In 1938, "Fall Grün," the proposed attack on Czechoslovakia, would have involved the Wehrmacht in a major land campaign against the Czech Republic, leaving the army with only weak ground forces to protect the Polish and French frontiers. As was the case with "Fall Weiss," the attack on Poland, the Wehrmacht would then have faced a major ground campaign in the west. 101 The result of this strategic situation was that the Luftwaffe tied its plans for both 1938 and 1939 closely to the operations of the army. The tasks of the two air fleets assigned to support the invasion of Czechoslovakia were to destroy the Czech air force, to hinder the mobilization and movement of reserves, to support the army's advance, and only then to attack the enemy's population. 102 Similarly, the Luftwaffe's general staff underscored that the most important missions in the west would be to attack the French air force and prevent a breakthrough along the Westwall by Allied forces. 103 The same pattern repeated itself in 1939, except that this time Hitler refused to allow him
