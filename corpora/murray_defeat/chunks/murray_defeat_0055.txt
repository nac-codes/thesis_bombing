would be to attack the French air force and prevent a breakthrough along the Westwall by Allied forces. 103 The same pattern repeated itself in 1939, except that this time Hitler refused to allow himself to be robbed on an opportunity to wage his "little war." CONCLUSION In conclusion, several features of prewar Luftwaffe doctrine deserve further elaboration. The first, and most obvious, is that the prevailing historical picture of a Luftwaffe tied closely to the army's coattails is no longer tenable. Most Luftwaffe leaders from GÃ¶ring through the general staff believed, as did their counterparts in Britain and the United States, that "strategic" bombing was the chief mission of an air force and that in such a role they would win the next war. 104 They probably did not consider the twin-engine aircraft at their disposal in 1937 and 1938 sufficient for a campaign against Britain, Russia, or the United States; but within the context of Central Europe, were not such aircraft adequate for attacking Warsaw, Prague, and Paris? Most Germans thought so, and certainly the leaders of the French and British air forces agreed with them. For the long run, the Luftwaffe had begun work on a four-engine bomber for more distant targets. Like most of their contemporaries in other air forces, Luftwaffe officers considerably overestimated the possibilities and potential of "strategic" air war, both in terms of industrial damage and its impact on morale. This was neither surprising nor unique, since there was so little 19   ## p. 20 (#48) ##############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT empirical evidence on which to base predictions. The prevalence of such attitudes within the Luftwaffe's officer corps helps explain Rotterdam as well as the seemingly casual shift from an air superiority strategy to a direct attack on London during the Battle of Britain. Moreover, in their approach to "strategic" bombing, the Germans showed a greater awareness of the difficulties inv
