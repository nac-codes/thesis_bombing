continue. Further exacerbating the Luftwaffe's dangerous position were certain critical research and development decisions taken in the last month before the outbreak of war. In December 1938, Milch pushed through a major reorganization of the production system so that the aircraft industry could concentrate on developing a few superior aircraft. 106 In August 1939 shortly before the outbreak of war, GÃ¶ring along with Udet, Milch, and Jeschonnek decided to constrict development and production. They placed strong development emphasis on the He 177, Ju 88, and Me 210.107 While such emphasis was not meant to halt research and development on the next generation of aircraft, it did tend to slow down experimentation. When the Germans awoke to the danger in 1942, it was already too late; they would fight the great air battles of 1943 and 1944 with basically the same equipment that they had used against Poland. 108 As discussed above, there were factors pushing the Germans towards a broader conception of airpower than was the case in Britain and America. Economic reality placed severe limits on the nature and force structure of the Luftwaffe in the prewar period. Even more important than this limiting factor was Germany's general strategic placement in the heart of the European continent. Unlike British and American air strategists, German air strategists faced the prospect of a large-scale land battle from the moment that a war began and were never in a position to ignore 20   ## p. 21 (#49) ##############################################  ORIGINS AND PREPARATION entirely the demands of Germany's ground forces. Simultaneously, most German airmen did believe that "strategic" bombing would be a decisive factor in the coming war. Thus, German air strategy was a combination of these two divergent elements. So with the outbreak of hostilities, German airmen found themselves in quite different strategic circumstances than they had originally envisioned. Unfortunately for the West
