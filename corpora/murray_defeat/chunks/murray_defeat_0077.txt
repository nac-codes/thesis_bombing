n up throughout the regular army, while reserve and Landwehr units were well below the standards acceptable to senior army commanders.24 But the largest problem confronting Hitler was the fact that Germany faced a major European war. The Luftwaffe had not succeeded in deterring the West from honoring its obligations to Poland. Moreover, Hitler had calculated that the combination of the Nazi-Soviet Non Aggression Pact, supplies from the Balkans, and autarkic measures taken in the 1930's would mitigate the effects of an Allied blockade. He had assured his generals before the outbreak of war that Germany had little reason to fear a blockade, since it would "be ineffective due to our autarky and because we have economic resources in the East. We need have no worry. . . . The East will deliver us grain, cattle, coal, lead and zinc."25 Reality, however, proved quite different. Import tonnage fell 57 percent. By January 1940, the value of imports had fallen to RM 186 million as compared to RM 472 million in January 1939, while import tonnage declined from 4,445,000 tons the previous year to 1,122,000 tons. 26 With such problems, the long-term outlook appeared exceedingly dangerous. Moreover, petroleum reserves declined from 2,400,000 tons at the 31   ## p. 32 (#60) ##############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT beginning of the war to 1,600,000 tons in May 1940,27 while gasoline supplies fell from 300,000 tons in September 1939 to 110,000 tons by April 1940.28 This critical economic situation, caused by the outbreak of a wider European war than Hitler had expected, helps to explain an historical puzzle: Why throughout the fall and early winter of 1939 did Hitler push so strongly for an immediate offensive in the west?29 Because of these economic pressures, Hitler felt that the Wehrmacht must move before the economy's difficulties affected German fighting srength. In early October, he warned that time favored Germany's enemies. "The danger, in case of a
