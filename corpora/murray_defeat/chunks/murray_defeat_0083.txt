n providing support to advancing ground forces, and in supplying widely scattered forces.42 No matter what the tactical successes of the Norwegian campaign might have been, the impact of the campaign on Germany's strategic situation was negative both for the short as well as the long haul. In the latter case, Norway proved a strategic drain throughout the Second World War. Moreover, the conquest of the Lorrain ore fields in the campaign against France mitigated the need for Swedish iron ore. Those imports, while useful, were never decisive.43 The short-range strategic impact was even more dubious. By the time that naval operations in Norwegian waters had concluded, the German navy had ceased to exist as an effective surface force. By mid-June, Admiral Erich Raeder, Commander in Chief 35   ## p. 36 (#64) ##############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT of the navy, was down to one heavy cruiser, two light cruisers, and four destroyers; the remainder of the fleet was either at the bottom of the ocean or in drydock undergoing repair.44 The naval staff compounded the inevitable naval losses that went with such a campaign by what can only be categorized as strategic incompetence. In late May and early June, afraid that the war would end before its two battle cruisers had significantly engaged enemy forces, the naval high command risked the Gneisenau and Scharnhorst in strategically pointless operations in northern waters. As a result, both were seriously damaged and did not return to service until December 1940.45 Considering that Raeder had already broached the possibility of an invasion of Britain with the FÃ¼hrer as early as the 20th of May, such a frittering away of naval strength in the north is quite surprising. 46 With initiation of operations against Scandinavia, the Germans completed preparations for a move against the West. On May 10, 1940, the Wehrmacht began an offensive aimed at the strategic overthrow of its opponents. Operations against H
