ionary Force. 48 The French air force, unfortunately, was in great disarray as it was transitioning to a newer generation of aircraft (as had the Luftwaffe in 1937-38 and the RAF in 1938-39 with similar results). The French were, in fact, having considerable difficulty in equipping squadrons with new aircraft as well as maintaining operational ready rates. In early 1940, some French squadrons ran in-commission rates of barely 40 percent, and the pressure of operations only compounded their difficulties.49 The Allies' defeat in the campaign. should not obscure the fact that the French air force fought well, and its experienced pilots, often in inferior equipment, fought tenaciously. 50 36   ## p. 37 (#65) ##############################################  THE EASY WAR: GERMANY TRIUMPHANT The first German air strikes against the Belgians and Dutch virtually eliminated their air forces as possible factors in the campaign; the British and French also suffered heavy aircraft losses on the ground and in the air. But the first day's operations did not come lightly. On May 10, the Germans lost 83 aircraft (not including Ju 52's), including 47 bombers and 25 fighters, equalling the worst losses for a day in the Battle of Britain.

By the 12th, Luftflotte 3 reported general superiority over its opponents, and German aircraft now turned increasingly to attacks on the Allied transportation network and to supporting the advance of ground forces. Reinforcing the impression made by air attacks in the early days of the campaign went the psychological impact of German paratrooper operations. Luftwaffe airborne for
