Above all, the initial strategic goal must aim at the weakening of the morale and actual strength of British 47   ## p. 48 (#76) ##############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT fighter units. Interestingly, Göring suggested that his fighter forces exercise maximum operational latitude, and to this end commanders should not tie them too closely to the bombers. Such a strategy would allow the fighters to use their speed and maneuverability.90 Three days later, Fliegerkorps I delineated four direct missions for the Luftwaffe in the coming battle. The first and most important was to win air superiority by attacks on the RAF and its industrial support, particularly the engine industry; second, to support the Channel crossing by attacks against the enemy fleet and bombers, and eventually through direct aid for the army; third, to attack British ports, supplies, and imports; and finally, independent of the first three tasks, launch ruthless retaliatory terror attacks on major British cities."1 The first phase of the battle, July through early August, involved exploratory operations over the Channel as the Germans, preparing for a major offensive in August, sought to draw Fighter Command out and to close the Channel.
