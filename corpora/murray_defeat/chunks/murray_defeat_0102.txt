The pressure that these attacks placed on the air defense forces has received justifiable attention from historians, and Dowding's conduct of the air battle, supported by the Commander of 11 Group, Keith Park, ranks among the great defensive victories of the war. What has not been so clear is that these air battles placed a comparable, if not greater, strain on the Luftwaffe's resources. For the week beginning with "Eagle Day" on August 13 and ending on August 19, the Germans wrote off approximately 284 aircraft, or 7 percent of their total force structure, or approximately 10 percent of all aircraft deployed in the three air fleets facing Britain as of July 20.97 For August, aircraft losses were 774 from all causes, or 18.5 percent of all combat aircraft available at the beginning of the month. 98 Such a high attrition rate had an obvious impact on crew strength and morale.
