774 from all causes, or 18.5 percent of all combat aircraft available at the beginning of the month. 98 Such a high attrition rate had an obvious impact on crew strength and morale. As Table VII⁹ indicates, pilot losses for August were disproportionately high compared to aircraft losses, undoubtedly reflecting the fact that most of the air fighting occurred over the Channel or British territory.

Not only had the Germans lost many of their most experienced combat crews but by September 1940, the percentage of operational ready crews against authorized aircraft had dropped to an unacceptable level. On September 14, Luftwaffe Bf 109 squadrons possessed only 67 percent operational ready crews against authorized aircraft. For Bf 110 squadrons, the figure was 46 percent; and for bombers, it was 59 percent. One week later, the figures were 64 percent, 52 percent, and 52 percent, respectively. 101 Conversely, aircraft losses for Jul
