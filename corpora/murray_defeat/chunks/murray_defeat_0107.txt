ing those directing the Allied "strategic" bombing campaign of 1943 and 1944. German planners had to decide whether the Luftwaffe should deliver the weight of its attack against a specific segment of British industry such as aircraft factories, or against a system of interrelated industries such as Britain's import and distribution network, or even in a blow aimed at breaking the morale of the British population. The bombing offensive against London, referred to as the Blitz, attempted to achieve simultaneously all three strategies, none of which proved decisive. 107 As with the daylight attacks, the Luftwaffe did not possess the strength or the capabilities to achieve these objectives, but these direct attacks on British military industrial targets and population centers only spurred British desires to repay the Germans in kind, 108 54   ## p. 55 (#83) ##############################################  THE EASY WAR: GERMANY TRIUMPHANT One aspect of the German night bomber offensive deserves closer scrutiny. The : witch to night bombing resulted from a realistic appreciation that German fighters were not sufficiently numerous to protect the bombers from devastating British fighter attacks. The night effort led to a drastic falloff in bomber losses due to combat; and through the winter of 1941, British night fighter and antiaircraft defenses were generally ineffective against German intruders. While combat- related losses were low, the accident rate remained high. Luftwaffe crews flew these combat missions at night and in bad weather, or trained in less-than-perfect conditions to achieve the flying proficiency required. Thus, to list only combat losses considerably understates the attrition taking place. From October to December 1940, bomber losses due to noncombat causes ran well over 50 percent of all losses each month; while for the whole period, 63.5 percent of bomber losses resulted from noncombat causes.
