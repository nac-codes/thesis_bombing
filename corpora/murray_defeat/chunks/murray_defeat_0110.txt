isaster over Schweinfurt in October of 1943 had again underscored the need for long-range fighter support. According to American official historians, such an oversight "is difficult to account for."'115 In one critical respect, however, the British and American air forces drew the correct lesson from the Battle of Britain. Both air forces concluded that the German force structure had been inadequate to meet the demands of the battle. Encouraged by an overestimation of actual German air strength, both air forces set targets for their industrial production and force structure that demanded enormous increases in air strength. Thus, at the same time that the Germans continued a minimum program of air armament, Britain and the United States set in motion preparations that gave them a decisive quantitative edge in the later years of the war. The air struggle of those years, as with the 1940 battles, rested on numbers of aircraft, industrial capacity and production, and availability of trained aircrews. The basis of Allied superiority, thus, would rest on the production programs drawn up in 1940 and 1941 by both sides. 56   ## p. 57 (#85) ##############################################  Notes 1.
