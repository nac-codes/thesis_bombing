(60 percent or greater damage) comes from the loss tables in Mason, Battle Over Britain, pp. 241-43, 247, 263-64, 272-73, 274, 281-84, 286-87; the 7 percent figure represents total Luftwaffe aircraft types involved in the Battle of Britain as of August 10 based on AHB, Translation No. VII/107, “Luftwaffe Strength and Serviceability Tables, August 1938-April 1945"; while the 10 percent figure represents aircraft deployed in the three air fleets as of July 20, Mason, Battle Over Britain, p. 128. 98. Figures based on: AHB, Translation No. VII/107, "Luftwaffe Strength and Serviceability Tables, August 1938-April 1945"; and AHB, Translation VII/83, "German Aircraft Losses, September 1939-December 1940." 99. This table is drawn from the Luftwaffe loss reports in Mason, Battle Over Britain. With the exception of the Bf 109 figures in which, with only a pilot aircrew, losses directly reflect pilot losses, this table estimates pilot losses as pilots are not directly identified among crew losses. The Mason tables only concern air fleets involved in the battle so that losses in the Reich or in OTUS (Operational Training Units) are not counted. The figures for pilots killed, captured, injured, uninjured, or missing are not directly equivalent to aircraft written off since, in some cases, pilots were killed or injured in accidents in which the aircraft was not written off. In other losses, aircraft were destroyed with no aircrew losses involved (i.e., enemy bombing, ground accident). However, since only those pilots who were uninjured returned to duty, the extent of pilot losses is obvious. Finally, the high number of missing aviators indicates that many pilots were captured by the British. 100. Based on figures in the quartermaster returns in BA/MA RL 2 III/708 and 709. 101.
