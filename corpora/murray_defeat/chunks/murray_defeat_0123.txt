With that strange mixture of intuition and ignorance that characterized Hitler's makeup, the Führer urged on his military advisers the possibility of a quick, late summer campaign against the Soviet Union to remove that prop from British policy. His military advisers eventually were able to persuade him that such a campaign, late in the year, made no sense.
