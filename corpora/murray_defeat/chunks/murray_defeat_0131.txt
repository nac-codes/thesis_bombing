Italian collapse and to pin down as many Commonwealth forces as possible; he was notably successful in this endeavor. Moreover, criticism of his capabilities as a strategist missed the point that Rommel never received the resources necessary for a wide ranging strategic campaign. Although Rommel's surge into Egypt in the spring of 1942 was not, as it turns out, capable of overturning Britain's Middle Eastern position, it did manage to unbalance the British so thoroughly that not until the following October were they able to utilize their overwhelming superiority in the theater. For the Luftwaffe, the Mediterranean represented a peripheral theater from January 1941 through the fall of 1942. The Luftwaffe's mission in the Mediterranean largely involved attacks on the island of Malta, support for the Africa Corps, attacks on the British fleet, an increasing commitment to protect the tenuous supply lines between Africa and Europe, and support for the ineffective Italians. As German liaison officers noted early in the war, the Italians had neither the personnel nor the production rate to support a sustained air war. 33 Because the Germans were using a defensive strategy in the Mediterranean, they had to restore order to the Balkans before "Barbarossa" could begin. British aid to Greece, in the form of RAF squadrons, alarmed Hitler who particularly feared air attacks on the oil fields and refineries of Rumania.34 Further Wehrmacht deployments into Rumania in the late fall initiated preparations both for "Barbarossa" and the elimination of Greece as an opponent.

Moreover, Bulgaria, worried about Turkey, hesitated to allow German troops access to its territory. Not until the end of February did the Germans assuage Bulgarian fears, and only on March 1 did their troops cross t
