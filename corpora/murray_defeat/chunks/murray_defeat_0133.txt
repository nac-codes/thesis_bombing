as possible." The Luftwaffe's first objective would be: "As soon as sufficient forces are available and the weather allows, the ground installations of the Yugoslav air force and the city of Belgrade will be destroyed from the air by continual day and night attacks [my emphasis]."'37 German military planning exhibited its usual adaptability to changing circumstances. As Halder admitted later, the OKH had already prepared the theoretical groundwork for an attack on Yugoslavia; all that remained was to solve the practical difficulties of moving troops and supplies for the expanded campaign. 38 In little more than a week after the coup, the Germans had altered Twelfth Army's dispositions in Bulgaria to include Yugoslavia in its mission and had established the Second Army in southern Austria and Hungary along the Yugoslav frontier. Armored forces from the two armies, one advancing from the north and the other from the south, would strike deep into Yugoslavia at Belgrade. Meanwhile, Twelfth Army would bypass Greek defenses by swinging through Yugoslavia to take the Greeks in the flanks and rear.39 Along with these new deployments went an extensive redeployment of the Luftwaffe. Nearly 600 aircraft moved from various bases within the Reich to support the extension of the campaign to Yugoslavia; some units were deployed from bases as far away as southern France. Luftwaffe strength for the coming offensive now exceeded 1,000 aircraft. 40 The reasons behind such a drastic increase in aircraft strength become readily apparent in reviewing the orders directing the air attacks on Yugoslavia. The campaign's strategic plan specifically excluded bombing either industrial plants or the transportation network, since the Germans hoped to utilize the Yugoslav economy as soon as possible for their own needs. However, the major task, concurrent with achieving air superiority, was "the destruction of Belgrade through a great air attack." That attack would begin in the morning with a dir
