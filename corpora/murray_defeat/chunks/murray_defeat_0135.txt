ritish troops before German armor could cut off their escape.45 There was one climactic clash to the campaign. On May 20, German airborne forces dropped on Crete. However, they met an unexpectedly warm reception. In fact, on the basis of the first day's operation, it looked as if the Germans might fail entirely. Not only did the paratroopers not capture a landing strip but the survivors were isolated and under great pressure. Only faulty leadership and coordination around the Malene airfield allowed the Germans to seize that airbase and to fly in reinforcements. Air superiority gave the paratroopers critical support and prevented the Royal Navy from bringing to bear its full weight." Despite the successful outcome, the Germans indeed had received a bloody nose in Crete. Altogether, their losses totalled nearly 4,000 men or one-quarter of the attacking force. Out of the 500 transport aircraft, the Luftwaffe had to write off 146 as total losses, while a further 150 were damaged.47 Because of the operation's high cost, Hitler considered the day of large paratrooper operations as finished. In retrospect, the Balkan campaign was only a footnote in the war. It did not significantly postpone the invasion of Russia. The delay in the Russian campaign resulted more from supply and organizational difficulties and poor ground and weather conditions associated with the late spring than from the attack on Greece and Yugoslavia.48 At the most, Balkan operations affected the freshness and staying power of units transferred from operations in the south to the Russian campaign. Ironically, the campaign in the Balkans succeeded too well. The advance of armored spearheads had been so quick and the collapse so sudden that the Germans were not able to round up thousands of Greek and Yugoslav soldiers left in the backwater areas of those countries. Rapid redeployment of German units to "Barbarossa" assignments allowed those soldiers to roam the countryside; they soon formed the basis for
