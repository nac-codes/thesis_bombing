soldiers left in the backwater areas of those countries. Rapid redeployment of German units to "Barbarossa" assignments allowed those soldiers to roam the countryside; they soon formed the basis for the considerable guerilla movements throughout the area. By 1942, these guerrillas were tying down large numbers of Germans and were preventing the Reich from fully utilizing the resources of the southern Balkans. For the Luftwaffe, the spring of 1941 offered the last easy campaign. Nevertheless, even before "Barbarossa," aircraft losses were rising ominously. Operations in the Balkans, as well as an increased effort against British cities to disguise the redeployment to the east, pushed the loss rate (all aircraft) from 2.6 percent (written off) in January 1941 to 7.2 percent in April, and to 7.5 percent in May.49 The loss rate for bombers (written off) climbed in the same period from 4.8 percent in January, to 5.5 percent in February, to 8.6 percent in March, to 10.6 76   ## p. 77 (#105) #############################################  THE TURN TO RUSSIA percent in April, and to 12 percent in May. Thus, the strain on resources was already mounting before operations in the east began. Furthermore, official German reaction among the ruling hierarchy to the loss rate suggests a general indifference to the potential impact that such losses might have in sustained combat operations in Russia.

In effect, Germany's leadership had sealed her fate before the campaign opened. Hitler had turned to
