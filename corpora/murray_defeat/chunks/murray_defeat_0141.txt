Günther Blumentritt could claim in 1941 that "Russian military history shows that the Russian as a combat soldier, illiterate and half-Asiatic, thinks and feels differently. "'60 Given such attitudes, it is not surprising that many German soldiers, as well as their leader, expected that once they kicked in the door, the structure-ruled by Jewish subhumans-would collapse. 61 One of the more glaring defects in mapping out the preinvasion strategy was the scant attention the Germans paid to the logistical difficulties of supporting troops deep inside Russia. The general assumption seems to have been that the first great rush of mechanized forces would carry to Smolensk and destroy the Red Army in the border areas. Thereafter, depending on railroads, German troops would exploit the initial success to finish the campaign. Surprisingly, the units scheduled to repair railroads leading to Smolensk lay at the bottom of army priorities-a reflection of an unduly optimistic approach to logistics. 62 Compounding this casual attitude towards logistics was the failure to appreciate the distances involved in traversing Russia. The push to Smolensk and from there to Moscow represented a logistical problem on a vastly different scale from the campaign in the west against France. For the Luftwaffe, the awesome geographic size of Russia presented comparable logistical difficulties. What is more, the major commitments occupying the air force from June 1940 on had allowed almost none of the periods of rest the army had enjoyed to conserve and rebuild strength. Göring claimed after the war that he had opposed the invasion; but his remarks to General Georg Thomas, head of the OKW's economic section, that such a war was simply a "problem of the necessary supply organization" suggests that he was as overconfident as the rest. 63 Hitler's Directive #21 stressed that the Luftwaffe's first task was to eliminate the Russian air force and to prevent it from interfering with the advance on the gr
