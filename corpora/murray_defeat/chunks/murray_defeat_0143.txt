The OKL (Oberkommando der Luftwaffe, German air force high command) detailed three air fleets to cooperate directly with the three army groups in the subjugation of the Soviet Union. Two thousand seven hundred seventy aircraft, or 65 percent of the frontline strength of the Luftwaffe, moved east against the Russians; through the spring of 1943, the bulk of the Luftwaffe would remain tied to the eastern front.67 Facing the Germans was a Soviet air force estimated at 8,000 aircraft, with somewhere around 6,000 deployed in European Russia. 68 Like the army, the Luftwaffe believed that after the first day's operations had broken the back of the Soviet air forces, the Russians would not recover.

Their enormous tactical successes through the fall of 1941 were as much the result of Stalin's incompetence as of German military brilliance. In his search for internal security, the soviet dictator had quite literally destroyed his arm
