The intensive fighting made heavy demands on ammunition stocks of divisions in the forward lines so that the transportation system had to bring up ammunition, and thus there was no opportunity to stockpile fuel for the next advance. 85 By July 23, Halder admitted that the existing situation where frontline units were living a "hand-to-mouth" existence in terms of their supplies was making it impossible to build up stockpiles for the next push. 86 Thus, the infamous August pause during which the German army remained virtually stationary at Smolensk and in the north resulted not only from disagreements within the high command as to the next objective and the need to refresh exhausted mechanized units but also from a logistical system that could
