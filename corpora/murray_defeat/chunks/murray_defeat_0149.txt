Russians possessed strategic depth; and even if they had not fully utilized it in the first months, it was an inevitable strategic advantage. For the Luftwaffe, these same factors were operative. The deeper that flying units moved into Russia, the more precarious became their supply situation. By mid- July, air units were crying for fuel and ammunition; and within the jumble moving forward to support the spearheads, the Luftwaffe's logistical system functioned no more efficiently than that of the army. Fliegerkorps VIII reported as early as July 5 that fuel was lacking even though the corps had already limited its missions. 83   ## p. 84 (#112) #############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT Laconically, Richthofen noted: "Supply is for us the greatest difficulty in this war.''89 The funnel-shaped nature of the theater also operated against the Luftwaffe. As the Wehrmacht moved deeper into Russia, the front widened. As a result, the Luftwaffe had to cover greater distances with forces that weakened as losses mounted. Moreover, as the army spread out, the tendency became more pronounced to use air units as fire brigades to patch up frontline difficulties. Air force commanders were not necessarily happy with such a state of affairs but often had no choice other than to use their air resources to support the army.90 This should not suggest that the Luftwaffe involved itself solely in aiding ground forces. In late July with the seizure of bases near Smolensk, it launched major raids against the Russian capital. Richthofen, Commander of Fliegerkorps VIII, expected great results from these attacks and noted hopefully on July 13 that the first massed attack (erster grosser Angriff) on Moscow "could cause a catastrophe. All the experts calculate that a famine exists in the 4 million population of the capital."92 When transferred to the north in August, Richthofen ordered a firebomb attack on Leningrad; the next day, he noted that two small and one large
