In this period supporting the advance of one army corps, Fliegerkorps VIII lost 10.3 percent of its aircraft (destroyed or written off as the result of operations), with 54.5 percent of its aircraft damaged but reparable. During this action, the air corps had 3.9 percent of its flying personnel killed, 5.7 percent wounded, and 2.9 percent listed as missing for a 12.5 percent total casualty rate.94 Aiding the Luftwaffe in its support of the army's advance was the flexible supply and maintenance system already discussed in relation to the French campaign. Units moved forward rapidly behind advancing spearheads; and as the campaign's emphasis shifted from one front to another, bomber and fighter units moved swiftly to new bases and areas of operation. Such flexibility allowed the Luftwaffe to give maximum support to the armored drives and helped the army push ever deeper into Russian territory." Nevertheless, the continual movement of units across the Russian landscape was not without cost. These shifts strained the maintenance and supply system to the breaking point so that by late fall 1941, operational aircraft ready rates were way down, thereby having a negative impact on the whole force structure.
