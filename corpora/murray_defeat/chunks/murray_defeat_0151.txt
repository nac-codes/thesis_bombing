By the end of the winter, 1 million civilians within Leningrad had died of famine. In the south, a more immediate disaster threatened the Russians. Thanks largely to Stalin's military ineptitude, Guderian's Panzer Group 2 broke loose from the central front and drove almost straight south to link up with General Ewald von Kleist's Panzer Group 1.97 Behind the encompassing arms of the panzer armies lay a vast pocket of Soviet troops around Kiev. By the time that cleanup operations had ended, the Germans claimed to have taken 655,000 prisoners. The Soviets asserted after the war that only 677,000 Russian soldiers had been in the region at the end of August and that 150,000 managed to escape before resistance collapsed.98 The figures are meaningless; they can only symbolize a human tragedy of unimaginable extent. What is clear is that the Germans had torn to ribbons the entire southern theater of operations; German troops could now move forward as fast as their vehicles, supplies, and weather conditions would permit.
