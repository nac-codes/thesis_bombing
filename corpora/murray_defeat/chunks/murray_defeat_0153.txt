By October 6, Bryansk had fallen, and Russian command and control over the entire central front collapsed. 101 The advance came so swiftly and the collapse so suddenly that Moscow received its first indications of disaster through Hitler's speech on October 5 that spoke of a "final decisive offensive." The Russians had no specific knowledge of what Hitler was speaking except for the fact that communications no longer existed with the Western Army Group. 102 On October 5, Russian reconnaissance pilots reported a German armored column some 25 kilometers long advancing on the great highway from Smolensk to Moscow. Despite efforts by the NKVD (Soviet Secret Police) to arrest the pilots as "panic mongers," their reports gave Moscow its first indication of the extent of the collapse. 103 The Germans had ripped open Soviet frontlines from Bryansk to Vyazma and were encircling two vast groupings of Russian armies: the first of three armies around Bryansk and the second of five armies around Vyazma. Officially, the Germans claimed 658,000 prisoners in the double encirclements. 104 Again, the totals are meaningless.
