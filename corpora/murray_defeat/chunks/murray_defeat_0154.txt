From a level of over 1,000 sorties per day before the onset of bad weather, the sortie rate fell to 559 on October 8 and to 269 on the 9th. 107 The threat to Moscow persuaded Stalin to bring Marshal Georgi Zhukov from Leningrad to defend the capital. With a firm hand in control, the Soviets reknit their defenses with surprising swiftness as the enemy advance bogged down in autumn mud. Nevertheless, the onset of bad weather should not obscure the fact that there was nothing unusual about such weather; if anything, the period of mud lasted for a shorter period than usual. 108 In retrospect, the Germans should have shut down the campaign after the victory of Bryansk/Vyazma. The supply situation had become so difficult that barely enough resupply got through to keep the advance moving. Consequently, there was no leeway to build up reserves or to send forward the critical winter clothing and equipment that the troops would desperately need when winter struck. 109 The offensive continued. The German high command, in the face of steadily worsening weather, turned reality upside down. It would push the last battalion of reserves into the front.
