ging operations deep behind Moscow for which neither troops nor supplies existed. This undoubtedly resulted from a poor appreciation for condition in the field that, in turn, led to a general overconfidence as to the capabilities of German forces and a complete underestimation of Russian forces. For the frontline troops advancing under dreadful conditions, Hitler's overconfidence showed itself not only in impossible demands but with the mid-November withdrawal of much of Luftflotte 2 for service in the Mediterranean. Thus, support for the drive on Moscow almost entirely devolved on the shoulders of Richthofen's Fliegerkorps VIII.112 At the beginning of November, the arrival of cold weather brought an end to the mud, and the advance began again.

Militia units, divisions pulled from quiet segments of the front, and Siberian reinforcements trundled through Moscow in a desperate effort to keep the Germans at bay outside the capital.
