calate the Luftwaffe's involvement had a synergistic effect that placed the Luftwaffe in a precarious situation by the winter of 1941-42. Moreover, these interrelated factors largely determined the Luftwaffe's fate in the upcoming air battles of 1943 and 1944. The greatest strain on the Luftwaffe in 1941 resulted from operations conducted in the east beginning on June 22. Unlike the Battle of France or the Battle of Britain, attrition in Russia involved low loss rates combined with sustained operations over an extended period. The cumulative effect of these small "acceptable" losses was no less decisive in its impact than was the Battle of Britain. Table XIII¹¹5 gives a detailed picture of the cumulative impact of those losses through the fall of 1941 on the eastern front.

Due to the "Blitz" against the British Isles in the winter of 1941, the Balkan campaign, and air commitments in the Mediterranean as well as "Barbarossa," the Luftwaffe had gone through its entire inventory of aircraft in just twelve months.
