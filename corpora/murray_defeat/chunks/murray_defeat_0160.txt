By February, the quartermaster general no longer knew how many aircraft he would receive due to chaotic conditions in the aircraft industry. 120 Thus, by late winter, the general staff could not accurately forecast either how many aircraft or crews the Luftwaffe would receive in the next month, not to mention succeeding months. 121 From this point forward, the staff would squeeze out of industry and out of transition schools as much as possible each month and shove new crews with decreasing skill levels and new aircraft into the frontline units. Compounding the difficulties was a supply and maintenance system that revealed little capacity for functioning over the long distances that the Luftwaffe now covered. What had sufficed within the limited frontiers of prewar Germany could not meet the needs of an air force committed from the Bay of Biscay to the gates of Moscow and from the North Cape to North Africa. The supply system, particularly in Russia, no longer functioned effectively. Milch in a visit to the eastern front discovered that hundreds of inoperable aircraft were lying about on forward airfields. They had either broken down or been damaged in combat, and spare parts were not flowing forward to repair these aircraft. 122 Because supply and maintenan
