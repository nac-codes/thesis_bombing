fully minimizing their exposure to hazardous missions. Then as experience increased, squadrons assigned the pilots to more dangerous tasks until they were fully combat-ready. 125 Such a system was undoubtedly the only one that frontline units could follow given the state of pilot 94   ## p. 95 (#123) #############################################  THE TURN TO RUSSIA TABLE XVIII LUFTWAFFE "IN-COMMISSION" RATES 1941 ALL AIRCRAFT- BOMBERS FIGHTERS 80% 75% 75% 73% 740% 730Â° 71% 68% 70% 69% 67% 68% 68% 67% 66% 65% 66% 62% 62% 60% 63% 62% 62% 60% 62% 57% 52% 58% 57% 54% 52% 52% 52% 50% 50% 40% 53% 45% 45% 38% 30% 32% JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC 1203 95   ## p. 96 (#124) #############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT training. It had, however, two pernicious side effects. The first was that it maximized the exposure to danger of experienced aircrews, thus increasing their losses. This, in turn, led to higher percentages of untrained or partially trained personnel in the combat units. The second, and equally disastrous, effect was that untrained pilots in the dangerous and primitive conditions of frontline airfields had a higher accident rate than normal. The normal rate was high enough given a lax attitude towards flying safety throughout the war. 126 But the combination of a weak flying safety program along with untrained and unskilled pilots flying off primitive airstrips was deadly. As Table XVII indicates, the Luftwaffe was destroying three of its own aircraft for every four destroyed by the enemy, and the number of damaged aircraft from noncombat accidents was an intolerable burden on an already overstrained maintenance system. The attrition over the summer and fall of 1941 led to a steady deterioration in the experience level of aircrews. From the summer of 1941, the Luftwaffe entered a period in which losses proceeded at such a pace that a recovery in terms of crew flying experience could only come with a long halt to operation
