Rather, the Germans now allowed themselves to be deluded by the speed of the first victories over Poland and France into believing that they could continue armament production at the prevailing low level. The overconfidence marking the approach to "Seal Lion" and "Barbarossa" were symptomatic of a wider malaise: Nothing was impossibe for the rulers of the Third Reich! The issue here is not that the Germans built tanks or artillery pieces at the expense of aircraft, but rather they made minimal alterations 96   ## p. 97 (#125) #############################################  THE TURN TO RUSSIA TABLE XIX % OF FULLY OPERATIONAL CREWS JULY 1941 - JANUARY 1942 ALL AIRCREWS FIGHTER PILOTS 75% 74.9% BOMBER CREWS 70% 67.7% 65.5% 67.9% 67.5% 60.3% 64.4% 59.6% 60% 59.6% 56.5% 54.8% 53% 53.9% 50% 49.6% 45.4% 52% 47.2% 40% JULY AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC JAN 1387 97   ## p. 98 (#126) #############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT in the production of all major weapon systems after the fall of France in spite of a radically different raw material and industrial situation. Symptomatic of this situation in the summer of 1940 was the Army ordnance office's rejection of Hitler's proposal that tank production be increased from 100 to 800 per month because such a level would be too expensive and require too many skilled workers.129 But as late as February 1941, a major economic journal noted that "Germany is entering the final struggle with so overwhelming a superiority of armament capacity that the result can no longer be in doubt.' 130 Certainly, the losses in tanks and aircraft in the French campaign should have raised serious doubts as to existing rates of production; the same could be said for the Battle of Britain. However, no one in the Luftwaffe, with the possible exception of Milch, became particularly worried over the continuing lag in production. Only the failure of the Russian campaign spurred Hi
