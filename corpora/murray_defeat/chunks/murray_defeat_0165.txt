Britain. However, no one in the Luftwaffe, with the possible exception of Milch, became particularly worried over the continuing lag in production. Only the failure of the Russian campaign spurred Hitler to reorganize the economy prompting a dramatic expansion of production. Nevertheless, the Führer himself was not completely at fault, since few senior officials had pushed for major increases in production. Further complicating a rational utilization of Europe's economic resources were the ideological perceptions of the German leadership. Göring indicated the ideological basis coloring the Nazi approach to economic problems when he stated in 1942: Basically, I consider all of occupied France as a conquered country. It seems to me that in earlier times the thing was simpler. In earlier times, you pillaged. He who had conquered a country disposed of the riches of that country. At present, things are done in a more humane way. As for myself, I still think of pillage comprehensively. The problem was that such an approach was counterproductive. Göring's positions in the Reich (as the Air Minister and Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe, as Minister of the Four-Year Plan, and as a leading confidant of the Führer) increased the probability that his views guided German economic policy. Thus, exploitation of the French economy involved a looting expedition in which competing military authorities (in France the army got the largest share of the loot as its troops were first on the scene), civil authorities, and industrial firms divided the booty. Captured raw materials went straight to the Reich along with considerable numbers of machine tools. 132 In the latter case, such transfers made no economic sense, 133 for the movement of machine tools to Germany could not possibly increase productive capacity as the aircraft industry was already underutilized with most factories on 8- hour shifts, once a day. The looted machine tools went into storage facilities. Ironically, under t
