ase productive capacity as the aircraft industry was already underutilized with most factories on 8- hour shifts, once a day. The looted machine tools went into storage facilities. Ironically, under the pressure of Allied air attacks in 1943 and 1944, the Germans attempted to disperse the aircraft industry into occupied countries; the looting of 1940 and 1941, however, proved a severe hindrance as many tools were no longer available. 134 Moreover, the failure to use factories in occupied countries in 1941 and 98   ## p. 99 (#127) #############################################  THE TURN TO RUSSIA 1942 meant that when the Germans reopened plants, they discovered machinery and facilities in poor condition. The badly thought-out looting of occupied countries stands in contrast to the occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939. When the Germans seized Prague in March 1939, economic authorities refused to allow the transfer of raw material stockpiles to the Reich, since this would allow Germany to maintain Czech production and to utilize Czechoslovakia's industrial potential to the fullest. They were correct in that assumption, for not only did Czech industry substantially aid German armament but it also earned substantial foreign exchange up to the outbreak of war. 135 Similarly, the Luftwaffe found Czechoslovakia extremely useful in supporting its own production plans. By the end of 1939, Udet had placed orders for 1,797 Czech aircraft. Indeed, the Czech aircraft industry proved useful in serving its new masters. 136 In the case of France, however, things worked out quite differently. In all of 1941, the French aircraft industry produced only 62 aircraft for the Luftwaffe (Holland only 16), while Czech plants produced 819.137 The reason is quite apparent. In the case of Czechoslovakia, the Germans were still in a difficult strategic and economic situation, and they, therefore, eagerly incorporated Czech potential into their economic system.
