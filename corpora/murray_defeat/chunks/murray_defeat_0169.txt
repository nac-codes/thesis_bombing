s, even before the war the plans of the general staff and of Udet's production planners had diverged. Now in a war in which Luftwaffe commitments were widening, production figures remained virtually stationary. Table XX142 indicates the extent of Germany's aircraft production. TABLE XX Production of German Aircraft-1939-1941 Fighters Bombers Transports Trainers Others Total 1939 1,856 2,877 1,037 1,112 1,413 8,295 1940 3,106 3,997 763 1,328 1,632 10,826 1941 3,732 4,350 969 889 1,836 11,776 The impact of these levels of aircraft production on frontline units became obvious as the war continued. German industry was not producing aircraft at a rate sufficient to replace losses at the front and in accidents. As a result, the difference between the number of aircraft authorized and actually present increased as operations attrited frontline strength. In September 1939, combat units had possessed virtually a full complement of aircraft. As production failed to keep up with loss rates, it became ever more difficult to sustain authorized levels, and even the most favored organizations had to operate well below authorized strength (see Table XXIÂ¹43). 100   ## p. 101 (#129) ############################################  THE TURN TO RUSSIA TABLE XXI Authorized Actual Strength, Combat Aircraft- September 1939-March 1942 Authorized Actual Percent of Authorized Aircraft September 1939 2,950 2,916 98.9 December 1939 3,313 3,258 98.3 March 1940 4,034 3,692 91.5 June 1940 3,714 3,327 89.6 September 1940 3,547 3,015 85.0 December 1940 3,792 3,050 80.4 March 1941 4,100 3,853 94.0 June 1941 4,228 3,451 81.6 September 1941 4,318 3,561 82.5 December 1941 4,344 2,749 63.3 March 1942 4,623 2,876 62.2 When combined with the operational ready rates for late 1941, the figures in Table XXI present a thoroughly depressing picture of the Luftwaffe's combat strength. One aircraft type in particular, the bomber, had reached the point where the Luftwaffe had hardly any capability left. In December
