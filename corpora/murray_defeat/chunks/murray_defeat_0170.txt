a thoroughly depressing picture of the Luftwaffe's combat strength. One aircraft type in particular, the bomber, had reached the point where the Luftwaffe had hardly any capability left. In December 1941, the bomber force possessed only 47.1 percent of its authorized strength; only 51 percent of that force was in commission. Thus, from an authorized strength of 1,950 bombers, the Luftwaffe had only 468 in commission on December 6, 1941, or 24 percent of authorized aircraft. 144 The cause of this shortfall lay directly at the door of Udet's poor administration, with a sizeable portion of the blame also to be shared among Göring, Jeschonnek, and the aircraft industry. Udet had possessed neither the capability nor background to assume responsibility for technical development and production. At one point, he admitted that he understood nothing of industrial processes and even less about the engineering of large aircraft. 145 The result of such a situation was that for a three-year period, the Air Ministry provided little leadership or guidance to manufacturers. Udet's offices became involved in producing a series of production plans that bore no relationship to what was occurring in industry. After each demand for an increase in production, his staff invariably revised downwards plans to reflect the results. 146 Moreover, introduction of new aircraft types or new models of existing aircraft "meant that the large planned increases were subject to sudden and sharp revision downwards, even when strategy demanded otherwise."'147 Yet, the top leadership also bears responsibility for the production crisis of 1941. Hitler, despite occasional interest in technical matters, intervened hardly at all in Luftwaffe production during the early war years. Contrary to his relations with the army, Hitler delegated much authority over air force matters to Göring; and while he did set industrial priorities, he was poorly informed about what was going on with Luftwaffe production.
