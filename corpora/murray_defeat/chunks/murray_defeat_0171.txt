he army, Hitler delegated much authority over air force matters to Göring; and while he did set industrial priorities, he was poorly informed about what was going on with Luftwaffe production. While it suited Göring to keep the Führer uninformed, he himself also possessed little knowledge through the spring of 1941 of what was happening. Udet did provide a scapegoat for subsequent production failures, 148 but 101   ## p. 102 (#130) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT Göring and his staff deserve a full measure of blame for their concurrence with production levels during this period. The crisis came to a head in the summer of 1941. Udet's office could no longer hide the growing disparity between planned and actual production totals when Luftwaffe strength in the field reached scandalously low levels. To help overcome this industrial shortfall, Göring reinserted Milch into the production process. Shortly before the beginning of "Barbarossa," Göring granted the State Secretary wide powers over the aircraft industry that included the right to close or to requisition factories, to confiscate raw materials, to transfer or dismiss designers, and in general to reorganize industrial production. As with previous orders from the Reichsmarschall, Milch was to quadruple production. 149 This time, however, Göring had given the brief to a man who did understand modern production methods and industrial practices. 150 Over the summer of 1941, Milch supplanted Udet and assumed control of the technical offices that Udet had controlled. 151 The gradual exclusion of Udet from the centers of power within the Air Ministry as well as Milch's less-than-tactful behavior contributed to the former's suicide in the fall of 1941. Undoubtedly, the nightmarish situation that Milch discovered in industry and within these offices contributed to Udet's death. But before his death, Udet, with Milch's backing, produced a plan in July 1941 calling for a radical restructurin
