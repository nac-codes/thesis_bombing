system. Right through 1944, German aircraft possessed the finest upholstered crew seats; thousands of man-hours were wasted in machining bulkheads and minor fittings, while parts taking no strain or requiring no precision were finished to close tolerances. The completed aircraft represented a finely 102   ## p. 103 (#131) ############################################  THE TURN TO RUSSIA finished product compared to their American and British counterparts; but where there were hundreds of the latter, one found only tens of the former. 157 One of the major excuses that aircraft manufacturers had presented for the low rate of aircraft production in the first war years was a lack of raw materials, especially in the light metals sector so essential to an increase in production. Sending out inspectors to check on industrial procedures, Milch discovered widespread waste of raw materials throughout the aircraft industry: The production of one type aircraft engine was wasting approximately 1,500 pounds of aluminum. Moreover, industry had built up large stockpiles, and Messerschmitt factories were even using aluminum to build tropical shelters and ladders for use in vineyards. 158 Milch was able to put a stop to many of these practices, and it was soon apparent to those in charge of the aircraft industry that a firm hand had now grasped control. The change of responsibility within the Air Ministry had, fortunately for Germany's opponents, come too late. For 1941, the Western Powers had outproduced Germany's aircraft industry by a wide margin (see Tables XXII, 159 XXIII, 160 and XXIV 161). In fighters alone, Anglo-American production totals for the last quarter of 1941 were nearly 400 percent greater than Germany's; in twin-engine aircraft, the lead was 169 percent; and in four-engine aircraft, a whopping 4,033 percent. 162 The levels for 1941, however, only reflected a small portion of Germany's problem. The British and Americans had been planning major increases in productio
