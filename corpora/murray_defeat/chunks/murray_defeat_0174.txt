gine aircraft, a whopping 4,033 percent. 162 The levels for 1941, however, only reflected a small portion of Germany's problem. The British and Americans had been planning major increases in production since the summer of 1940. Considering the potential of American industry, those preparations had been on a far grander scale than Germany could ever consider. Now in the summer of 1941, the Germans began to change their approach, but it was only after Udet's suicide in November 1941 that Milch gained general authority. Most of the leadership remained blissfully ignorant of the terrible danger facing the Reich. With great glee, Goebbels recorded every Anglo-American disaster in early 1942, while dismissing as idle Yankee boasting the American production figures. 163 GÃ¶ring casually replied to warnings of the industrial potential of the United States that Americans "could only produce cars and refrigerators."164 The German Embassy in Washington sent a number of warnings during 1940 that while America's national defense was still woefully lacking in nearly every respect, production would represent a serious threat by 1941 and increasingly each year thereafter. The cautionary forebodings made little impression. 165 Milch was not so sanguine having seen American industry at work,166 but only in late 1941 had he gained full control of aircraft production. CONCLUSION For the second year in a row, the Luftwaffe had lost nearly its entire complement of aircraft.
