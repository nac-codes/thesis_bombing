(See Table XXV.2) Although the German air force faced critical deployments and tasks elsewhere, the bulk of German aircraft remained in the east until events in the fall required shifts in air resources. The war in the east in the summer of 1942 superficially resembled the swift advance of 1941 with a rapid surge towards the Caucasus and Stalingrad, but inherent supply and maintenance difficulties intensified as the Luftwaffe operated from bases deep inside Russia and far from its sources of supply. Moreover, the attrition that had occurred during 1941 forced the Luftwaffe to operate with considerably less effectiveness because of less well-trained crews than it had in 1941. Finally, one must note that geographic and climatic problems, complicated by difficulties facing ground forces that were outnumbered and losing their qualitative superiority, precluded the Luftwaffe from developing any new role in the east other than helping extricate the army out of increasingly dangerous situations. Perhaps, considering the balance of f
