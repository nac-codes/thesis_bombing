tive superiority, precluded the Luftwaffe from developing any new role in the east other than helping extricate the army out of increasingly dangerous situations. Perhaps, considering the balance of forces in the east, ground and air, there was no other choice. Overall, Luftwaffe attrition rates for the year showed an alarming rise over those of 1941 (see Tables XXVI,³ XXVII,4 and XXVIII³). As indicated in Chapter III, the German failure in front of Moscow in December 1941 and Russian counterattacks provoked a crisis in the German high command and threatened the collapse of the eastern front. The Russian counteroffensive caught the Germans on the point of final exhaustion, short of supplies, and with few preparations to meet the winter weather. Hitler excused his and the high command's culpability by claiming that severe winter weather had come surprisingly early," but such claims did little to help troops that were fighting in temperatures 20° below zero. As the collapse threatened to become general, the Führer sacked Brauchitsch and other senior commanders and assumed the position of Commander in Chief of the army himself." Weather conditions accelerated the attrition of men through frostbite and of equipment through cold. By December 16, Panzer Group 2 was down to 40 tanks in operable condition. Sixth Panzer Division possessed only 350 riflemen and no tanks by the 13th, while 7th Panzer Division had a combat strength of barely 200 men. In such conditions, Russian attacks threatened to destroy the army in the east. This eventuality did not occur for two reasons. The first was that the vast blood letting of the summer and fall had left the Russian army with limited resources to achieve its objectives. The second factor dovetailed with the first.
