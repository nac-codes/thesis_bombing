condition moved with great difficulty through drifting snows. Railroad authorities warned Army Group Center that in temperatures below -15Â° Centigrade, over 50 percent of its supplies would not get through, and in heavy snow the entire supply system might cease to function.11 Yet despite the desperate situation, the Germans held the critical points and prevented a general collapse. In February 1942, the Russians opened a hundred- mile gap between Army Group North and Army Group Center. Russian forces failed to exploit their advantage, however, and the Germans escaped the full consequences of the breakthrough. Nevertheless, this time the Red Army managed to isolate two pockets of German troops: the first of approximately brigade strength around Kholm, the second containing the better part of two army corps (six divisions with 100,000 men) near Demyansk. 12 Hitler ordered the forces trapped to hold in what was optimistically termed the Demyansk "fortress."'13 The responsibility for resupplying the beseiged forces fell on the Luftwaffe's already overburdened shoulders. By the time that the spring thaw arrived in late March, the immediate crisis was over. Both sides wearily faced each other with armies that had fought themselves to exhaustion. Attrition of the German army, however, insured that it would never again reach the level of efficiency that it had displayed at the beginning of "Barbarossa." On March 25, 1942, Halder recorded German losses in the east as 32,485 officers and 1,040,581 NCOs, and men from forces that had numbered 3.2 million at the start of the invasion (33.52 percent). 14 This total did not include those reporting sick. Considering that these totals included support troops, attrition of combat units had undoubtedly exceeded 50 percent. Equipment losses were on a similar scale. By March 1942, tank losses had reached 3,486 from a tank force numbering 3,350 in June 1941, and which had received only 873 replacement tanks.15 Not surprisingly, the numbe
