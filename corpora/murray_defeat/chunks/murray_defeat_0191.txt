s were on a similar scale. By March 1942, tank losses had reached 3,486 from a tank force numbering 3,350 in June 1941, and which had received only 873 replacement tanks.15 Not surprisingly, the number of tanks ready for action on the eastern front on March 30, 1942, was 140.16 Losses in artillery, trucks, and support vehicles were comparable. The winter crisis only intensified Luftwaffe problem areas (inadequate production and maintenance, and declining crew capabilities). The failure to defeat Russia, unlike the situation the previous year, meant that the Luftwaffe faced inescapable commitments with no possibility of a lull in operations during which it could rehabilitate exhausted flying units. Generally, however, the Luftwaffe was better prepared for cold weather than the army. The air transport system enabled it to evade supply bottlenecks and to move winter clothing forward to its units in Russia. Nevertheless, the weather was no kinder to the Luftwaffe's ground transportation system; by January 1942, only 15 percent of the 100,000 air force vehicles in the 118   ## p. 119 (#147) ############################################  ON THE BRINK east remained in working condition." Vehicle shortages forced some units to use shovels and peasant sleds to clear snow from airfields. The cold itself presented numerous problems from starting aircraft to performing simple maintenance. Mechanics had to preheat tools before beginning work and repeat the heating operation several times thereafter while working in the open. 18 Special weather conditions in Russia demanded special procedures and the development of specific equipment items, most of which could not be available until the following winter. Moreover, the army's plight forced air force commanders to commit their resources to aid frontline crises, while heavy losses of artillery increased demands for close air support. The fact that the Luftwaffe possessed few ground support aircraft led to the use of bombers in this r
