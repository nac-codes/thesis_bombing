to aid frontline crises, while heavy losses of artillery increased demands for close air support. The fact that the Luftwaffe possessed few ground support aircraft led to the use of bombers in this role, thus increasing their loss rate. This tactical misuse of bombers continued unabated throughout the war, but the imperatives of the ground situation often offered no other choice. Not only was this an inefficient use of aircraft but each bomber loss involved the wastage of more crew, more instruments, more engines, and more raw materials than in the case of a single-engine ground attack aircraft. 19 In the desperate battles on the eastern front, Luftwaffe antiaircraft units, especially those equipped with 88mm antiaircraft guns, played a valuable part in fighting Russian tanks. Because partisan activity made rear areas insecure and Russian breakthroughs threatened forward operating fields, the Luftwaffe used support and staff personnel in January 1942 to defend airfields. But what was defensible as necessity soon became indefensible as common practice. Deciding that the Luftwaffe was overmanned with maintenance and support personnel, Göring ordered establishment of Luftwaffe field divisions for frontline service. Led by untrained officers and NCOs, such units suffered disproportionately heavy casualties. Moreover, such shortsightedness, which characterized so much of the Luftwaffe's approach, resulted in the enlistment of maintenance and service troops for duty as frontline riflemen.20 Thus, at the same time that Milch and his staff prepared for a rapid expansion in aircraft strength, Göring was squandering the expertise of trained technicians who already were having difficulty in keeping sufficient numbers of Luftwaffe aircraft flying. The aerial resupply of beleaguered ground forces in the Kholm and Demyansk pockets added to commitments, while the success of aerial resupply set a dangerous precedent for the following fall. In this case, aerial supply worked becaus
