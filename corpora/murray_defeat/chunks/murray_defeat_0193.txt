d ground forces in the Kholm and Demyansk pockets added to commitments, while the success of aerial resupply set a dangerous precedent for the following fall. In this case, aerial supply worked because a variety of factors were different from those involved in the Stalingrad relief operation. First, the front stabilized near the pocket, and forward operating airfields were thus only a short distance from the troops they supplied. Moreover, these forward operating bases were accessible to airfields in the former Baltic countries and were tied directly to the Luftwaffe's infrastructure in Germany. Consequently, it was relatively easy to move aircraft and supplies forward. Unfortunately for the Luftwaffe, it had never possessed the resources to build a sizeable independent transport force; rather a significant percentage of transport aircraft served to transition future bomber pilots from single to multiengine aircraft. 119   ## p. 120 (#148) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT Thus, the only way to build up airlift capability for emergency situations like Demyansk and Stalingrad was to strip training establishments of instructors, pupils, and aircraft; in other words, to shut schools down. But the losses in training resources, particularly in instructor pilots, were not only irreplaceable but were enormous in their cumulative impact. Nevertheless, in the short term, both the Kholm and Demyansk airlifts succeeded in their narrow tactical goals. The pockets held until relieving forces broke through in May. The airlift in support of the Demyansk pocket flew 14,455 missions, moved 24,303 tons of weapons and supplies and 15,445 soldiers into the pocket, and 22,093 wounded out: a performance that averaged between 100 and 150 missions and 265 tons per day.21 But the cost was inordinately high. By the time the army relieved the pocket in May 1942, the Luftwaffe had lost 265 transport aircraft, or 30 percent of its transport force at the end of Fe
