had received rehabilitation in rear areas. The remaining 44 divisions had reinforced and rehabilitated while serving in the frontline. Shortages of vehicles and horses severely limited the mobility of infantry divisions, while the spearhead divisions of panzer and motorized infantry possessed only 80 percent of their authorized motor vehicles. 26 On April 5, 1942, Hitler issued Directive #41 for the summer offensive.
