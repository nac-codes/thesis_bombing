n of the Soviet's ability to resist further German advances. As the OKW War Diary noted on June 25, Hitler believed that Russian resistance would be considerably less than in 1941, and that Army Group South could execute the phases for operation "Blau" with less difficulty and more quickly than originally planned.40 In late July, he demanded that Army Group A "occupy the entire eastern coastline of the Black Sea, force a passage of the Kuban," drive towards Grozny, and thrust through to the Caspian Sea in the Baku area. Simultaneously, Army Group B was to "thrust 123   ## p. 124 (#152) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT forward to Stalingrad, smash the enemy forces concentrated there, . . and... block... land communications between the Don and the Volga [Rivers], as well as the Don itself."41 Thus, not only did Hitler direct the advance along widely diverging axes but the objectives of Army Group A were so diverse that the attempt to gain all insured that German forces would gain none. Hitler also made clear his growing interest in Stalin's city, for one of the Luftwaffe's major tasks was to insure "the early destruction of the city of Stalingrad.' The Luftwaffe's mission in this last great, wide-ranging German offensive of the war represented a replay of the previous year. By and large, its units maintained air superiority over the entire front and severely hampered Soviet reconnaissance and bombing efforts. 42 German aircraft played an important role in breaking up Soviet counterattacks in the first days of "Blau." The Luftwaffe's interdiction of Soviet forces disrupted supplies and, in one case, caught two reserve divisions in the open-150 kilometers east of Stalingrad-and butchered them. Richthofen trumpeted in his diary about a "beautiful bloodbath (Tolles Blutbad!)''43 During this period, most assigned aircraft supported the army's advance. For July and August, Luftwaffe reports to OKW headquarters contained the constant refrain
