As Sixth Army, with its supporting flak and air force units, approached Stalingrad in August, the nearest supply system railhead was 350 kilometers behind in Stalino. With severe shortages of motorized transport, the Wehrmacht faced an increasing logistical problem as the advance continued.49 At the end of July, the drive into the Caucasus ran out of fuel; and while Luftwaffe transport units helped to alleviate 124   ## p. 125 (#153) ############################################  ON THE BRINK some shortages, the bulk nature of fuel made it impossible to alter fundamental supply realities. 50 Consequently, the utilization rate began to fall as units deployed forward to new airfields to support advancing ground forces. Poor communications and the slow arrival of supplies, as well as the primitive conditions found on forward operating bases, added to the Luftwaffe's problems. 51 As German forces surged into the Caucasus, Hitler undercut their efforts. He was now entranced with Stalingrad and on August 1 ordered the transfer of Fourth Panzer Army (two German and Rumanian Corps, the equivalent of eight divisions) from Army Group A to Army Group B. By mid-August, the Germans had cleared out the Don bend and were preparing to cross the Don and to seize Stalingrad. On the 23rd, General von Wietersheim's panzer corps crossed that river in a surprise attack and within one day had advanced to the Volga north of Stalingrad, a distance of 60 kilometers. Aerial support provided by Fliegerkorps VIII, 1,600 sorties, 1,000 tons of bombs, with the loss of only 3 aircraft (and a claim of 91 Russian aircraft shot down) facilitated the rush forward.
