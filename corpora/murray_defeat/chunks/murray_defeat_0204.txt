t. 54 Thus, Hitler's decision to defeat the Soviet Union in 1942 insured that neither the Luftwaffe nor the army would receive a respite to recuperate from the winter defeats of 1942. Perched precariously at the end of long lines of communications and with its strength severely attrited, the Wehrmacht awaited the crushing Russian counterblow. 125   ## p. 126 (#154) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT THE MEDITERRANEAN As in 1941, the Mediterranean had remained a side show for the Germans through most of 1942. Air and ground forces deployed in North Africa represented the minimum required to fend off the British. The fact that Rommel with these forces had won great tactical victories is a tribute to his genius. Nevertheless, his success inevitably led to a rise in the forces deployed against him on the ground as well as in the air. The British, saddled with a series of incompetent commanders on the ground, were well served in the air. From May 1941, Arthur Tedder, one of the outstanding airmen of the war, commanded the RAF in the Middle East, while his deputy, Sir A. "Mary" Coningham, led the air forces assigned to support Eighth Army. Tedder and Coningham built up a force in the 1941-42 period that showed extreme versatility in its employment in close air support, air superiority, and short- and long-range interdiction missions. While the RAF in the Mediterranean gained numerical and qualitative superiority over the Luftwaffe, difficulties complicated the execution of a successful British air strategy. Perhaps the most daunting were the enormous distances that British forces had to traverse within this theater. The distance between Tripoli and El Alamein was 1,500 kilometers, equal to that from East Prussia to Moscow. Moreover, supply lines reached from Britain around the African continent, while the aircraft ferrying system, although involving less distance, crossed Central Africa and thus presented considerable logistical difficulties
