reached from Britain around the African continent, while the aircraft ferrying system, although involving less distance, crossed Central Africa and thus presented considerable logistical difficulties. Moreover, the British suffered from interservice coordination problems. Early in his command, Tedder recognized the interrelationship between the efforts of the three services and that, without a strategic conception, British armed forces could not achieve decisive results. As he noted in his memoirs: The campaign in North Africa provide a prime example of the complementary roles played in the Second World War by all three services. The brunt of the desert battles fell upon the Army and the Royal Air Force; the eventual intention was to turn out of North Africa, bag and baggage, the Italian and German forces. By seeming paradox, this object could not be achieved without success By a further paradox, such superiority at sea could after 1941 be secured only by the exercise of airpower and could certainly not be secured by surface forces alone.55 at sea.... Tedder found it difficult to cooperate with the army which could not understand the particular advantages as well as limitations of the air weapon. 56 On one occasion in 1942, he wrote home that the army's performance resulted from "an excess of bravery and a shortage of brains."'57 The result of such failings in army training, doctrine, and leadership largely nullified British air superiority over the desert battlefield. 58 It was one matter to control the airspace over the battlefield; it was another to translate that superiority into direct success when cooperation with the army broke down or if ground commanders consistently lost to inferior forces. British air and naval forces operating from Malta were a thorn for the Italian logistics to North Africa from the onset of the Mediterranean war.
