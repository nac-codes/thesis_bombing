In September 1941, the British sank 38.5 percent of the tonnage sent from Italy to Libya. In October, the figure reached 63 percent and in November an astonishing level of 77 percent.59 British forces undoubtedly received considerable help from "Ultra" decrypts of Axis cypher traffic, making convoy operations relatively easy to pinpoint and attack. This intolerable pressure on Rommel's logistical system helps explain the sudden transfer of Luftflotte 2 into the theater in November. The fact that these forces represented a substantial portion of the aircraft supporting the advance on Moscow does, however, raise an interesting question about the OKW's strategic priorities. Indeed the arrival of new air units in Sicily in December 1941 allowed the Germans to clear the waters around Malta and protect Axis convoys from British interference. Shipping losses fell to a more acceptable level of 20-30 percent. However, until logistical preparations had been accomplished, Kesselring could not launch an aerial offensive aimed at destroying Malta.60 Beginning in early April 1942, the air offensive on Malta began. By May 10, Second Air Fleet had flown 11,000 sorties against the island fortress and placed the garrison and local population in desperate straits." The question now facing the Germans was whether to proceed with an airborne and naval invasion. After considerable debate within the Axis' high commands, Hitler vetoed the operation. In retrospect, given the enormous logistical difficulties in the theater, Malta's capture would only have made a marginal difference to the North African situation.62 Nevertheless, the failure to seek a decision forced the Luftwaffe to leave strong forces in Sicily to harass Maltaâ€”a further dispersal of limited
