ver well-defended airspaces.67 The second lesson involved problems associated with bad weather and long-range flying by British bombers over hostile territory in night leaflet räids-raids that "Bomber" Harris claimed provided the Germans with their toilet paper needs for much of the war. 68 The German invasion of France and the Low Countries in May 1940 removed most restrictions on bomber activity.69 For the next ten months, Bomber Command launched its aircraft against specific targets in Germany, especially oil plants and transportation systems. The initial hope was that "the accuracy of night bombing [would] differ little from daylight bombing."70 By the spring of 1941, the nature of the problem had emerged. In August of that year, an analysis of mission photographs indicated that only one in three British aircraft was hitting within 75 square miles of its target." In fact, given the lack of navigational aids, Bomber Command had a difficult time in hitting cities. On October 1, 1941, with Karlsruhe and Stuttgart as targets, British bombers "were reported over Aachen, Eupen, Malmedy, Coblenz, Neuwied, Kreuznach, Frankfurt am Main, Wiesbaden, Limburg, Darmstadt, Mainz, Worms, Trier, Offenburg, Saarfels, Nuremberg, Erlangen, Bamberg, Bayreuth, Coburg, Pegnitz, Aschaffenburg, Schweinfurt, Würzburg, Regensburg, Weiden, and Chemnitz."'72 The weight of such evidence pushed Bomber Command and the Air Staff towards "area" bombing, a euphemism for what was to be a "city busting" campaign. But if the considerable difficulties in hitting targets at night pointed in this direction, the doctrinal frame of reference established before the war made "area" bombing an attractive strategy. As early as September 11, 1940, Sir Charles Portal-still Commander of Bomber Command-urged his government to announce the names of 20 German cities targeted for reprisal raids "for each night of indiscriminate bombing by the enemy."'73 In May 1941, Churchill circulated to the Cabinet a paper by Tr
