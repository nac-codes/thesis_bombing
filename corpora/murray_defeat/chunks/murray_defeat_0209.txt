The former Chief of Air Staff (CAS) argued that Germany's population was "particularly susceptible to air bombing." Admitting that only 1 percent of the bombs dropped hit their target, he concluded that: This means that if you are bombing a target at sea, then 99 percent of your bombs are wasted, but not only 99 percent of the bombs are wasted but 99 percent, too, of the pilots and of the training which went to produce them. . . .

The heart of Cherwell's argument lay in his belief that the destruction of housing was the best method to break German resistance. Investigation seems to show that having one's house demolished is most damaging to morale. People seem to mind it more than having their friends or even relatives killed.
