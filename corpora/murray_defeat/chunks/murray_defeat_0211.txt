Harris established excellent relations with the Prime Minister, and over the course of the spring and summer of 1942, he bombarded Churchill with memoranda.78 In these he argued forcefully that only a resolute and sustained bombing offensive could defeat Germany and that diversion of aircraft to protect British shipping, to support the army, or to attack Axis forces in the Mediterranean was a gross misuse of airpower."9 Harris became especially vociferous over the diversion of aircraft to support the war on submarines. The strength of Coastal Command, which is composed largely of suitable bomber types, is today almost the equal of Bomber Command.

The appearance of the first significant navigational aid, Gee, aided the accomplishment of this task. The first demonstration of Gee's effectiveness came in early March 1942, when British bombers devastated the Renault armament factory near Paris.81 The second d
