aided the accomplishment of this task. The first demonstration of Gee's effectiveness came in early March 1942, when British bombers devastated the Renault armament factory near Paris.81 The second demonstration came later in the month with a low level attack on Lubeck, described by Harris as "built more like a firelighter than a human habitation." Post-raid photo reconnaissance indicated that the bombing had destroyed 40 to 50 percent of the city. At the end of April, the command blasted Rostock and a nearby Heinkel factory. 82 But Harris' greatest triumph of the year came in May. By scratching together every aircraft in the command and in its operational training units, he put 1,000 aircraft over Cologne and swamped the night defenses to achieve an unheard of bombing concentration. The raid was a success. With a relatively low loss rate (40 bombers or 3.8 percent of the attacking forces), Bomber Command destroyed much of the city. Later photo reconnaissance indicated that the attack had destroyed 600 acres of Cologne of which 300 lay in the center. The greatest success of the raid may, however, have rested in the political capital it provided Harris. The next 1,000 bomber raid, following soon after Cologne, again underlined the limitations under which the command operated. In early June, Harris sent his bombers against Essen; and with less favorable conditions, the bombers achieved no concentration. In fact, the German high command only reported "widespread raids over West Germany. ''83 While one more 1,000 bomber raid occurred in 1942, Harris, having made nis point, now began the long process of building up his command. The introduction of the "Lancaster" bomber, further aids for blind bombing, and creation of a pathfinder force (the latter with considerable opposition from Harris) resulted in a gradual rise in the command's destructive potential. But as the British advanced, so too did the Germans. By August, the Germans were jamming Gee, and the new pathfinder
