ion from Harris) resulted in a gradual rise in the command's destructive potential. But as the British advanced, so too did the Germans. By August, the Germans were jamming Gee, and the new pathfinder force faced the same navigational and target-finding problems that had for so long plagued the command. Not only that, but there were no target-marking bombs available. 84 If the results from 1942 failed to achieve another striking success, the command at least built up its strength and gathered invaluable experience for 1943. The British did not confine their efforts solely to night bombing. The RAF expended considerable effort throughout 1941 and 1942 in daylight operations, although there was some doubt concerning the bomber's ability to survive without fighter protection. Nevertheless, after the start of "Barbarossa," some senior 130   ## p. 131 (#159) ############################################  ON THE BRINK British officers hoped that the RAF could launch day bombing sorties, protected by fighters, against targets on the continent such as airfields and important factories. In this way, the RAF would force the Germans to fight. Code name for these operations was "Circus." Unfortunately, the results did not meet expectations. The Germans withdrew fighter units from the coast to airfields deep in France and Belgium. There, they could choose whether to fight or not, and British fighter forces, operating at extreme ranges, faced the problem that Bf 109's had confronted in 1940. Moreover, there were relatively few targets of importance to the Nazi war effort; therefore, the Germans fought only when circumstances favored them.85 There was, of course, a solution: either extend the range of existing fighters or design a long-range fighter specifically to protect deep penetration raids. But the RAF showed little interest in drop tanks, and the Air Staff dismissed the notion that British industry could develop a long-range fighter of sufficient capability to take on German
