received damage. In December 1942, a major attack on the Phillips Radio Works in Eindhoven lost 16 percent of the attacking force of 93 bombers, while a further 57 percent were damaged.88 Thus far, we have highlighted the attrition of German air units in World War II. One must emphasize, however, that such losses were endemic to all air forces. From May to September 1942, Bomber Command lost 970 aircraft. In May, the command's average strength had been 417 aircraft. Thus, the loss rate works out to approximately 233 percent in a five-month period. 89 131   ## p. 132 (#160) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT In August 1942, another air force entered the lists against the Luftwaffe. Flying at 23,000 feet, 12 B-17's attacked the marshalling yards at Rouen, while 6 others flew against a diversionary target. Four "Spitfire" squadrons provided protection on the run-in, while five "Spitfire" squadrons covered the withdrawal.‚Åπ0 No losses occurred; and by October 1942, General Ira Eaker informed General Carl "Tooey" Spaatz that this experience indicated that the B-17 could "cope with the German day fighter." In November, Eaker, on the basis of the first 1,100 missions, claimed that German fighters were no match for close formations of American bombers; losses on those first 1,100 missions had totalled only 1.6 percent. Unfortunately, what Eaker left unsaid was the fact that most missions had enjoyed intensive fighter support. Those attacks, however, that had flown to the fringes or beyond of fighter range had suffered a loss rate of 6.4 percent, and no missions had yet reached the Reich." Thus, daylight and unaccompanied bomber attacks on Germany remained very much in question. THE GERMAN RESPONSE: AIR WAR IN THE WEST Germany had entered the war with large fighter and flak forces. However, the air defense system, although not intended to protect the civilian population, was behind the British. This reflected the fact that German strategy was b
