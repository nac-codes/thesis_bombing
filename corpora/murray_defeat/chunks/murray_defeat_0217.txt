the Luftwaffe established the 1st Night Fighter Division in Brussels under General Joseph Kammhuber." The general staff combined various units, including a few flights of Bf 109's, a flight of Do 17's, and one combined flak- searchlight regiment. Initially, defense of the Reich involved a combination of 132   ## p. 133 (#161) ############################################  ON THE BRINK intruder attacks on British bases with a searchlight zone over the Reich for fighter aircraft to attack illuminated bombers. The first tactic showed promise, but Hitler halted intruder operations in the summer of 1941 in view of mounting bomber losses against Russia. Thereafter, he rarely allowed German night fighters or bombers to attack RAF bombers in their lair. Thus, from 1941, Germany's air defense emphasized passive operations with few offensive thrusts. To help defend the fatherland, Kammhuber's defensive measures involved the extensive use of searchlight belts in western Germany working in tandem with Bf 109's. At the beginning, these efforts depended on accoustical devices to locate approaching bombers. Not surprisingly, the fighters achieved few successes since Luftwaffe fighters could hardly locate the bombers, a situation quite analogous to the RAF's inability to find German cities. Beginning in October 1940, the Germans introduced WÃ¼rzburg radar units into the struggle with the first set in Holland. By late 1941, Kammhuber had established a belt of radar stations reaching from Denmark to Holland and then south through Belgium and northern France. The system provided early warning as well as ground control intercept (GCI) stations to support a growing force of night fighters with their own radar sets. Kammhuber established a tight system in which each GCI station controlled one fighter operating in a designated area that was a portion of the larger belt. Helped substantially by the experimentation of Major W. Falk, Kammhuber's air defense forces represented a formidable thr
