fighter operating in a designated area that was a portion of the larger belt. Helped substantially by the experimentation of Major W. Falk, Kammhuber's air defense forces represented a formidable threat to Bomber Command's operations by the start of 1942. What had been a thin line in front of the Ruhr in early 1941 had become a defensive system of considerable depth and extent by the following year. The system did have one obvious weakness. With only one German GCI station and fighter over a given area, Bomber Command was in a position to swamp the defenses if it could feed its aircraft through the German defensive system in a concentrated stream. 96 Unfortunately for Germany's cities, these efforts raised only occasional interest in the high command or in the Luftwaffe's general staff. Throughout 1941 and 1942, most eyes remained centered on Russia. There were admittedly some nasty shocks in the spring of 1942. Heavy air raids on Lubeck and Rostock disturbed some in the high command, and Goebbels found time to rage in his diary about the destruction of art by British barbarians." Lubeck, however, was hardly of decisive importance for Germany; and while the OKW noted the attacks on Rostock, it gave the raids no particular significance. 98 The attack on Cologne was another matter. The Luftwaffe's underestimation of the attacking force and a miscalculation of Hitler's mood exacerbated the impression created by the destruction.99 Calculating that air defense forces had accounted for 37 British bombers (in fact the British lost 40100), the Luftwaffe urged that in view of what it termed a 50-percent success, the Reich's propaganda services issue a victory bulletin. Not only did Hitler refuse the request in sharp terms but he pointedly remarked that the bomber force contained a higher number of aircraft than estimated. Disregarding enemy propaganda claims, Hitler argued, the damage on the ground indicated that something extraordinary had occurred. 133   ## p. 134 (#162)
