d a higher number of aircraft than estimated. Disregarding enemy propaganda claims, Hitler argued, the damage on the ground indicated that something extraordinary had occurred. 133   ## p. 134 (#162) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT On June 3, Hitler received Jeschonnek and gave the Chief of Staff a severe dressing down. He ridiculed Luftwaffe estimates on the bomber force attacking Cologne and its efforts to "gloss over or to describe what was a catastrophe as a defensive victory." In the conversation, Hitler made two further comments fraught with significance for Germany's future. First, he suggested that the only reply to such "terror" raids was retaliation in kind. Also, Hitler pointed out quite correctly that these raids signaled an attempt to establish an aerial second front. He concluded his discussions with Jeschonnek by remarking that: "I never hide from the truth, but I must see clearly in order to be able to draw correct conclusions."'101 Fortunately for Bomber Command, despite efforts to launch further 1,000 plane raids, it did not again in 1942 achieve the success of the Cologne attack. Thus, Hitler did not draw the correct conclusions. As the OKW War Diary reported British failures in descriptions of widely dispersed efforts, the threat slipped from German consciousness. 102 Consequently, Kammhuber's night defense forces received only minimal reinforcements. From 116 aircraft assigned to night air defense in September 1940, the force grew to 250 aircraft in September 1941 and to 345 aircraft in September 1942.103 However, had further Colognes occurred in 1942, Kammhuber might have received the resources in late 1942 and early 1943 that the night defenses received in response to the Hamburg catastrophe of July 1943, which ultimately enabled them to decimate Bomber Command in early 1944. In reaction to the spring raids of 1942, the Germans launched a series of night retaliatory raids against British cities. Shortly after
