timately enabled them to decimate Bomber Command in early 1944. In reaction to the spring raids of 1942, the Germans launched a series of night retaliatory raids against British cities. Shortly after the Rostock raid, a member of the German foreign office announced that the Luftwaffe, using the Baedecker tourist guide, would strike the name of each British city destroyed off the list. 104 The British in response termed these summer 1942 night raids, "Baedecker” raids. In reality, the raids achieved little significant damage; bomber losses were high, particularly in training units which lost heavily among instructional crews. 105 Not only had further attrition taken place in the hard-pressed bomber forces but once again the Germans had sacrificed long-range interests, the training of future combat aircrews, for short-term expedience. 106 In March 1941, Göring held a major conference for units in the west. After describing in detail the coming air offensive against Britain, he secretly admitted to Adolf Galland and Werner Mölders that "there's not a word of truth in it." Forces would transfer from France to the Russian theater leaving only a few fighters in the west. Although only approximately two fighter wings remained in the west for the next year and a half, many of the best fighter crews remained in that theater. Similarly, the best equipment went to the west; industry supplied the Fw 190's to the western theater first, and only the latest model Bf 109's fought over France and Belgium. 107 Small in numbers (no more than 180 aircraft), the western fighter forces were among the best in the Luftwaffe. The daylight aerial defense of the west soon pulled back to bases deep in France and Belgium from which German fighters met the "Circus" operations on more or less equal terms. At the farthest extension of "Spitfire" range, the Germans could choose whether to fight or not. Although numerically superior in operations over 134   ## p. 135 (#163) #########################
