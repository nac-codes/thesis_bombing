erms. At the farthest extension of "Spitfire" range, the Germans could choose whether to fight or not. Although numerically superior in operations over 134   ## p. 135 (#163) ############################################  ON THE BRINK western Europe, the British at no time dominated the Luftwaffe. When they wished to do so, the Germans could challenge the RAF in most effective fashion. Two examples-the breakout of the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, and the Dieppe raid of August 1942-underline the conditions of the 1942 western air battle. In the first case, the two battle cruisers had lain in French ports for nearly a year under attack from British bombers. Worried by the possible loss of one or both of these ships to air attack and afraid that the Allies might invade Scandinavia, Hitler ordered the ships to break through the Channel to Germany from whence they could eventually move to northern waters. In charge of the air cover, Galland drew on two fighter wings in France as well as one from Germany; he began the operation with approximately 250 fighters. In a well-coordinated effort, the Germans brought the ships home. Despite the fact that mines damaged both battle cruisers, German fighter aircraft kept the RAF from intervening in a decisive fashion. 108 The Dieppe tragedy does not need a full recapitulation here, but the air action that day is worthy of note. In August 1942, Allied forces raided the port of Dieppe; the purpose of the attack was to seize the port and test planning theories for an eventual invasion of the continent. The raid itself was a dismal tactical failure. Canadian troops never got past the sea wall; most were butchered on the beaches. As naval units struggled to get the survivors off, the Luftwaffe intervened in rising numbers and a major air battle took place. By the end of the operation, the Luftwaffe had written off 21 fighters (4 Bf 109's and 17 Fw 190's) and 27 bombers (7 Ju 88's, 1 He 111, and 19 Do 217's). 109 The British, however, in add
