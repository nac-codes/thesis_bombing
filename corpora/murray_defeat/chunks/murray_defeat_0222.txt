took place. By the end of the operation, the Luftwaffe had written off 21 fighters (4 Bf 109's and 17 Fw 190's) and 27 bombers (7 Ju 88's, 1 He 111, and 19 Do 217's). 109 The British, however, in addition to considerable ground losses, lost 1 destroyer to air attack and 106 aircraft. 110 While the direct impact of Dieppe was of little importance, the raid's strategic lessons had a critical effect on the war's future. The Germans drew the wrong conclusions and believed that Dieppe indicated that at its start the coming Allied invasion would attempt to seize a major port. Such a conclusion greatly aided deception plans surrounding "Overlord." On the Allied side, British and American commanders concluded that seizure of a builtup area, such as a port city, represented too hazardous an operation. Thus, they determined to take the port with them (the "Mulberry" harbors). The second vital lesson drawn was that local air superiority over western France and the Low Countries was insufficient for the success of such a complex operation. Rather, the Allies needed complete air superiority over western Europe, a circumstance that only the defeat of the Luftwaffe could achieve. There is one parenthetical aspect of the air war that touches tangentially on this study and that is the role of aircraft in the war on trade. Fortunately for Britain, the war at sea raised minimal interest in Göring. Thus, despite a great opportunity, the Reichsmarschall's willingness to cooperate with the navy was almost nonexistent. 112 The general staff did select two bomber wings in the summer of 1939 to operate against British trade, while the seizure of Narvik in April 1940 revealed the long-range potential of the Fw 200, the "Condor." Nevertheless, despite the time required to train bomber crews in navigation over water, Göring used these specialized crews in the bombing offensive against Britain in the summer and fall of 1940. By March 1941, Fliegerführer Atlantik (air commander, Atlantic) 135
