avigation over water, Göring used these specialized crews in the bombing offensive against Britain in the summer and fall of 1940. By March 1941, Fliegerführer Atlantik (air commander, Atlantic) 135   ## p. 136 (#164) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT possessed a total of 83 aircraft (21 “Condors," 26 He 111's, 24 He 115 torpedo bombers, and 12 Ju 88/Me 110 reconnaissance aircraft). By July, the number had increased to 155 aircraft, a force hardly capable of inflicting decisive damage on British convoys. Despite the scarcity of aircraft, long-range "Condors" had a serious impact on the naval war. In January, German aircraft sank 20 ships for a total of 78,517 tons, while U-boats sent to the bottom 21 vessels (126,782 tons). The following month, "Condors" sank 27 ships (89,305 tons); thereafter, British countermeasures restricted the threat. 113 Nevertheless, these successes by a small number of aircraft indicate what the Germans might have achieved with more resources. In 1942, the efforts of the Luftwaffe's antishipping forces centered on northern waters. Failure in the east led the Germans to make a major effort to shut off western aid reaching Russia through Murmansk. In 1941, the Germans had constructed a series of airfields in northern Norway to support ground forces operating in the Arctic. These fields proved useful when the Luftwaffe turned to attacking North Cape convoys. The first aerial attacks, launched against convoy PQ 16, managed to sink 7 out of 34 ships. The next operation, against PQ 17, was more successful and resulted in destruction of 23 out of 34 ships. For the Luftwaffe, this attack represented its last major success against Allied shipping. The next Murmansk convoy in the fall possessed aircraft carrier protection, and British fighters extracted heavy losses from attacking aircraft. Soon thereafter, however, the Luftwaffe shut down operations in Arctic waters because the invasion of North Africa resulted in the
