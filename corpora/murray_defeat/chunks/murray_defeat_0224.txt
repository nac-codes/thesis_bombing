and British fighters extracted heavy losses from attacking aircraft. Soon thereafter, however, the Luftwaffe shut down operations in Arctic waters because the invasion of North Africa resulted in the transfer of antishipping units from the North Cape to the Mediterranean. 114 In the final analysis, German efforts to attack British shipping by air achieved disproportionate successes for the level of effort expended. Nevertheless, while suggesting what the Luftwaffe might have accomplished with more resources, the war against Allied commerce never aroused Göring's interest, and the opportunity vanished. GERMAN PRODUCTION, 1942: PERFORMANCE AND IMPLICATIONS Milch's 1942 production program, the so-called "Göring program," had largely been predicated on the winning of the Russian campaign. 115 The army's failure in front of Moscow raised serious difficulties for the possibility of increasing aircraft production. Heavy equipment losses in Russia, combined with ongoing military operations in the east, gave Hitler no choice but to switch industrial priorities back to army production. 116 Three weeks after Hitler's decision, Milch noted to Jeschonnek what the impact would be: (a) Instead of a transfer of workers from the army to Luftwaffe tasks, a heavy withdrawal of air force workers [in favor of the army]. (b) Industrial capacity already surrendered by the army to the air force to be returned. 136   ## p. 137 (#165) ############################################  ON THE BRINK (c) Unexpectedly strong limitations on raw material allocations-for example, only one-half of expected copper. (d) Extraordinary reductions in construction projects in support of weapons and industry. (e) Similar difficulties and no adjustments with the machine tool industry. 117 Thomas estimated that production priorities would mean that the aircraft industry could complete only 60 percent of the "Göring program.' 118 In fact, no such reduction occurred. Despite the fact that the aircraft industry pos
