uction priorities would mean that the aircraft industry could complete only 60 percent of the "Göring program.' 118 In fact, no such reduction occurred. Despite the fact that the aircraft industry possessed the same work force and aluminum allocation that it had had in 1941, aircraft production began a dramatic acceleration that would continue into 1943 and 1944. From an average monthly production of 981 aircraft in 1941 (311 fighters and 363 bombers), German production rose to 1,296 per month in 1942, a 32 percent increase (434 fighters, 39.5 percent; and 545 bombers, 50 percent). In December 1942, production reached 1,548 aircraft, a 58 percent increase over December 1941, including 554 fighters (110 percent) and 674 bombers (69 percent).119 As suggested earlier, this dramatic increase was largely due to one man, Erhard Milch. To begin with, Milch established a close working relationship with the new armaments czar, Albert Speer, who had succeeded Dr. Fritz Todt after the latter's death in an aircraft crash. In addition to Todt's powers, Speer received far wider latitude than Todt had ever possessed. Only the Luftwaffe remained independent of Speer's direct control, although cooperation between Speer and Milch removed much of the friction characterizing previous relationships. 120 Nevertheless, the army's desperate condition in the east and high ammunition expenditures in the great land battles on the eastern front forced Milch to make-do with what the Luftwaffe had received in previous years. While the Germans possessed significant resources of aluminum, aircraft production faced serious competition from other users. In 1941, 5,116 tons of aluminum per month (16 percent of all allocations) went to ammunition production for the three services (for fuses, incendiaries, tracers, etc.). Milch noted to Göring that this equalled the aluminum necessary to produce 1,000 Do 217's or 4,000 Bf 109's. 121 Altogether, aircraft construction received 74 percent of aluminum prod
