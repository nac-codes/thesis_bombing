tracers, etc.). Milch noted to Göring that this equalled the aluminum necessary to produce 1,000 Do 217's or 4,000 Bf 109's. 121 Altogether, aircraft construction received 74 percent of aluminum production. 122 From the last quarter of 1941, allocations to aircraft production began to run seriously in arrears and that situation remained constant throughout 1942.123 While Milch waged a running battle to increase aluminum allocations for the aircraft industry, he undertook substantive measures to improve manufacturing efficiency. First, he cracked down on wasteful practices that had characterized German industry; aluminum allocations to manufacturers now depended on actual use in the production of each aircraft rather than an absurdly high industry-wide average set by the Air Ministry. By 1943, recycling of scrap aluminum as well as crashed aircraft had increased available aluminum by 57 percent. Also, important was the fact that substitute materials, such as steel alloys and wood, stretched aluminum allocations. 124 Success was dramatic. In 1942, with 15,000 fewer tons of 137   ## p. 138 (#166) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT aluminum, German industry produced 3,780 more aircraft weighing a total of 28,628 more tons. 125 On the labor side of aircraft production, Milch and industry leaders achieved similar results. Through 1941, the aircraft industry had received a disproportionate share of labor resources, undoubtedly because of Göring's position as leader of the Four Year Plan. In late 1941, however, Hitler ended the Luftwaffe's favored position; and over the course of 1942 despite a massive influx of foreign laborers into Germany, the aircraft industry received few new workers. 126 Beginning in the summer of 1941, Milch had demanded that the aircraft industry rationalize production methods and use raw material allocations as well as its work force better. The result of such pressure was a steady increase in productivity from 1941
