hat the aircraft industry rationalize production methods and use raw material allocations as well as its work force better. The result of such pressure was a steady increase in productivity from 1941 through 1943 (although not nearly as marked as in the United States) as German industry introduced mass production methods. 127 But no matter how revolutionary the new methods were in terms of German industrial practices, aircraft manufacturers never came close to equalling what occurred in the United States where, as one historian of the strategic bombing offensive has noted, American industry was turning out aircraft like "cans of beans. "'128 Despite Milch's drive to increase production, there remained considerable skepticism in the general staff as to the size of the proposed program. As late as March 1942, Jeschonnek objected to Milch's urgings for a rapid increase in fighter production. He remarked, "I do not know what I should do with more than 360 fighters!''129 By June, the Chief of Staff had modified his opinion and written Milch that the general staff foresaw a need for a monthly production of at least 900 fighters by the winter of 1943-44.130 Nevertheless, in view of the attrition rates of 1940 and 1941, Jeschonnek's March comment can only be described as remarkable. The impact of Milch's success was favorable for the short run. Given the difficulties that the Luftwaffe had experienced at the end of 1941, this was not surprising. With heavy commitments in Russia, indicators such as unit strength as a percentage of authorized strength underwent gradual improvement over the spring and summer of 1942.131 Encouraging also for frontline commanders was the fact that operational ready rates also began a slow climb from the depths of winter 1941-42. From a low of 39 percent for all combat aircraft (44 percent for fighters and 31 percent for bombers) in late January 1942, the in-commission rate had risen to 69 percent for combat aircraft by late June (75 percent for
