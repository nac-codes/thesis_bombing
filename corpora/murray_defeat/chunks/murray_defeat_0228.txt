cent for all combat aircraft (44 percent for fighters and 31 percent for bombers) in late January 1942, the in-commission rate had risen to 69 percent for combat aircraft by late June (75 percent for fighters and 66 percent for bombers). Thereafter, however, heavy operations in the east and commitments over great distances resulted in a fall in overall operational ready rates to as low as 59 percent and no higher than 65 percent for the remainder of the year. 132 If the Luftwaffe had recovered some strength, the patient was still in serious condition. The most discouraging of the 1942 indicators confronting the Luftwaffe was the fact that increased aircraft losses accompanied rising production. In fact, by June 1942 the Luftwaffe possessed only 60 more combat aircraft than one year earlier (June 21, 1941: 4,882 aircraft; June 20, 1942: 4,942 aircraft). For the remainder of 1942 as commitments multiplied, aircraft strength fell until by the end of the year the Germans had less than 4,400 combat aircraft. 133 Thus, not only were the 138   ## p. 139 (#167) ############################################  ON THE BRINK Germans losing more aircraft in numerical terms but attrition in absolute terms now took place at a faster rate than in 1941. The attrition taking place through October 1942 (see Table XXIX134) underscores the demands on the Luftwaffe as the Wehrmacht made its last lunge forward. By the end of October, in terms of its operational ready rate, its force structure, and its attrition thus far in the year, the Luftwaffe was dangerously overextended. CONCLUSION The Luftwaffe's problems in 1942 directly reflected the catastrophic failure of German grand strategy in Russia. In a larger sense, however, the root of those problems lay in the unjustified overconfidence that had marked German strategic and industrial planning after the stunning victory over France. Because the Germans had done so little to expand production despite control over most of Europe, the Reich's
