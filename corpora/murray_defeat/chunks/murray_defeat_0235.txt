These tabulations are based on the author's calculation of losses reported to the Luftwaffe quartermaster general in BA/MA, RL 2 III/1181, 1182, 1183. These reports indicate the day on which aircraft were lost, although the monthly loss reports the quartermaster general submitted to the general staff reflected the day on which the loss report arrived in Berlin. There was generally a four-day to one- month slippage between the actual loss and its report to Berlin. Thus, the author's retabulation for the 1942-43 period represents the most accurate picture that one can get of actual losses when they occurred. One must add that, as in all administrative organizations, not every loss was reported, although the incentive to do so was strong since it was on the basis of these loss reports that the supply service issued replacement aircraft. Unfortunately, direct loss tables for 1944 seem to have been lost; consequently, some figures for 1944 are more difficult to specifically tabulate. Nevertheless, drawing on the information contained in other tables, one can establish a clear trend to Luftwaffe losses. We shall, of course, do so in succeeding chapters. 46.
