As a percentage of total air strength (all theaters), these losses represented 18.3 percent of fighters, 17 percent of bombers, and 31.8 percent of dive bombers on hand at the beginning of April. 52 What seems to have happened is that, despite a lower scale of combat and a chance to relieve the pressure on the flying units, the Germans found the urge to use their air assets in insignificant operations irresistible. The spring thaw raised the question of strategy for the coming summer. Manstein later claimed that he urged a defensive/offensive strategy: The Wehrmacht would adapt a defensive posture and allow the Russians the first move. Then using the armored reserves that were rebuilt by rising tank production, the Germans would slam the door shut.53 Such a strategy was too risky for Hitler and certainly did not appeal to his aggressive instincts. If the Germans were to attack, however, the question was where, when, and with what. On January 23, 1943, armored strength on the eastern front totalled only 495 useable tanks.54 Considerable resupply took place over the next months, but operations in late winter caused heavy losses.
