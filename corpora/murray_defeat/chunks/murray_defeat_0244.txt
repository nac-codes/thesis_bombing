In addition, the Russians had dug two or three lines of trenches in the main zone of resistance, and to the rear were second and third zones constructed in the same fashion. 60 157   ## p. 158 (#178) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT By July, there was no hope of surprise.
