rebuilding units scheduled for the offensive. But the effect of high attrition and the drop in training hours for new pilots had an obvious impact on combat effectiveness. A rueful Jeschonnek admitted to GÃ¶ring that despite high deliveries of aircraft to fighter units, losses due to noncombat causes were severely affecting capabilities. A substantial portion of the Luftwaffe strength still remained on the Russian front. Of the total aircraft available at the end of June, 38.7 percent were in the east; more specifically, 84.5 percent of all dive bombers, 27 percent of all fighters, and 33 percent of all bombers were serving in the east.65 For the offensive, the Luftwaffe concentrated nearly all this strength in the two Luftflotten deployed near Kursk. In the north, Luftflotte 6 possessed 750 aircraft, while Luftflotte 4 controlled 1,100 aircraft to support the southern drive.66 The air fleets opened the offensive with a massive strike. On the first day, German aircraft flew 3,000 sorties, and some "Stuka" pilots flew up to six missions. Nevertheless, unlike previous years, the Luftwaffe did not gain air superiority.67 If German pilots inflicted heavy losses on Soviet fighters and bombers, their opponents simply put up more aircraft, while German losses inexorably mounted. Soviet "Sturmoviks" struck German ground forces, while Russian bombers hit transportation points. Moreover, the subsequent German failure at Kursk and the Russian summer offensive then forced the Luftwaffe to divide its assets to meet the desperate situation on the ground. The retreat from Orel, the Kharkov battle, and a massive Soviet offensive along the lower Donets made extensive demands on Luftwaffe resources in three widely separated areas. As a result, the large striking force assembled for "Citadel" now became three small forces engaged in bolstering the situation on the ground. For the remainder of the war, as Russian offensives ripped German defenses to shreds, this was to be the fate of t
