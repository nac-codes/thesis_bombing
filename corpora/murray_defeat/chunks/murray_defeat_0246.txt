del" now became three small forces engaged in bolstering the situation on the ground. For the remainder of the war, as Russian offensives ripped German defenses to shreds, this was to be the fate of the Luftwaffe. With decreasingly skilled pilots but increasing commitments, the eastern Luftflotten became the backwater of German efforts in the air. 158   ## p. 159 (#179) ############################################  ATTRITION ON THE PERIPHERY The losses that Luftflotten 4 and 6 suffered in July and August underline the Luftwaffe's overcommitment. In this two-month period, the Germans lost 1,030 aircraft in the east, 16 percent of their total force structure as of June 30, 1943 (351 fighters, 19 percent of all fighters; 273 bombers, 16.4 percent of all bombers; and 202 dive bombers, 38.6 percent of available dive bombers). But the losses should not be viewed in isolation since the air battle in Russia was only one of the three massive commitments that the Luftwaffe faced in the summer. While we shall discuss the implications of fighting on three major fronts simultaneously at the end of this chapter, one must note that total losses for all theaters in July and August were 3,213 aircraft (50.6 percent) and 1,313 fighters (71 percent).68 This was a loss rate that no air force could sustain. Consequently, the Luftwaffe had to cut its losses and commitments; to meet the threat at home, it surrendered air superiority on the periphery to Allied air forces. THE MEDITERRANEAN In the summer of 1942, Churchill and Roosevelt settled on a Mediterranean strategy. American planners, however, gave heavy emphasis to landings in Morocco, while the British pushed for a landing as far east along the coast of Africa as possible to prevent a German move in Tunisia.69 The compromise between these views insured that the Allies would gain control of Algeria but could not prevent the Germans from seizing Tunisia. The OKW did not have a clear picture of Allied intentions as the invasion convoy
