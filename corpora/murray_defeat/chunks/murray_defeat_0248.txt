The result, as we shall see, was a thoroughly needless attrition of German air strength. The ground forces and materiel eventually lost were, arguably, replaceable. Losses in aircraft and pilots were not. The deteriorating position at El Alamein led to a significant augmentation in Luftflotte 2's air strength. In the three months of July, August, and September 1942, Rommel had received 40,000 troops and 4,000 tons of supplies by air. The exhaustion of crews and aircraft, the collapse of sea supply lines to Libya as "Ultra" information allowed the Allies to devastate convoys, and the combination of the Africa Corps' defeat and "Torch" forced the Luftwaffe to send 150 Ju 52's to the Mediterranean in early November; and an additional 170 followed at the end of the month. This movement of transport aircraft, combined with the Stalingrad airlift, effectively shut down instrument and bomber transition schools. 74 The development into the Mediterranean also explains why the Luftwaffe found it difficult to transfer more transport aircraft to Luftflotte 4 and the Stalingrad supply effort. In November and December, transport squadrons flew in 41,768 troops, 8,614.8 tons of equipment and supplies, and 1,472.8 tons of fuel. The cost, however, was prohibitive. The Luftwaffe lost no less than 128 Ju 52's in November and December, with an additional 36 destroyed in January (13.9 percent of the Luftwaffe's total transport strength). When combined with those lost at Stalingrad, the Germans had managed to lose 659 transport aircraft (56 percent of the transport force as of November 10) by the end of January.75 The German response to "Torch" led to a major transfer of bombers and fighters into the theater. As early as November 4, Luftflotte 4 gave up a fighter group to the Mediterranean.76 Moreover, the North African invasion forced the Germans to shut down att
