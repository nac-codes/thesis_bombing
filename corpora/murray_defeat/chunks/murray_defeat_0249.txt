of bombers and fighters into the theater. As early as November 4, Luftflotte 4 gave up a fighter group to the Mediterranean.76 Moreover, the North African invasion forced the Germans to shut down attacks on the Murmansk convoys and to send additional antishipping units into the Mediterranean." German bomber and fighter forces operating from Tunisia, Sicily, and Sardinia inflicted considerable damage on Allied shipping and ground forces. The Allies faced two problems in bringing airpower to bear on the bridgehead. The first was one of logistics. Tedder's air forces, still located on Egyptian bases, were too far away to intervene effectively, while the bases that Eighth Army captured in its march along the North African littoral took time to repair and stockpile. Similarly, the air forces in Algeria and Morocco found it difficult to marshal the logistical effort needed in eastern Algeria where it counted. The second problem involved command and control. Anglo-American units in French Northwest Africa operated under different procedures, while Tedder's forces in Middle East Command operated differently. The solution to the first problem was a matter of time. By early January 1943, Allied air forces from Algeria were intervening with greater effectiveness, and Tedder's forces soon joined up. The second problem was also easily solved. As early as December 19, the Mediterranean naval commander, Sir Andrew Cunningham, cabled London that, "There is one solution and that is to put Tedder in here." Eisenhower brought "Tooey" Spaatz out from England as his deputy, but at Casablanca the Combined Chiefs appointed Tedder as Commander of Allied Mediterranean Air Forces.78 160   ## p. 161 (#181) ############################################  ATTRITION ON THE PERIPHERY  GIBRALTAR ORAN CASABLANCA MOROCCO THE MEDITERRANEAN ROME TARANTO NAPLES ALGIERS PANTELLERIA BIZERTA SICILY TUNIS • MALTA ¡TUNISIA CRETES ALGERIA TRIPOLI BENGHAZI GAZALA ALEXANDRIA TOBRUKI CAIRO EL ALAMEIN EL AGHEILA
