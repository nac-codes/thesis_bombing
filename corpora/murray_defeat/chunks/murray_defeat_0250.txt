He argued that the presence of such fighters would significantly reduce bomber casualties, while their use "as intruders would greatly increase the effectiveness of our strategic operations."'80 The result of such leadership was soon felt. Tedder and Spaatz used their air resources in a coherent campaign to gain air superiority in the Mediterranean. Their strategy aimed at supporting the overall theater objective of destroying Axis forces in Tunisia rather than a more cavalier "independent" air strategy. As was the case throughout the war, air strategy proved most effective when integrated into an overall strategy in which air, land, and naval forces worked closely together.
