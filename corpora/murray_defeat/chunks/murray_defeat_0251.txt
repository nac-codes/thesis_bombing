Allied air units played an important role in disrupting the Kasserine attack, while the shock of the German offensive resulted in considerable improvements in cooperation between American ground and air forces.81 Meanwhile, Allied antishipping strikes, attacks on harbors, and mine laying operations added to the difficulty of bringing convoys over from Sicily. By February, Allied air operations so impeded the supply situation for Axis forces that most German fighters were limited to protecting ports and convoy routes; this growing failure of sea transport forced the Germans to depend increasingly on aerial resupply. 82 Allied air and naval forces were creating a situation analogous to Stalingrad, except that in the case of Tunisia, the agony lasted longer and imposed a higher attrition on Luftwaffe assets. 83 In March, the German's desperate situation in North Africa became hopeless. The growing quantitative superiority of Allied fighters reduced the survivability of "Stukas," while the deteriorating ground situation resulted in more calls for air support. As a result, German bombers ceased attacks on Allied ports so as to support the hard-pressed troops at the front. This change in bomber strategy not only eased Allied supply troubles but also probably increased German bomber losses as well as being of doubtful utility for the ground situation.84 Moreover, Allied air and naval attacks on convoys from Sicily halted naval movement by the end of March. Making the supply of Tunisia, in the face of overwhelming Allied air and naval superiority, almost impossible was the fact the "Ultra" provided Anglo- American commanders with accurate and timely information on military convoys from Sicily. So well prepared were Allied air forces that Fliegerkorps Tunis concluded in mid-March "that the course for convoys D and C were betrayed to the 162   ## p. 163 (#183) ########################################
