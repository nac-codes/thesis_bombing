There was, then, no other choice for the Germans but to fall back on airlift. This aerial supply of Tunisia in the spring represented the third disaster for the Luftwaffe's transport fleet within a six-month period. In April and the first week of May, as the Tunisian pocket burned itself out, the Luftwaffe lost 177 more Ju 52's, along with a number of specialized aircraft such as the Me 323, the "Giant."'86 Particularly noteworthy was the loss of 6 "Giants" and 25 Ju 52's flying to Tunisia ferrying 800 German troops. 87 The third slaughter of German transport aircraft within a six-month period had a wider impact than just on the transport force. As one ranking officer told another after capture: "You cannot imagine how catastrophic the air personnel [situation] is.

Table XXXII89 gives the Mediterranean losses in terms of major aircraft types during the period and suggests their significance for the Luftwaffe.
