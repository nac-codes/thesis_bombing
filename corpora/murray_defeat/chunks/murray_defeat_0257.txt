Nevertheless, Germany's Mediterranean command deserves its share of responsibility. Kesselring's optimistic reporting throughout the period misled both the OKW and Hitler. 104 By the summer of 1943, even the Führer seems to have had doubts. He refused to believe "smiling Albert's" assurrance that Mussolini's overthrow did not indicate a shift in Italy's attitude towards the war.

Nevertheless, those successes provided Harris with the time and political clout to turn his command into an effective weapon, although the 1942 campaign bought that time at considerable cost.
