command into an effective weapon, although the 1942 campaign bought that time at considerable cost. The command's strength seems to have varied between 400 and 500 aircraft in 1942;106 losses for the year were 1,404 aircraft shot down and 2,724 damaged. Air raids during 1942 directed against Essen in which British bombers caused no significant damage cost Bomber Command no less than 201 bombers. 107 Of the new four-engine bombers now reaching frontline squadrons, the British wrote off 228 "Stirlings," 249 "Halifaxes," and 202 "Lancasters.'' 108 Despite these depressing statistics, Bomber Command entered 1943 on an upswing. Squadrons were receiving four-engine bombers in quantity, and introduction of Oboe, a directional aid, H2S, a radar target locator, and target marking techniques in the pathfinder force gave British bombers the capability to place bombs in the area of the target under certain conditions. As Harris later noted, the command was "at long last . . . ready and equipped.' ready and equipped."109 But he had little intention of integrating its operations with others except on his own terms, an attitude he had displayed since the war's beginning. 110 Harris, by now a firm advocate of "area" bombing, would wage his campaign in 1943 with ruthless determination. Beginning in March 1943 and for the following three months, Harris' forces battered the Ruhr. As the official historians note, this attack "marked the beginning of a famous Battle in the course of which Bomber Command was to show itself capable of achieving not only an occasional victory, as had previously been the case, but a whole series of consistent and pulverizing blows among which the failures were much rarer than the successes. 111 Nevertheless, while British bombers inflicted serious damage on German cities, mission failures pointed up the limitations on operations. Two separate attacks against the Skoda works (beyond the range of navigational aids) achieved nothing. The first mistook a lunat
