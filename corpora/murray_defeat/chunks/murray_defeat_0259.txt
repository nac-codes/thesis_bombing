rman cities, mission failures pointed up the limitations on operations. Two separate attacks against the Skoda works (beyond the range of navigational aids) achieved nothing. The first mistook a lunatic asylum for the works, while the second attack in May achieved an excellent bombing concentration in open fields 2 miles to the north. 112 While the May 1943 raids on the dams in the Ruhr Valley paved the way for subsequent successful operational developments in 1944, Bomber Command 166   ## p. 167 (#187) ############################################  ATTRITION ON THE PERIPHERY overall in 1943 could only act as a bludgeon. It possessed the ability to hit large cities with devastating blows; but with the exception of Essen and a few other cities, German industry lay on the outskirts of major towns. In fact, it is probably an accurate estimate of the command's capabilities to say that it did more collateral damage to industrial targets in the 1943 "area" bombing than would have been the case had it waged a campaign directly aimed at destroying German industry. The dams raids point out a major factor in the failure of bombing to achieve decisive results. Luck eliminated most of the aircraft ordered to take out the critical Sorpe Dam; as a result, only the Möhne and less important Eder Dams received damage. To their surprise, the Germans were able to repair the Möhne Dam by the fall of 1943 with no interference against the vulnerable reconstruction work.' Allied air commanders still tended to overestimate raid damage and underestimate German recuperative powers. 113 Bomber Command pounded Germany in the spring of 1943 at a terrible cost to itself. Losses in the "Battle of the Ruhr" reached the point where Harris' forces flirted with defeat. In 43 major attacks, the RAF lost 872 bombers with 2,126 damaged. Despite these losses, frontline strength rose from 593 crews and aircraft in February to 787 in August-a reflection of the massive production and crew training programs.
