on a wholly different scale from anything in previous experience. Much of the fire-fighting force was on the city's western side to fight smoldering coke and coal fires; this factor, combined with the occurrence of warm, dry weather and the disruption of the water system by the previous bombing, created the right conditions for the start of a massive fire storm.

Further bombing spread the fire storm to the northeast as the phonomena of "creep back" occurred (late bombers dumping their loads short of the first bombings). By the next morning, fire had burned an enormous 4- square-mile hole in the city with considerable peripheral damage to areas adjacent to the great fire.118 Between 30 and 40,000 people perished. 119 Yet, the ordeal was not over. On the evening of July 29, a third great raid occurred. Bomber Command again heavily bombed the city; material damage came close to that of the July 27 raid. Loss of life, however, was considerably less; no fire storm occurred, and the Gauleiter the Nazi Party's official on the scene had begun a substantial evacuation of the population. 120 One final raid followed early in August, but bad weather spared Hamburg further devastation. Bomber Command achieved this terrible success at little cost. The missing rates in the four raids on Hamburg were 1.5 percent, 2.2 percent, 3.5 percent, and 4 percent. The rise in losses did reflect a surprisingly quick re
