d this terrible success at little cost. The missing rates in the four raids on Hamburg were 1.5 percent, 2.2 percent, 3.5 percent, and 4 percent. The rise in losses did reflect a surprisingly quick recovery by the defenses, but aircraft losses were fewer than those suffered during the Battle of the Ruhr. 121 The destruction was the greatest success that Bomber Command would achieve for the next year and a half. It represented "area" bombing in its most devastating and awesome aspects. Out of 122,000 apartments, the raids destroyed or damaged 40,000 and out of 450,000 houses, 250,000. Seventy-five percent of the electric works, 60 percent of the water system, and 90 percent of the gas system were 168   ## p. 169 (#189) ############################################  ATTRITION ON THE PERIPHERY knocked out of commission. The fall off in industrial production was considerable: 40 percent for large firms and 80 percent for medium and small concerns. 122 The impact on German leadership was considerable. Goebbels could not believe the first reports of the second raid's effects. 123 Speer informed Hitler that six more attacks on this scale would "bring Germany's armaments production to a halt." Hitler, however, replied that Speer would straighten things out. 124 In retrospect, Hitler was correct, not because Speer was wrong in an estimate that six more Hamburgs would halt armament production, but because Hamburg was a unique success, depending on peculiar circumstances: a period of warm, dry weather; the blinding of German defenses; and the location of the city on the Elbe estuary which gave an excellent radar echo. The success, however, was misleading for the conditions rarely reoccurred. For Harris, Hamburg represented the final confirmation that his "area" bombing campaign was on the right track. He would persevere on this course and take his command and crews down a long, dark corridor in the Battle of Berlin. Bomber Command's subsequent success in smashing the rocket exp
