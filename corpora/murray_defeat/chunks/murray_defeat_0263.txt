on the right track. He would persevere on this course and take his command and crews down a long, dark corridor in the Battle of Berlin. Bomber Command's subsequent success in smashing the rocket experimental station at Peenem√ºnde indicated both the dangers ahead as well as the possibility of other avenues. For the first time in a major attack on Germany, the command used a "master bomber," who remained over the target throughout the raid and controlled the bombing. A new and improved marker bomb also contributed to the success. Whatever the delay the raid caused the rocket programs, and there is some question on this point, 125 there is no question that the new methods contributed to an accurate, well-placed bomb pattern. However, the German defenses were already on the road to recovery; the raiding force of 597 aircraft lost 40 bombers (6.7 percent) with a further 32 damaged (for a loss and damage rate of 12.1 percent). 126 Thus, at the end of August, Bomber Command was fresh from its great triumphs of high summer, but additional problems and questions arose that required resolution before Harris could be proven correct in his belief that "strategic" bombing would be the decisive factor in the war. While Bomber Command was posing an increasing threat to the security of Germany's cities at night, American daylight "strategic" bombing forces were also building up in England. By late spring 1943, considerably later than Allied planners had hoped, American bombers were ready to try out the theories of precision bombing attacks by self-defending formations in the skies over the Reich. The considerable delay in the launching of this offensive resulted from the siphoning off of American air resources to the Mediterranean in November 1942. The forces remaining in England represented a fraction of what American airmen felt they needed to accomplish their campaign. Nevertheless, as suggested earlier, Eaker had seen nothing in the first operations that suggested that daylig
