resented a fraction of what American airmen felt they needed to accomplish their campaign. Nevertheless, as suggested earlier, Eaker had seen nothing in the first operations that suggested that daylight, precision, unescorted bombing was not a viable proposition. In fact, Eaker firmly believed that Eighth Air Force could eventually dispense with fighter protection and operate in the depths of the Reich in great unescorted formations. In October 1942, he wrote Spaatz that: 169   ## p. 170 (#190) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT The second phase, which we are about to enter, is the demonstration that day bombing can be economically executed using general fighter support . . . in getting through the German defensive fighter belt and to help our cripples home through this same belt; the third phase will include deeper penetrations into enemy territory, using long-range fighter accompaniment of the P-38 type in general support only and continuing the use of short- range fighters at critical points on a time schedule; the fourth phase will be a demonstration that bombardment in force-a minimum of 300 bombers can effectively attack any German target and return without excessive or uneconomical losses. This later phase relies upon mass and the great firepower of the large bombardment formations. 127 128 With limited numbers of aircraft and beset by maintenance problems, Eighth Air Force launched relatively weak raids onto the continent. Between November 1942 and mid-March 1943, only two attacks numbered more than 100 bombers. Only in May 1943 did its force structure allow Eighth to launch 200 bombers on a regular basis. Nevertheless, in the early spring of 1943, American bombers began more dangerous forays into continental airspace. These first raids quickly indicated the price that German fighter forces could extract. On April 17, 115 aircraft attacked the Focke Wulf factory near Bremen; the Germans shot down 16 bombers (13.9 percent) and d
