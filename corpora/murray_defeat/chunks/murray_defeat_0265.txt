raids quickly indicated the price that German fighter forces could extract. On April 17, 115 aircraft attacked the Focke Wulf factory near Bremen; the Germans shot down 16 bombers (13.9 percent) and damaged 46 (40 percent). 129 The sortie loss rate in May dropped because the targets were less dangerous and because the number of available aircraft climbed faster than losses inflicted by the Germans. Finally, in late spring of 1943, Eaker received reinforcements that raised his dispatchable strength to 300-plus bombers-a level which he and other Eighth Air Force commanders believed would allow daylight, unescorted missions into the heart of the Reich. As Eaker had written Spaatz in October 1942, his senior officers were "absolutely convinced that 300 bombers can attack any target in Germany with less than 4 percent losses."'130 As with the concept of deep penetration, unescorted raids, American target selection showed the imprint of prewar doctrine as well as ongoing war-time experience. In the former case, the size of deep penetration formations showed a great increase over prewar estimates as to what was necessary to insure the survival of bombers. In the latter case, the target priority list laid down by the Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO) Plan was a mixture of doctrine and reality. Because the discussions leading to selection of bombing priorities have received attention elsewhere,131 an examination of the final list will serve our purposes. The priority list of targets in the final plan was: (1) Intermediate Objectives: German fighter strength. (2) Primary Objectives: German submarine yards and bases. The remainder of the German aircraft industry. Ball bearings. Oil (contingent upon attacks against Ploesti from Mediterranean). (3) Secondary Objectives: Synthetic rubber and tires. Military motor transport vehicles. 132 170   ## p. 171 (#191) ############################################  ATTRITION ON THE PERIPHERY The placement of German fighter strength at the top
