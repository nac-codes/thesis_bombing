The targeting of U-boat yards and bases reflected the military reality of the Battle of the Atlantic in which Allied sea and air forces were only now beginning to dominate the submarine. Further, the presence of petroleum, synthetic rubber, and ball bearing industries drew directly from prewar theories which had attempted to identify "bottleneck" industries, the destruction of which would cause the failure of the whole economic structure. The ball bearing industry itself was the classic weak link posited by American Air Corps Tactical School thinkers. This is not to say that the selection of ball bearings was entirely an American idea; there were important figures within the Air Ministry who argued persuasively in 1943 that Bomber Command also should attack the ball bearing factories. 133 In June 1943, Eighth Air Force launched two major raids into German airspace beyond fighter escort range. The first, on June 13, attacked two targets: the main force, Bremen; and a smaller force, Kiel. Of the 228 aircraft dispatched, Eighth lost 26 (a loss rate of 11.4 percent). Nine days later, B-17's and B-24's struck the I.G. Farben synthetic rubber plant at Hüls. While the main and secondary forces lost 20 bombers (6.7 percent), the raid was one of the more successful in the war. It shut down the plant for a full month and reduced rubber stocks to a one-and-a-half month supply. As with the Möhne Dam, Allied bombers did not return and the Germans repaired the damage. In March 1944, Hüls reached peak production for the war. 134 For most of July, weather conditions prevented Eighth Air Force from attacking Germany. In the month's last week, however, excellent flying condi
