ch 1944, Hüls reached peak production for the war. 134 For most of July, weather conditions prevented Eighth Air Force from attacking Germany. In the month's last week, however, excellent flying conditions occurred and Eaker mounted his most ambitious operations. Eighth attacked Hamburg on July 25 and again on the 26th (along with Hanover). On July 28 and 30th, the American bombers hit Kassel and assorted targets and on the 29th attacked Kiel and Warnemünde. These operations did not come lightly. Ferocious German opposition cost Eighth Air Force 87 bombers. 135 Despite the losses, these operations signalled the arrival of American fighters as a factor in the air battle. On July 28, P-47's, equipped for the first time with drop tanks, caught German fighters attacking B-17 stragglers; on the 30th, escort fighters again caught the Germans and inflicted heavy losses. While these first drop tanks only extended P-47 range by 30-plus miles, the presence of American fighters deeper on the continent portended serious implications for German defenses. 136 Extensive operations at the end of July exhausted and attrited Eighth's forces so that available strength fell below 300; not until August 12 did the Americans return to skies over the Reich. The attack on the Ruhr indicated no weakening of German opposition; 25 bombers out of 330 dispatched fell (a 7.5 percent loss rate). 137 On August 17, Eaker launched his bombers against Schweinfurt and Regensburg in one of the most famous and costly raids of the war. The latter attacks aimed at destroying the Messerschmitt complex-an obvious effort to strike at the source of Luftwaffe fighter strength. Within Schweinfurt, three major concerns produced 45 percent of the ball bearings used by German industry (52.5 percent in terms of net 171   ## p. 172 (#192) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT ESCORT FIGHTER RANGE O BE HIM)` รฐา พ 175 WITH DROPSTANK 20 MILES 230 MILES SPARTELAE KIEL BREMEN HANOVER HAMBUR BE
