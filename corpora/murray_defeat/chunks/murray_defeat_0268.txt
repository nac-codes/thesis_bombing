Its results shattered the theory that the German defensive system lacked depth. Both formations suffered heavy losses. The Regensburg force lost 24 bombers out of 146 dispatched (16.4 percent) and only the fact that they flew on to North Africa, thereby disconcerting German defenses, prevented heavier losses. 139 In fact, the number of aircraft written off was higher than 24, for the Regensburg forces left approximately 20 B-17's in North Africa when they returned to Europe. 140 The second force, attacking Schweinfurt, received no benefit from the first attack because bad weather had delayed its departure. As a result, German fighters savaged it as thoroughly as they had the Regensburg force. Out of 230 bombers, the Schweinfurt groups lost 36 (15.7 percent). The loss of 60 bombers in one day represented the loss of 10.3 percent of the aircraft in Eighth's operational units and 17.5 percent of its crew strength. 141 By themselves these percentages explain why Eighth did not go back to Schweinfurt until the following October. While the attacking force inflicted substantial damage on the ball bearing works, the bombing concentration and the number of aircraft attacking were insufficient to eliminate Schweinfurt as a production center. • The conduct of the Schweinfurt/Regensburg attack raises interesting questions. The size of the attacking force and
