ble but in some cases as not really necessary. As late as mid-June, even after the heavy losses on the Kiel raid, Eaker placed range extension tanks for fighters fourth on his list of priorities. In fairness to Eaker, his conversations with Robert Lovett, Assistant Secretary of War for Air, led the latter 173   ## p. 174 (#194) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT to give the long-range fighter escort program strong support when he returned to Washington. 144 Such lassitude and lack of direction marked the drop tank engineering program in the United States that VIII Fighter Command and V Fighter Command, operating in New Guinea, had developed rough and workable tanks before the engineers at Wright-Patterson. 145 The results for the bombers of Eighth Air Force show clearly in Tables XXXIII146 and XXXIV. 147 As we shall see in the next section, the loss rate for Luftwaffe units in the west was equally appalling. The question was who could best stand up to the attrition. In the high summer of 1943, the answer was still in doubt. While Eighth Air Force mounted increasingly powerful raids, American air forces in the Mediterranean entered the struggle over Europe. On August 1, Ninth Air Force launched five B-24 groups, 177 bombers, against Rumanian oil fields and refineries near Ploesti. Unfortunately, due to errors, the attack suffered from bad timing and alerted the defenses. While damage was considerable, bomber losses were so heavy, 41 due to enemy action (23.2 percent) and 54 overall (30.5 percent), that American air commanders could not intensify the damage with further raids. 148 Thus, the Germans repaired critical areas and utilized capacity not in use. On August 13, these five groups, diminished in strength, struck the Wiener Neustadt aircraft assembly plant in Austria. Catching the defenses by surprise, they inflicted serious damage with the loss of only two aircraft. 149 The Germans were on notice that American aircraft based in the
