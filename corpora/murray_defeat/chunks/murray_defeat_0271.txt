Catching the defenses by surprise, they inflicted serious damage with the loss of only two aircraft. 149 The Germans were on notice that American aircraft based in the Mediterranean could strike deep onto the continent. 150 The situation would become increasingly serious for the Reich as Allied armies invaded the Italian mainland and captured airfields in southern Italy. THE DEFENSE OF THE REICH The period with which this chapter deals was a time when quite literally the roof over the Reich caved in. How Germany's defenses and its leaders responded determined the fate of the Reich's cities and the length of the war. While military events and production decisions taken in the 1940-41 time frame had sealed Nazi Germany's fate, strategic decisions taken in 1943 determined how events would unfold.
