first, creation of two authorities responsible for air defense in the west proved mistaken. As early as the fall of 1941, Mölders argued for a unified fighter command to defend western Europe. 153 In 1943, Milch urged Göring to unify under one commander all the Luftwaffe's air defense assets, system which he suggested would possess similarity to the British Fighter Command. 154 Göring, however, refused. As a result, until the collapse in France in August 1944 effectively eliminated Luftflotte 3, the Reich's air defense remained split between two competing organizations. While this splitting of responsibility presented serious problems for day fighter operations, it really exacerbated the difficulties of coordinating operations of scarce night fighter forces between two separate commands, adding enormously to the burden of an effective night defense. While the German high command had ignored Bomber Command's depredations in 1942, it could not do so in 1943. The attacks on the Ruhr in March and April pointed out that Germany faced an extraordinary threat to her cities. Hitler was furious at the Luftwaffe's failure to protect the Ruhr, and Göring's prestige was nearly exhausted as the Führer made clear to Goebbels. 155 The response of many German leaders to the March attacks was that Germany must launch reprisal raids at such a level that the British would call off Bomber Command. Even Milch, who throughout 1943 was the most clear headed on the need for an effective air defense, called in March for reprisal raids. As he told his staff, "Our entire armaments effort . . . is dependent on whether we can clear our own skies by carrying out the appropriate attacks on the British home base either on their airfields or on their industry or on their civilians and cities."'156 Hitler's immediate response to the British attacks was to demand that the Luftwaffe drastically strengthen the flak forces despite objections from his air force adjutant. 157 That debate continued throug
