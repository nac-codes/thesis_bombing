ler's immediate response to the British attacks was to demand that the Luftwaffe drastically strengthen the flak forces despite objections from his air force adjutant. 157 That debate continued throughout the year. Bomber Command's ability to swamp the night fighter defenses of the tightly controlled Kammhuber line led several Luftwaffe officers to suggest radical changes. In late spring, Major Hajo Herrmann, a former bomber pilot, pushed a scheme to concentrate a force of day fighters directly over a target and to use searchlights as well as light reflecting from the bombing to attack the bomber stream. Such a tactic, he suggested, would allow night defenses to throw a concentration of force at the bomber stream at the point where it was most vulnerable to visual interception. 158 In a late June report on fighter defenses in the west, Milch supported Herrmann and suggested that the night fighter corps receive responsibility for the night defense over France. 159 Others argued for a more basic 177   ## p. 178 (#198) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT GERMAN AIR DEFENSE- OCT 1943 LUFTFLOTTE BOUNDARIES 2 FIGHTER DIVISION FIGHTER DIVISION LUFTFLOTTE REICH 4 FIGHTER DIVISION 3 FIGHTER DIVISIÓN LUFTFLOTTE 3 5 FIGHTER DIVISION 6132 178 18   ## p. 179 (#199) ############################################  ATTRITION ON THE PERIPHERY restructuring of the defenses. Shortly before Hamburg, Göring's staff was requesting better radar sets to support a pursuit force that would not be tied directly to GCI sites but would search out and follow the bomber stream. 160 The use of "Window" over Hamburg forced the Germans to restructure the defense system far more quickly than they would have otherwise. Herrmann already had begun to gather and to train his force before the raids; the collapse of the night defense system caused the Luftwaffe to commit his small unit on the night of the fire storm. A number of night fighters also freelanced over the burning ci
