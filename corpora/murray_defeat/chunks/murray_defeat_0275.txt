before the raids; the collapse of the night defense system caused the Luftwaffe to commit his small unit on the night of the fire storm. A number of night fighters also freelanced over the burning city. Unfortunately for the Germans, these forces were not numerous enough to inflict substantial damage on the bomber force, although raid losses did increase from 1.5 percent to 2.2 percent. However, many German night fighters in their boxes to the north and to the south of the inferno were not allowed to freelance despite the fact that they could see bombers. 161 Substantial reforms were soon in motion. Herrmann's force rapidly increased in size. As early as July 27, a staff paper urged creation of a large night fighter force in Holland that controllers would vector into the bomber stream. It would then fly with the bombers, shooting down British aircraft until it ran out of ammunition or fuel. 162 This tactic, soon known by the code name "Tame Sow," eventually became the keystone of the Reich's defense system. The possibilities of the new system showed clearly in the Peenemünde raid of August 17. Because German controllers fell for an RAF spoof and reported that Berlin was the main target, they vectored the defending forces to the capital. Not until the last minutes of the raid did fighters arrive over the target. Nevertheless, they shot down 24 bombers over Peenemünde and a further 16 elsewhere along the raid's path. 163 Along with the British night offensive, the Germans now faced an American daylight offensive. Because of a desperate shortage of day fighters, the Luftwaffe threw its night fighter force into the battles against Eighth Air Force. The use of the night fighters to meet the American threat typified the short-sighted, short-range calculation of much of the Luftwaffe's effort in the latter period of the war. Night fighter aircraft represented a sizeable investment in terms of equipment, technology, training, and the specialized skills needed by the crews.
