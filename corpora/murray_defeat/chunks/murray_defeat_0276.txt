uftwaffe's effort in the latter period of the war. Night fighter aircraft represented a sizeable investment in terms of equipment, technology, training, and the specialized skills needed by the crews. The commitment of the night force to daylight operations brought with it corresponding high losses. As early as April, an "Ultra" intercept indicated a willingness to use night fighters during daytime when Göring forbade the use of night pilots with more than 20 victories on day operations. 164 Anglo-American attacks on August 17 and 18th caused the loss of 30 night fighters with 35 more damaged. Twenty-one were lost in daylight operations alone, and a senior staff officer remarked that the Bf 110 should not be used in daytime when it might come into contact with British or American fighters—a remark that might have had some uniqueness in the summer of 1940 but seems somewhat out of place in 1943.165 Hamburg brought to the fore the question of Germany's response. On July 30, Milch warned his staff in the Air Ministry that Germany could only look forward to an intensification of the enemy's air offensive. "What has happened in Hamburg had never before happened [in air war]." If Germany could not master the threat, 179   ## p. 180 (#200) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT she would face a desperate situation. Milch further announced that Hitler had put top priority on air defense and on production of day and night fighters as well as the flak. Fighter productions was to rise to 2,000 aircraft per month by the summer of 1944, and the eastern front would have to make-do until the Luftwaffe mastered the air threat. 166 Milch had earlier in the war not found his desire for increased fighter production to the liking of everyone on the Air Staff. He now discovered a less- than-unanimous agreement with his emphasis on the defense of the Reich. One colonel suggested that a diversion of Bf 110's from the front to night fighters was "unthinkable." Mi
