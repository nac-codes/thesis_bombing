y 1943, the Reichsmarschall suggested increases in the day fighter forces but not because of worries over Allied aircraft production, rather the emphasis was on fighters for the fighter bomber mission. 170 Even Galland, who was pushing for a major increase in the fighter force, did not appear to recognize the threat in the west. In January, he predicted that the main weight of the air war would lie in the Mediterranean throughout the year. 17ยน Thus, the heavy commitment of fighter forces to the defense of Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy received support from the man who later in the year became one of the strongest advocates of beefing up the Reich's defenses. Why Galland held such a position is clear from a remark he made in February that his fighters had solved the problem of fighting four-engine bombers (by day). 172 What the Luftwaffe had not yet faced was the problem of dealing with hundreds of bombers that American industry would throw at the Reich in the summer of 1943 as well as the thousands in 1944. In early 1943, the Luftwaffe with major commitments in the Mediterranean and on the eastern front left the day defense of the west on the same basis on which it 180   ## p. 181 (#201) ############################################  ATTRITION ON THE PERIPHERY had rested in previous years. Some 250 to 300 fighters, scattered from Holland to Brittany, scrambled in small formations to meet the American thrusts. 173 The resulting lack of fighter concentration made it difficult to dent the "Fortress" formations and put the Germans at considerable disadvantage in fending off Allied fighters. By June, the western fighter defenses were breaking down as Luftflotte 3 reported that its fighters were suffering heavy losses in intercepting "Fortress" formations accompanied by numerous fighters. 174 In mid-June, Milch reported after a trip to the west that morale among the fighter pilots was excellent, but the number of available aircraft was "much too weak." He urged that the Luftw
