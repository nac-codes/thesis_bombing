uftwaffe lost 335 single-engine fighters in the west. 179 Admittedly, a percentage of these losses was not directly attributable to combat, but the pressure of stepped-up air operations and losses forced the Luftwaffe to rely increasingly on partially trained pilots. Thus, noncombat losses reflected the pressures of combat attrition. July's losses in the west represented 18.1 percent of all single-engine fighter strength on July 1, reflecting not only the impact of the heavy daytime raids but also the fact that drop tanks on the P-47's had extended escort range. With new range capability, American fighters could catch German pilots deeper within the Reich's airspace. This escalation in the level of fighting over German airspace had an effect on all theaters. By the end of July, the Luftwaffe had put limitations on the employment of fighter aircraft on tasks other than defense of the Reich, while it pulled Bf 110 squadrons out of Brittany and the Battle of the Atlantic to return to Germany. 180 July's efforts placed a great strain on Eighth's capabilities, and in August the aircraft dispatched to targets in Germany showed a significant drop. 181 Losses, 181   ## p. 182 (#202) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT depressingly for the crews involved, showed no such decline. The Schweinfurt/Regensburg disaster added measurably to the month's losses, and for the third straight month crew losses were in excess of 30 percent (see Table XXXIV). The German situation was not much better. August 17 cost the Germans no less than 24 single-engine fighters shot down, 12 Bf 110's destroyed, plus an additional 10 single-engine fighters and 2 Bf 110's written off because of battle damage. Thus, the Germans lost no less than 48 fighters destroyed with a further 25 damaged. The German success over Schweinfurt had not come cheaply nor did fighter operations over the course of the month. By the end of August, the Germans had lost 248 single-engine fighters (
