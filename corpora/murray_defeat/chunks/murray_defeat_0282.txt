. That curious blindness which led him in early 1942 to wonder what the Luftwaffe would do with 360 fighters had now led his air force and nation into a hopeless situation. The battles on the periphery had quite literally stripped the Luftwaffe of whatever chance it had to build up a reserve, and Jeschonnek had accepted those commitments with scarcely a murmur. In addition, it is worth taking a closer look at the general picture of German losses; they reveal that in this period the Luftwaffe had suffered a terrible rate of attrition throughout the force structure. From January through June 1943, the average monthly attrition rate for all aircraft was 13.6 percent. For combat aircraft, the statistics were even more depressing: the bomber attrition rate was 16 percent per month and for fighters it was 19.9 percent. 183 Crew losses were no less significant and more dangerous. While one can replace aircraft, crew replacements 182   ## p. 183 (#203) ############################################  ATTRITION ON THE PERIPHERY and skill level became increasingly difficult to maintain. This was the fourth straight year in which heavy attrition had taken place. It is, therefore, remarkable that the Germans maintained the level of tenacity and competence that they showed throughout the year. While pilot losses for most aircraft types are difficult to determine because crew loss reports included all flying personnel, the situation with regards to single-engine aircraft indicates what was happening to the force structure. For the first three months of 1943, fighter pilot losses ran at a fairly constant rate of between 6 percent and 9 percent per month. However, as a result of heavy fighting in Tunisia, pilot losses climbed to over 12 percent in May and by July were 16 percent. Thus, in the first half of the year, fighter pilot losses equalled 67 percent of the crews present at the beginning of the year. 184 For overall loss trends, see Tables XXXV,185 XXXVI,186 XXXVII,187 and XXXVI
