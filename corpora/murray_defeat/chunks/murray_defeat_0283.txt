the first half of the year, fighter pilot losses equalled 67 percent of the crews present at the beginning of the year. 184 For overall loss trends, see Tables XXXV,185 XXXVI,186 XXXVII,187 and XXXVIII. 188 This attrition was only a foretaste of what happened in July and August. In those two months, the Luftwaffe fought three great air battles and on each one of the three fronts the Germans lost more than 1,000 aircraft. 189 In combat units, the attrition rate reached a level that no military force could long sustain. Fighter losses were 31.2 percent for July and 36 percent for August, while bomber losses were 27.3 percent in July and 32 percent in August. 190 As with the January through June period, only fighter pilot losses are readily attainable. They are clear enough: In July, the Germans lost 16 percent of single-engine fighter pilots available on July 1; in August, they lost 15.6 percent. 191 The impact of the pressure exerted by three different fronts forced the Germans to shut the air war down somewhere. Given the threat posed by the American bombers, there was no other alternative but to defend the Reich. Thus, the air war in the east and in the Mediterranean, with one final gasp in September to meet the invasion of Italy, became subsidiary theaters for the Luftwaffe. Allied air forces dominated the skies over and behind these two fronts, and the German soldier would see little of his air force for the remainder of the war. The disastrous rate of attrition was a reflection both of combat losses and numerous aircraft losses through noncombat causes. In fact, the Luftwaffe seems to have almost been in a race with its opponents to see who could destroy the most German aircraft. After a fairly respectable showing in 1940, from 1941 through 1944 the Luftwaffe lost between 40 percent and 45 percent of its total losses through noncombat causes. 192 The surprising element in such an accident rate is the fact that until the spring of 1944, few in the general staff
