Jeschonnek and his staff had ignored the mess that Udet made of production and had as a result voiced no alarm about continued production stagnation as the Luftwaffe prepared to attack Russia. The growing gap between German and Allied production began to emerge in devastating form in the attrition battles of summer 1943. Since late 1942, Milch had indeed done wonders with German production. In 1943, the aircraft industry produced 64 percent more aircraft than in 1942, with a dramatic increase of 125.2 percent in fighter production and 31.4 percent in bombers. By May 1943, industry produced 1,000 fighters for the first time; by July, production reached 1,263.19% It was not enough. The attrition was such that for the first half of the year, there was a slow but steady increase in fighter and bomber strength. However, in July and August, despite production efforts, the number of aircraft in frontline units began to decline noticeably. In addition, the percentage of authorized aircraft also began to fall (see Table XXXIX197).
