Milch again stands out in his recognition of the danger. He seems to have made a sustained effort to make Hitler as well as Göring understand the problem. 198 Hitler, however, remained unconvinced. In early July, Kammhuber presented him with a proposal for a radical restructuring of Germany's air defenses to meet massive Allied air production. Hitler, however, demanded the origin of these "crazy numbers" and added that "if the numbers on Allied production were correct, then he would have to stop the offensive in the east and concentrate everything on air defense." The figures, however, he assured Kammhuber were false. 199 Milch did get Hitler's approval for an infusion of aircraft into western air defenses in July but was unable to get a firm commitment from the Führer to build up air defenses for the long term.

Interestingly, there was a recognition for a time on the part of some bomber commanders that their air units might find better employment in defending the Reich than
