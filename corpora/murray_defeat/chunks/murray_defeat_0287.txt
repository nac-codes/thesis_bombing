of bombers was doomed to failure. Interestingly, there was a recognition for a time on the part of some bomber commanders that their air units might find better employment in defending the Reich than in raiding Britain. 200 Hitler's emphasis on retaliation rather than air superiority led the Germans into another serious error. The army and air forces were both about to produce their own retaliation weapons: the army with the A-4 (later called the V-2) and the Luftwaffe with the V-1. The V-2 was a triumph of German engineering but certainly was not a monument to good sense. As a weapon, it represented extremely complex technology, it was expensive, it used scarce raw materials, and its production overloaded the instrument and electrical components industry. However, the V-1, a simpler piece of technology, was inexpensive and did not place a serious strain on German industrial production. In addition, because of its vulnerable launch and flight characteristics, it provided a much greater distraction to British defenders. 201 The last point deserves further elaboration: There was no defense against the V-2. However, the V-1 with its requirement for both a launching ramp and its vulnerable flight path kept a significant portion of Allied air forces busy in 1944 bombing the European continent and chasing V-1's through the skies over Great Britain. Unfortunately for Germany's cities, the critical production choices that German air strategy faced in the summer and fall of 1943 were made by individuals who did not possess the background to make intelligent decisions. Hitler, while he knew much about army weaponry and the conduct of ground operations, did not understand the technology or conduct of the air war. The fact that he consistently relied on GÃ¶ring did nothing to enhance his knowledge, for the Reichsmarschall's technical expertise was severely lacking. Having once admitted that he did not know how to turn on his radio, he exhibited his scientific knowledge for his
