ce his knowledge, for the Reichsmarschall's technical expertise was severely lacking. Having once admitted that he did not know how to turn on his radio, he exhibited his scientific knowledge for his staff in discussing German radar sets: "I have frequently taken a look inside such sets. It does not look all that imposing-just some wires and a few other bits and pieces— and the whole apparatus is remarkably primitive even then. . . .''202 In another case in February 1943 after Milch urged the inclusion of more women in the production process, Göring suggested that perhaps the best method to include women in the war effort would be to allow them to do the work at home where they would also be able to watch their children. A somewhat flabergasted Milch could only reply that German industry was more advanced than that. 203 The failure to understand modern production and technical problems resulted in a failure to include fully scientists and technicians in the war effort. The services often drafted highly trained and skilled individuals and used them in positions in which their gifts and expertise were minimized. 204 Finally, there was often a failure of designers to talk to production people. The most remarkable example of this was the interaction between the developers of the A-4 rocket and those who were attempting to get it into production. 205 The lack of cooperation between these two groups may, in fact, have been more damaging to the rocket's progress than the raid on Peenemünde. As this study has suggested at several points, one of the critical elements in modern warfare is the productive capacity of industry and its use. By the summer of 1943, German strategy was already severely hampered by the choices and decisions 189   ## p. 190 (#210) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT made in the 1940-41 period that had failed to mobilize the European economy for a great struggle.
