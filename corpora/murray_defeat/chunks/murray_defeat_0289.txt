####################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT made in the 1940-41 period that had failed to mobilize the European economy for a great struggle. Now in the summer of 1943, German leaders faced the choice of either radically restructuring the aircraft industry for a massive output of day and night fighters at the expense of other types or facing defeat in the air over the Reich. Milch himself had suggested a target of 5,000 fighters per month to Hitler in March.206 But the top leadership was unwilling to address a military threat with a military response. In fact, the real triumph and impact of Bomber Command's "area" bombing campaign in 1943 was the fundamental distortion it caused in German armaments programs. The anger and desire for a retaliation strategy was particularly clear in the case of Hitler, but even as intelligent and rational an individual as Speer could not resist the attraction of paying the British back in kind. At the end of May 1943, the Armaments Minister suggested to a most enthusiastic and appreciative audience in the Ruhr that while "German mills of retribution may often seem to grind too slowly, they do grind very fine. . . ." Speer had just seen a successful firing of an A-4, and his continued support for the rocket program throughout 1943 and 1944 caused a major diversion of German production capacity and raw materials that would have been far better spent in defending German airspace, 207 While in a larger sense, the moral questions involved in the "strategic" bombing offensives can never be satisfactorily answered, the question of the military utility of the campaigns is, however, easier to address. By late summer 1943, British "area" bombing attacks and the American precision bombing campaign were having a major impact on the war. In the first case, the real contribution of Bomber Command was indirect, even though it caused more direct damage to the German nation. The problem was the fact that so much of German industry lay on the fringe area
