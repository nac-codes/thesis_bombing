se, the real contribution of Bomber Command was indirect, even though it caused more direct damage to the German nation. The problem was the fact that so much of German industry lay on the fringe areas of the cities that the command was blasting into rubble. This distortion that the campaign caused in the German war effort, however, was enormous. Not only did it result in such highly unproductive efforts as the A-4 program but it pushed the Germans into continuing production of bombers for retaliatory raids far too long. Moreover, the A-4 program kept the Germans from ever properly investigating a promising antiaircraft rocket system. 208 Also important was the fact that the growing number of British raids caused a substantial distortion in the manufacturing process for artillery and ammunition. By summer 1943, no less than 89 flak batteries defended Berlin.209 The growth from 1940 in the number of flak batteries was sizeable. From a level of 791 heavy batteries (88's, 105's, and 128's) in 1940, to 967 in 1941, to 1,148 in 1942, and to 2,132 in 1943, German flak forces represented an enormous investment in equipment and manpower.210 All of these batteries expended prodigious amounts of ammunition 24 hours a day. Unfortunately for the Germans, the results were more visually spectacular than damaging. The 88mm flak 36 weapon seems to have required an average expenditure of 16,000-plus shells to bring down one aircraft flying at high altitude, and that was the weapon with which most flak batteries were equipped. 211 As for the Allied effort, American daylight precision bombing had not yet achieved the spectacular results that Bomber Command had thus far caused. In fact, 190   ## p. 191 (#211) ############################################  ATTRITION ON THE PERIPHERY the American campaign had only recently begun and was in serious trouble, considering American losses in deep penetration raids. Nevertheless, Eighth's forces represented a more immediate threat to German arm
