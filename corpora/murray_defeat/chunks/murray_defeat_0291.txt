ican campaign had only recently begun and was in serious trouble, considering American losses in deep penetration raids. Nevertheless, Eighth's forces represented a more immediate threat to German armament production as well as a longer range danger to the Luftwaffe as an effective military force. In the first case, as the Germans recognized early on, the Americans were going after critical elements within their economic structure. The attack on the rubber factory at HÃ¼ls had underscored this intent. Speer found the August attack on Schweinfurt even more dangerous. As he told RAF investigators after the war, a concentrated offensive on the ball bearings industry would have had the following results: Armaments production would have been crucially weakened after two months, and after four months would have been brought completely to a standstill. This, to be sure, would have meant: One: All our ball bearing factories (in Schweinfurt, Steyr, Erkner, Cannstatt, and in France and Italy) had been attacked simultaneously. Two: These attacks had been repeated three or four times, every two weeks, no matter what the pictures of the target area showed. Three: Any attempt at rebuilding these factories had been thwarted by further attacks, spaced at two-month intervals.2 212 The difficulty was that no matter what the prospects, Eighth did not have sufficient strength to carry out such an offensive even had it done nothing except bomb ball bearing factories. One Schweinfurt every two months came close to destroying it as an effective force. Another Schweinfurt in this period might have ended Eighth's entire daylight offensive. Thus, the August raid warned the Germans to look for alternative sources of supply; the second attack in October redoubled their efforts at dispersal and substitution. The February 1944 bombing by the RAF did more damage than the American raids but came well after Speer's precautionary measures had taken effect. The assault on the German aircraft industry
