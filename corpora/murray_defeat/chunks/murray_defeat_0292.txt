titution. The February 1944 bombing by the RAF did more damage than the American raids but came well after Speer's precautionary measures had taken effect. The assault on the German aircraft industry was probably in retrospect more damaging to the war effort. The July-August attacks on factories producing aircraft resulted in a fall off in production of approximately 200 fighters. By November, fighter production was 300 under peak production in July.213 Also important was the attrition that Eighth's attacks were already imposing on the defending fighter forces. If for the short run it was questionable as to who was taking the more severe beating, there was no question that in the long run Eighth Air Force had better prospects. And month by month, American fighters were extending their range to the east. CONCLUSION The period between November 1942 and August 1943 was the last opportunity that the Luftwaffe had in the war to build up a reserve so that it could maintain air superiority at least over the Reich. The unwillingness of Germany's leaders, 191   ## p. 192 (#212) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT however, to trade space for time forced the Luftwaffe into a battle of attrition on the periphery. The results of those battles bled the German air force white. At the very moment when the air battles in the Mediterranean and in the east peaked, a terrible new danger appeared in the west. While the German war economy could bear the damage that Bomber Command meted out to German cities (except perhaps in psychological terms), the bomber thrusts of Eighth Air Force aimed at the industrial heart. The Luftwaffe had no choice but to come up and to fight. In the process, its destruction had already begun. 192   ## p. 193 (#213) ############################################  Notes 1.
