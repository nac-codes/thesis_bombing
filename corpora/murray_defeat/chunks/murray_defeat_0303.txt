Webster and Frankland, SAOAG, Vol. II, p. 62. The British official historians claim that "Eighth Air Force chose a full-moon period to make their first attack on August 19 [sic], and, though they carried incendiary bombs in the hopes of lighting the target for a night attack, it must have been obvious that Bomber Command could scarcely carry it out in such circumstances." It is worth noting that on the evening of August 17th when Eighth Air Force bombed Schweinfurt, Bomber Command was over Peenemünde. Even should the moonlit night have been an obstacle to an attack in central Germany, some other date could have been arranged had Harris wished to do so. 144.
