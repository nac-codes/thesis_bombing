utside the range of Oboe, British bombers found it almost impossible to achieve accurate, concentrated bombing in bad weather. Nevertheless, despite problems in the fall, Harris embarked on what he regarded as a war winning strategy. The lengthening nights provided his forces with the darkness needed for the long, deep penetrations to Berlin. Harris decided to destroy the German capital and in early November penned a note to Churchill in which he underlined his successes and future strategy. He listed 19 German cities, including Hamburg, Cologne, Essen, Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Hannover, Mannheim, Rostock, and Kassel, as virtually destroyed; 19 cities as seriously damaged; and a further 9 as damaged. "From the above," he minuted, “you will see that the Ruhr is largely 'out,' and that much progress has been made towards the elimination of the remaining essentials of German war power." He concluded: I feel certain that Germany must collapse before this programme, which is more than half concluded already, has proceeded much further. We have not much further to go. But we must get the USAAF to wade in in greater force. If they will only get going according to plan and avoid such disastrous diversions as Ploesti..., we can get through with it very quickly. We can wreck Berlin from end to end if the USAAF will come in on it. It will cost us between 400-500 aircraft. It will cost Germany the war.6 210   ## p. 211 (#231) ############################################  ATTRITION OVER THE REICH 6°E AACHEN 8°E KASSEL 22/23RD OCTOBER 1943 OUTWARD ROUTE POSITON OF AIRCRAFT AT 20.40 HRS.
