As Table XL' indicates, bomber losses in 1943 had been very heavy; and with the quick recovery of German night defenses from the effects of "Window," there was little prospect that matters would improve in the coming year.

He had displayed little interest in the scientific war in 1942, and as one historian of the bomber offensive noted: "The short point is this. When the Bomber Command missing rate started getting into double figures, then its chiefs got interested in the scientific war of wits, but not before." By 1943, conditions had forced Harris to use scientists but only on his terms. Solly Zuckerman, one of Britain's leading scientists, relates a remarkable story about meeting Harris in early 1944. Portal sent Zuckerman to High Wycombe, Bomber Command's headquarters, to pass along his scientific work on bombing in the Mediterranean theater. A bizarre evening began with Harris bitterly denouncing Eaker's transfer and characterizing the American as a man who “understood... the vital importance of the strategic bombing of Germany, which he thought that Spaatz appreciated not at all." During the entire evening during which reconnaissance photographs of bombed-out German towns appeared, Harris asked not one question about Zuckerman's studies. The next morning, Harris finally brought up the subject of the war in the south. 99 He had only one question to put, he said, and he wante
