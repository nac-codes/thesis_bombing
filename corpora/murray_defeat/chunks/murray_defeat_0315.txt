red, Harris asked not one question about Zuckerman's studies. The next morning, Harris finally brought up the subject of the war in the south. 99 He had only one question to put, he said, and he wanted a straight answer, "yes or no-nothing more. "Could heavy bombers be used to bomb coastal defenses?" I paused a second, and then said, "yes." It was clearly not the answer he wanted, and no further word [on the subject] was spoken.‚Åπ One has the feeling that Harris embarked on the "area" bombing of Berlin as a matter of faith. Science and research were useful only insofar as they supported his campaign and arguments. In retrospect, it appears that Harris hoped to win the war in the winter of 1943-44 with Bomber Command alone. He told one senior commander at the time that his (Harris') forces would have to show the world. 10 Unfortunately, there comes a point where the maintenance of the objective crosses the fine line between realistic 212   ## p. 213 (#233) ############################################  ATTRITION OVER THE REICH perserverance and stubborn adherence to preconceived ideas." Haig had crossed that line in 1917; Harris now also crossed that line. In fairness to the Air Marshal, one must note that no other commander in the war bore greater strain. Every night from February 1942 through spring 1945, Harris decided whether his command. would strike or not, a decision on which rested the lives and welfare of his crews. In the 1942-43 period, that strain was particularly heavy in view of difficulties facing Bomber Command. By the fall of 1943, Harris had held his position for a year and three-quarters; he was tired and under great stress. Thus far, he had waged his campaign for the most part with skill, and it is difficult to imagine the bombing effort achieving the same degree of success under another commander. Nevertheless, the Battle of Berlin suggests that a new commander in late 1943 might have shown greater flexibility (never Harris' strongest attribute), t
