ity than the bomber force. Therefore, despite its limitations, the Bf 110 remained the backbone of night fighters. One other major equipment change occurred that had a major impact on bomber losses towards the end of the Battle of Berlin. Frontline squadrons developed an upward firing cannon called schräge Musik. By aligning himself under and slightly behind the wing of an enemy bomber, a night fighter pilot could destroy the engines and set the fuel tanks on fire. Given the loads of fuel and explosives that British bombers carried and their lack of defensive armor, any attack was dangerous. The only possibility of survival was instantaneous, violent evasion. The new schräge Musik allowed fighters to approach bombers unobserved from underneath, as there were no turret gunner on the underside of most British bombers. 18 RAF intelligence remained ignorant of the new tactics since debriefing officers refused to believe the 214   ## p. 215 (#235) ############################################  ATTRITION OVER THE REICH few reports that German fighters were firing upwards while flying underneath the bombers. One critical factor facing the night fighter force was the level of attrition taking place in frontline units. In October, Kammhuber warned Göring at a meeting of fighter generals that crew losses were approaching unacceptable levels. In June, the night fighter force had lost only 12 crews. From then on, losses had climbed rapidly. In July, it lost 38 crews (6.8 percent), in August 57 (9.8 percent), and in September 53 (7.7 percent).19 These rising losses among night fighters reflected their use during daytime as well as the pressure of operations against the British homeland. The assembled generals found the losses worrisome, and General Martini commented that the night fighter defenses were eating into their capital. Göring, however, was not upset. He remarked that "today, there is a war on" and that losses were inevitable. Noting the loss of 160 crews in four months
