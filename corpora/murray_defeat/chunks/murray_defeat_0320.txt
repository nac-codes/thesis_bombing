ghter defenses were eating into their capital. Göring, however, was not upset. He remarked that "today, there is a war on" and that losses were inevitable. Noting the loss of 160 crews in four months (including June's figures and missing the significance of the rise of crew losses), Göring took comfort in the fact that this worked out to only one and one-third crews lost per night. He claimed that this rate was not shocking when compared to the loss of life caused by the British bombardment. As to the efforts to get more equipment for training units, the Reichsmarschall lamely suggested that perhaps booty seized in Italy after its surrender might compensate for some of the equipment deficiencies.20 At the end of August and beginning of September, lengthening nights allowed Bomber Command to attack Berlin again. The results of three raids and the losses suffered should have served warning for future strategy. Out of 1,179 aircraft claiming to have bombed the capital, only 27 on examination of night camera photographs got within 3 miles of the aiming point. Losses showed a significant rise over the Hamburg raids: The Germans shot down no less than 123 bombers (an overall loss rate of 7.2 percent).21 By the end of September, Göring felt optimistic enough to congratulate his night fighter commanders and crews for their successful recovery and the losses they were inflicting.22 The real offensive against Berlin opened in November with four major raids. The losses in the first stage of the battle were surprisingly low (4 percent of sorties launched on Berlin and 3.6 percent for the overall sortie loss rate). Churchill offered congratulations to Portal and Harris.23 But loss rates were misleading. November's weather conditions were dreadful; and during some raids, German fighters could not get off the ground. The corollary to the safety advantage that such conditions offered was a corresponding drop in bombing accuracy. Conditions made it impossible to mark or to identify
