ers could not get off the ground. The corollary to the safety advantage that such conditions offered was a corresponding drop in bombing accuracy. Conditions made it impossible to mark or to identify targets, and crews had no choice but to drop their loads higgledy-piggledy over Berlin. Considerable damage was done, but no concentrated bombing on the scale of Hamburg and Kassel took place. The damage did shake Speer's confidence, however, and Goebbels after a major raid noted that: "The situation has become ever more alarming in that one industrial plant after another has been set on fire. . . . The sky above Berlin is bloody, deep red, and of an awesome beauty. I just can't stand looking at it." Nevertheless, the Propaganda Minister comforted himself in British overestimations of raid damage and forbade any denials in the hope that the "sooner London is convinced that there 215   ## p. 216 (#236) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT is nothing left of Berlin, the sooner will they stop their offensive against the Reich's capital."'24 The Germans confined post-bombing damage better than in earlier raids through lessons learned at Hamburg. Goebbels ordered evacuation of nearly 1 million Berliners in August and instituted a massive program throughout the Reich's cities to beef up air raid and fire prevention forces. In Berlin, such efforts helped to hold down casualties and damage. 25 In December, Bomber Command's losses began to rise. The first raid on Berlin saw 8.7 percent of the attacking force missing with an average loss of 4.8 percent of sorties dispatched for all four attacks on the capital. Disaster struck in January. Harris launched nine major operations against Germany, six against Berlin, and one each against Stettin, Brunswick, and Magdeburg. The loss rates were terrible. The missing rate on six Berlin raids averaged 6.1 percent of sorties dispatched, while attacks on other cities lost 7.2 percent of their aircraft. The least c
