nd at feeding night fighters directly into the bomber stream. The development of a number of new devices aided the defense. The first step came with the use of British identification, friend or foe (IFF) transmissions to determine the bomber stream's course. When the British caught on and shut off such signals over the continent, the Germans moved to other transmissions that the bombers made. British scientists developed a device, code-named "Monica," to warn bombers that German airborne radar was scanning them; the Germans captured such a device early on and turned it. With the "Flensburg" apparatus, night fighters homed in directly on bombers using "Monica." In addition, the Germans provided fighters with a device called "Naxos," which homed in on H2S transmissions. Not all such measures were German. The British began to use fake controllers, first in 216   ## p. 217 (#237) ############################################  ATTRITION OVER THE REICH England and then airborne in specially built "Lancasters." They confused and gave contradictory information to German fighters.29 When that no longer worked, the British jammed the frequencies used by German controllers. 30 Nevertheless, the general impression of scientific war in this period is that the defense had the upper hand. By January, German night fighters were flying out into the North Sea to intercept the bombers.31 Their successes in that month forced the British to take drastic action. Raid planning became more complex with a number of spoof raids launched with the main effort to deceive defenses. Pathfinders no longer laid route markers to guide the bombers nor could markers indicate course turning points. Such marking devices had pointed out the raid's direction to German fighters and drew them directly into the bomber stream. While such changes helped keep losses down, they decreased bombing accuracy. By January, German commanders had recognized that "tame sow" tactics were proving most effective, although so
