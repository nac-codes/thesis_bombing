mber Command again devastated Essen in an accurate Oboe attack carried out through dense cloud cover. German defenses were off balance, and the British lost only nine bombers.36 The accurate bombing of Essen, however, underlined again how dependent Bomber Command was on navigational devices to achieve accurate bombing patterns. In one raid against Stuttgart (beyond the range of Oboe) earlier in the month, not one aircraft dropped its bombs within city limits.37 On March 30, Bomber Command launched its last deep penetration raid for a considerable period of time as preparations for "Overlord" were about to begin. 217   ## p. 218 (#238) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT This was indeed "a curious operation."38 It reflected serious errors in judgment which, when combined with circumstances such as weather and decisions made by German controllers early in the raid, caused a disaster. In the sense that chance lay largely on Germany's side, the Nuremberg raid was on the opposite end of the spectrum from the Hamburg raids of July and August 1943. Harris initiated the mission in the early morning hours of March 30. Weather was not favorable and the moon would not set until nearly 0200 hours. However, most dangerous for the bombers' survival was the routing that High Wycombe selected for the attacking force. Turning south of Brussels, the bomber stream would fly a route that 5 Group advocated: a straight in, straight out flight plan with few course alterations. The long leg after the turn south of Brussels would carry the bombers between the Ruhr and Colbenz Flak concentrations. Unfortunately, this gap lay immediately in front of night fighter beacons, "Ida" and "Otto." There was nothing surprising about the bomber stream passing close by such beacons that now existed throughout Germany. What was surprising was the fact that the bombers after their turn south of Brussels flew straight at those beacons for 25 minutes and then continued on the s
