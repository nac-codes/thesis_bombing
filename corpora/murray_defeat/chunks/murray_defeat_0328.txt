f the Battle of Berlin, Harris' forces lost 1,128 aircraft, nearly all four-engine bombers. These losses were only marginally above the 813 bombers lost during the Battle of Hamburg and the 923 lost during the Battle of the Ruhr. The results, however, achieved over winter 1943-44 were not close to those of the earlier two battles. That alone contributed to a fall in morale: One can face terrible odds if the results are commensurate. In the Battles of the Ruhr and Hamburg, the achievements were obvious and palpable. The crews could not miss what was happening below to Essen, Hamburg, and Kassel. For the Battle of Berlin, there was no similar run of successes. Bomber Command was close to burning itself out. The losses in the Battle of Berlin were an indication of the scale of losses that the Command would suffer in 1944. Table XLII47 indicates the extent of British bomber losses for the year.

Sustained operations had now continued for over a year and few crews completed their 30 mission obligation. January's losses turned squadrons into short one-way houses for crews on the way to 220   ## p. 221 (#241) ############################################  ATTRITION OVER THE REICH their deaths.48 The drop in morale resulted in more early returns and more aircrew members cashiered for LMF (lacking moral fibre). It also caused some crews to pickle their "cookies" (the 4,000-pound blockbuster) over the North Sea to gain the relative safety of higher altitudes. Air Vice Marshal D.C.T. Bennett, commander of the pathfinders, somewhat uncharitably called such crews "fringe merchants.''49 But Bennett was as hard on himself as he was on his crews. Unlike other group commanders, he had flown a tour
