ing this period should not obscure the fact that the German night fighters also were having a difficult time. Bad weather, the low level of skill among new crews, and defensive fire from the bombers all took their toll. The worst enemy of night fighter crews seems to have been themselves. In a twelve-day period (March 15 to 26th), Nachtgeschwader 6 with two Gruppen (a total strength of between 50 and 60 aircraft) lost 6 aircraft that ran out of fuel, had 2 aircraft damaged by belly landings, and had 1 aircraft force-land in Switzerland. Only two aircraft were lost in combat. 53 Crew losses ran at a steady rate, close to 15 percent for the first three months of 1944.54 While such losses were not light, German crews gained the impression that they were inflicting serious damage on the enemy. Moreover, they were defending German cities from the British bombers, and as a result their loss rate was probably easier to bear. By spring 1944, the night defenses had won a substantial victory over their opponent. They had made the skies over the Reich so dangerous that the British could only infrequently risk the losses involved in deep penetration raids. What the Germans were not able to do, however, was to transfer their success to the skies over the occupied western countries. In that region, Bomber Command posed a different threat and would 221   ## p. 222 (#242) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT soon show that it could inflict important damage on those Germans preparing to meet the invasion. THE DAY BATTLE: VICTORY, SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 1943 We left our account of Eighth Air Force's campaign after the shattering experience of the Schweinfurt/Regensburg attack. Eaker's strength had declined to the point where he had to allow a major lull in operations. In September, only one major raid penetrated deep into German airspace; the results duplicated what had happened over Schweinfurt in August. Forty-five bombers and crews were listed as missing ou
