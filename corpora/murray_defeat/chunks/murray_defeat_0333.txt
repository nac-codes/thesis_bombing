bombing of the ball bearings works was needed almost immediately.61 Yet, as suggested earlier, the first attack on Schweinfurt had alarmed Speer; but the second raid, with 67 percent of Schweinfurt's production knocked out, was even more disturbing.62 The Armaments Minister established a crash program to disperse the bearings industry and to substitute alternative roller bearings for ball bearings where possible. 63 But Speer was worried that the bombing would soon recur. However, no matter what the target's value, Eighth Air Force could not return until fighter escort could reach Schweinfurt. Harris, involved in his offensive against Berlin, had no intention of attacking a "panacea" target. By February, those conditions had changed; Eighth possessed fighter protection that could take it all the way to Schweinfurt, while Harris was more amenable to attacking ball bearings after the losses over Berlin. By then, however, the raids had to begin all over again the process of damaging the production of ball bearings. The disaster at Schweinfurt ended the nonsense about unescorted bomber formations. The losses over the summer had caused a rising chorus of demands for increased fighter range as well as a true long-range escort. The battles in October brought matters to a head. Unfortunately, the development and production of suitable drop tanks involved considerable muddle, particularly in the United States. While some in Washington recognized the importance of range extension tanks, there existed a lack of communication between Eighth and procurement officials at home. American drop tank production had progressed satisfactorily in early 1943, but supply authorities later in the year mistakenly believed that production in Britain could meet Eighth's needs. 64 Meanwhile in England, British industry could not produce the numbers that procurement desired, while Eaker, somewhat as a result of his own emphasis, was left holding a rather empty bag. On October 14, Eaker wrote Ai
