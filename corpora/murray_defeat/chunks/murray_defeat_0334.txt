land, British industry could not produce the numbers that procurement desired, while Eaker, somewhat as a result of his own emphasis, was left holding a rather empty bag. On October 14, Eaker wrote Air Marshal Wilfrid Freeman at the Ministry of Aircraft Production to complain of shortfalls in drop tank production. Not yet aware of Schweinfurt's casualties, Eaker suggested that of 30 bombers lost over MÃ¼nster on the 10th, the availability of drop tanks might have saved as many as 20. Freeman's reply was a model of restraint. He admitted delays but pointed out that current production would cover the shortfall by early November. This deficit, however, in his opinion, was not entirely the fault of the Ministry of Aircraft Production since British industry had not received approval for the required fittings until early October. Freeman pointed to his February warning that British industry, severely overstrained, could not complete a rush order for tanks. Only in June had 223   ## p. 224 (#244) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT Eighth sought large numbers of workable drop tanks. 65 Now after Schweinfurt, everyone pushed the drop tank program, and British production, helped by American efforts, made them available in rising quantities. From November 1943, Eighth felt its way into Germany, but it would go no deeper than its fighter escort could fly; as the escort range rose, the noose tightened. One other element of the escort program deserves attention: the development of a true long-range escort fighter, the "Mustang." Like the "Mosquitoe," the P-51 was an orphan at birth.66 North American developed the "Mustang" in a rush to land a contract with the British. The initial variant, with an Allison engine, possessed good low altitude characteristics but lacked power to work at higher elevations. In the summer of 1942, British engineers, after studying the aircraft, decided that with a better engine, the "Mustang" would possess excellent charac
