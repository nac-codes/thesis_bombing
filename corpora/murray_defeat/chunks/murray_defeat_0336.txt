ed his intention to make them combat-ready as soon as possible. Within four days, the Gruppe had flown its first mission and on the following day was declared combat- ready.69 Fighter strength in Germany rapidly rose. From barely 600 aircraft, fighter numbers rose to 800 by July and nearly 1,000 by early October.70 In addition, substantial numbers of twin-engine fighters redeployed to the Reich so that by mid- October the Luftwaffe had nearly 200 of them available in Germany of which 50 percent were "in commission."" Finally, German commanders still used night fighters during the day despite the heavy loss of aircraft, radar equipment, and skilled crewmembers. Along with a redistribution of fighters, substantial changes took place in the defending forces' tactics and weaponry. By September, the Germans had refined the defense system created in the summer to meet the day threat.

The Germans had altered the armament of the Bf 109's and Fw190's, and their new heavier armament made them a greater threat to the bombers. The single-engine fighters launched head-on and stern attacks in large groups, their cannon fire dangerous to slow-moving bombers. As for logistics, the Luftwaffe stocked a number of bases throughout western and central Germany with ammunition, fuel, and ground crews for quick fighter turnaround, thereby increasing their sortie rate against bomber formations." Interestingly, the Germans were also using drop tanks on their fighters to extend the range and time that the fighters could remain airborne. In October, however, GÃ¶ring scotched the tactic and suggested that even the Americans would not be so wasteful of material. He suggested that crews not drop tanks when empty but only in combat.73 An intercep
