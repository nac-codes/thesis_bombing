hus defense of the Reich's airspace depended on the continued existence of a zone over which Allied fighters could not operate because of their inadequate range. There were already signs that this situation was breaking down. German successes in September and October were won, moreover, at a high cost to themselves. The Germans lost 276 fighters in the west in September (17.4 percent of the total fighter force as of September 1) and 284 more in October (17.2 percent). Schweinfurt itself cost the Germans (see Table XLIII) 31 aircraft destroyed, 12 written off, and 34 damaged. As a percentage, this was between 3.5 percent and 4 percent of total fighter aircraft available in the west. 225   ## p. 226 (#246) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT TABLE XLIII Aircraft Losses, Schweinfurt-October 1943 100 Percent 60-100 Percent Me 410 2 Bf 109 24 11 Bf 110 3 Fw 190 2 1 40-60 Percent 0-40 Percent 1 4 17 6 2 4 Luftwaffe records indicate that the Germans lost no less than 41.9 percent of their fighter force (destroyed or written off) in October." Table XLIV78 indicates the losses among German fighter pilots in late 1943. The level of attrition for both Germany's fighter forces as well as Eighth Air Force during September and October bordered on the point where both were close to losing cohesion and effectiveness as combat forces. In the long run, considering the massive influx of bombers, fighters, and crews already swelling American bases in England, Eighth held the strategic advantage. It was, of course, difficult for the crews who flew to Schweinfurt to recognize that advantage. THE DAY BATTLE: THE PAUSE, NOVEMBER-DECEMBER 1943 Historians of airpower, like other military historians, tend to see their topics in terms of decisive battles and clear-cut turning points. The reality, however, is usually more complex. Thus, Schweinfurt often appears as a decisive defeat, followed by a lull in operations until February 1944 when Eighth Air Force's bombe
