turning points. The reality, however, is usually more complex. Thus, Schweinfurt often appears as a decisive defeat, followed by a lull in operations until February 1944 when Eighth Air Force's bombers supported by long-range fighters smashed the Luftwaffe during "Big Week." Schweinfurt was, of course, a turning point and forced fundamental changes in American doctrine and strategy. For the Germans, however, the pressure eased only marginally after Schweinfurt. Moreover, from the Luftwaffe's perspective, October 14 did not appear as important or decisive as it did for the Americans. The debate within the high command continued unabated, and Göring and Hitler as they had throughout the summer-proved unwilling to address fundamental strategic questions. In early November, Galland warned the fighter forces of Göring's dissatisfaction with their October achievements: The fighter and heavy formations have not been able to secure decisive success in air defense against American four- engined formations. The introduction of new weapons . . . has not appreciably changed the situation. The main reason for the failure is that the Kommandeure and Kapitane [sic] do not succeed in securing attacks in close formation up to the shortest ranges. . . The Reichsmarschall has, therefore, ordered the setting up of an assault Staffel (Sturmstaffel). Its tasks will be to break up the enemy by using more heavily armored fighters in all-out . . . attacks. . . . Then there is no need to discuss here whether this is to be done by shooting down the enemy at the closest range, by employing a new type of weapon, or by ramming.79 226   ## p. 227 (#247) ############################################  ATTRITION OVER THE REICH TABLE XLIV FIGHTER PILOT LOSSES SEPT DEC 1943 - % OF PILOTS LOST EACH MONTH (ALL CAUSES) NUMBER OF PILOTS LOST EACH MONTH (ALL CAUSES) · 20% 10% 343 15.7% 14.5% 339 245 TOTAL FIGHTER PILOT LOSSES 1943 2967 AVERAGE STRENGTH 1943 2105 % LOSS 1943 141% 9.9% 300 10.4% 252 200 SEP
