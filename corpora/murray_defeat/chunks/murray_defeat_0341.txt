ut the cowardice of the assembled pilots.82 Yet, the real problem lay beyond Göring at the highest level. While Hitler had left the Luftwaffe to Göring earlier in the war, he was now enmeshed in its decisionmaking process. The Reichsmarschall served as a buffer to reality and presented the Führer's latest demands to his subordinates. He admitted as much in the fall when, in exasperation to his staff's gloomy reports, he exploded: I could also go to the Führer and to whatever he wished, say: No, mein Führer, this can't be done or that can't be done, this is impossible or that is impossible, . . . or that would cost too many losses, or that would exhaust the Luftwaffe. Thus, could I speak, [and] I could always contradict what he had proposed.' 83 Göring's approach went in another direction and his replies were punctuated with the refrain of "Jawohl, mein Führer." But perhaps the truly insurmountable problem was that Hitler's interest to the end centered on the ground battle. Consequently, he regarded the air war as an embarrassment, threatening arms production and the ability to hold off his enemies on the ground. At one point, he even argued that destruction of Germany's cities "actually works in our favor, because it is creating a body of people with nothing to lose-people who will therefore fight on with utter fanaticism."'84 Such attitudes explain why the leadership placed little emphasis on air defense. A conversation between Göring and Milch in November further amplifies this point and underscores the dread that a defeat in Russia inspired throughout German society in late 1943. Milch suggested that alongside the life-and-death question of the eastern front, he was equally worried about what the homeland would do when American fighters came in the spring of 1944. Göring replied: "When every city in 228   ## p. 229 (#249) ############################################  ATTRITION OVER THE REICH Germany has been smashed to the ground, the German people would still li
