ring replied: "When every city in 228   ## p. 229 (#249) ############################################  ATTRITION OVER THE REICH Germany has been smashed to the ground, the German people would still live. It would certainly be awful, but the nation had lived before there were cities." Milch then suggested that such an occurrence might affect arms production, but Göring was not listening. He asked what was the greater danger, Berlin's destruction or the arrival of the Russians. The latter he noted was the "number one danger.''85 Thus, interest at the top in air defense was but a fleeting occurrence. One can question whether the Reich's air defense ever received the emphasis promised by Hitler in response to Hamburg. In October, Göring suggested to his staff that the German people did not care whether the Luftwaffe attacked British airfields. "All they wished to hear when a hospital or a children's home in Germany is destroyed is that we have destroyed the same in England; then they are satisfied."'86 With Hitler's predilection for retaliation, there was no chance of altering aircraft production in favor of fighters. In fact, conferences between Milch and Göring indicate the Reichsmarschall's definite bias towards bombers. In October, "der Dicke" bitterly reproached Milch for placing too much emphasis on the Reich's defense and for robbing production from the bomber forces. Göring could not believe that American production could ever reach estimated levels, because so many men and so much material would be required.87 Further conversations in November confirmed the leadership's desire for bomber production. On the 23rd, Göring underlined the importance of using fighters as fighter bombers. When the discussion turned to the distribution of future Ju 388 production between night fighter and bomber forces, he expressed himself in favor of the latter.88 On the 28th, Göring went even further and decided to hold down future fighter production in favor of bombers.
