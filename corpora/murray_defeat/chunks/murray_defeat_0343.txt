ight fighter and bomber forces, he expressed himself in favor of the latter.88 On the 28th, Göring went even further and decided to hold down future fighter production in favor of bombers. The Reichsmarschall commented to Fritz Sauckel, Gauleiter and slave labor procurer for the Reich, that the Luftwaffe had to have bombers. Göring: I cannot remain on the defensive; we must also have an offensive. That is the most decisive. Sauckel: The only argument that makes an impression on a racial cousin [the British] is that of retaliation.89 Two factors were working against the defense. First, Hitler and Göring refused to consider an emergency effort to build fighters. This had particular significance in view of American attacks on aircraft factories. Those raids, beginning in the summer of 1943, had already caused a serious drop in fighter production (see Table XLV⁹0).

This decline came at the same time that the Luftwaffe was suffering a high rate of attrition. New production was even more affected as a result of Eighth and Ninth Air Forces' efforts against the Messerschmitt and Focke Wulf factories (see Table XLVI⁹¹).

While the pressure eased somewhat in November,
