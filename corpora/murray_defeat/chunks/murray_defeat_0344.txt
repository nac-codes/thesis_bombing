While the pressure eased somewhat in November, the Germans still faced a substantial threat. The shadow of American escort fighters and the gradual extension of their range lay over all Luftwaffe counterbomber operations. By early October, German intelligence had reported that American fighters were accompanying bombers as far as Hamburg. 92 Eighth's losses in October led the Germans to conclude that during good weather American bombers would have to have fighter escort, and that because of the P-47's limited range the Americans would switch more of their operations to bad weather.93 A December intelligence evaluation warned that day operations, supported by fighters, were already reaching the middle ranges.

In the immediate future, the Germans estimated that Eighth would extend the range of "Lightnings" and "Thunderbolts" by increasing the capacity of their drop tanks. The solution, however, would have to await development of a true long-range fighter. 95 94 German intelligence had no idea how close the Americans were to a solution. From the beginning of November, however, P-47's and P-38's, now equipped with better drop tanks, flew deeper into the Reich. Göring had no desire to recognize the implications.

Göring snapped. . . . "Herr Reichsmarschall,” Galland replied with imperturbable calm, "they will soon
