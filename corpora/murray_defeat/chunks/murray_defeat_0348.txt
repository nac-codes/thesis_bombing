ame close to doubling and, in many cases, actually did double October's attack on Schweinfurt. On December 11, 523 bombers hit Emden; on December 13, 649 bombers attacked a number of targets in Germany; on December 16, 535 hit Bremen; on December 20, 472 attacked Bremen again; on December 22, Eighth hit Osnabrück and Münster; and finally on the 30th, 650 bombers hit Ludwigshafen. The losses in these raids (162) approached those of October (179), but Eighth with fighter escorts and with the influx of new aircraft and crews could stand such attrition much better. 105 This activity shows that the pressure on the Luftwaffe in the last two months of 1943 had eased only marginally. While much of Germany still lay beyond escort 232   ## p. 233 (#253) ############################################  ATTRITION OVER THE REICH range, American operations reaching further to the east caused the Germans serious embarrassment and heavy losses. The December 13 mission against Kiel and Hamburg suggests the increasing complexity and success of the fighter range extension program. Six hundred forty-eight heavy bombers flew the mission with 394 fighter escorts, 41 of which were P-51's. Flying in relays that met contact points along the route, the fighters provided continuous and effective support; Eighth lost only five bombers. 106 German fighter formations refused to tangle with bomber formations supported by large numbers of fighters. At the end of December, Galland and the staff of Jagdkorps I concluded that their new tactics against supported bomber formations had failed. The causes were "(a) the weather, (b) the considerable inferiority of German strength, (c) the impossibility of gathering sufficient strength in an area because of time and distance limitations; result: weak and dispersed fighter attacks."107 Moreover, German fighter losses, although dropping from October's high point, were still high enough to cause considerable worry. In November, the Germans had to write off 21 pe
