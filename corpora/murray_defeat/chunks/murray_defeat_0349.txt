d fighter attacks."107 Moreover, German fighter losses, although dropping from October's high point, were still high enough to cause considerable worry. In November, the Germans had to write off 21 percent of their fighter aircraft because of battle damage and noncombat causes. In December, that percentage rose to 22.8 percent. 108 In normal times, such losses would have been catastrophic. Compared with October and the summer, this loss rate did provide some relief to the fighter force. Nevertheless, this continued expenditure, combined with declining production, explains why there was no numerical recovery of the day fighter force at year's end (see Table LXVIIÂ¹09). TABLE LXVII Frontline Strength and Operational Ready Rate, Fighter Force- August-December 1943 Fighters Authorized Actually Present Percent Operationally Ready Operationally Ready, Percent August 31, 1943 2,228 1,581 71.0 1,019 64.4 September 30, 1943 2,228 1,646 73.9 1,080 65.6 October 31, 1943 2,288 1,721 75.2 1,193 69.3 November 30, 1943 2,244 1,789 79.7 1,140 63.7 December 31, 1943 2,244 1,561 69.6 1,095 70.1 Losses of fighter pilots in November and December also showed a decline from the high point reached in the July-October period. They, however, remained at a level which under other conditions would have represented a crippling drain. In November, nearly 10 percent of the fighter pilots were lost, and in December there was a slight rise to 10.4 percent. That increase reflected American pressure and heralded the attrition that would occur in coming months. 110 In 1943, the fighter force had averaged 2,105 full and partially operational ready pilots present for duty each month. Over the year, a total of 2,967 fighter pilots were killed, wounded, or missing in action. The fighter force's weaknesses at the turn of the year and its defeat in the spring of 1944 can only be understood in the context of past attrition rates. Table XLVIII112 suggests what these losses meant for a frontline unit. 233   ##
