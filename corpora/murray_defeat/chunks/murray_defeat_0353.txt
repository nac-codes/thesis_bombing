de the deep support that such a raid required. 17 The attack again showed the Germans the importance that Eighth Air Force attached to destroying Germany's aircraft industry. A decrypted "Ultra" message noted: 236   ## p. 237 (#257) ############################################  ATTRITION OVER THE REICH The attack against Oschersleben carried out beyond the effective range of fighter escort, for which the enemy must have counted on having heavy losses, again underlies the importance attached to the diminution of German fighter aircraft production. . . . The crushing of the attack and the very considerable losses will presumably limit American daylight activity for some time to the range of escort formations. 118 A sharp rise in Luftwaffe aircraft and crew losses immediately reflected the pressure that Allied day operations exerted on defending forces. In January 1944, the fighter forces wrote off 30.3 percent of their single-engine fighters and had lost 16.9 percent of their crews by month's end. 119 This high attrition of pilots resulted not only from combat operations but also from the continued dilution of the force by inexperienced, ill-trained pilots, who in winter's bad weather conditions were as dangerous to themselves as enemy fighters. One fighter Gruppe at month's end scrambled 21 aircraft for a second sortie at an American bomber formation. The Germans achieved two victories but had four aircraft missing, one crash landing (pilot killed), three pilots abandoning their aircraft by parachute, one aircraft damaged after a belly landing, and three aircraft crashing on takeoff. 120 On January 29, the III Gruppe of the Jagdgeschwader Udet claimed 12 bombers, but out of 28 German aircraft taking off, at least 5 and probably 6 were destroyed; 2 pilots were killed and 1 wounded while 3 parachuted to safety. 121 For the overall trends, Tables LI, 122 LII, 123 LIII, 124 and LIV 125. see At month's end, the Germans still believed that they need not worry about America
