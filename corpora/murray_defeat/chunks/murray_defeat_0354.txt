The delay that January's and February's bad weather imposed on American operations probably worked in favor of the Allies' coming offensive. Before the end of February, a crash program had transitioned a significant number of pilots into P-51's. By mid-month, Eighth possessed 539 P-38J's, 416 P-47D's, and 329 P-51B's. 127 Toward the end of February, the extended period of bad weather broke and the greatest air battle of World War II began. At this point, Doolittle released his fighters from earlier restrictions that had tied escort fighters close to bomber formations. 128 Fighters now attacked German fighters on sight, and Eighth went after the Luftwaffe wherever it existed. With drop tanks that would carry P-51's to Berlin, American operations attacked production facilities throughout the Reich. The bombing offensive did not, however, succeed in its direct mission to destroy aircraft production. German industry responded to the attack on aircraft factories in such outstanding fashion that fighter production rose dramatically in the coming months, but the nature of the target forced the Luftwaffe to come up and to fight. As a result, American fighter escorts decimated the Luftwaffe's fighter force. What later historians called "Big Week," code-named "Argument," began on February 20 with a multitarget attack on the German aircraft industry.
