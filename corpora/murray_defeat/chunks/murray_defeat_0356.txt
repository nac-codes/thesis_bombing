atively easy mission on the 21st, opposition stiffened and Eighth lost 41 bombers and Fifteenth lost 14 on the 22nd, 131 The final two raids of "Big Week" came on February 24 and 25th. Here again, American bomber formations ran into strong reaction from German fighters. Eighth Air Force lost 49 bombers (5 over Rostock, 33 over Gotha, and 11 over Schweinfurt), while Fifteenth Air Force lost 17, for a total of 66 bombers. The heavy emphasis that German fighters gave to attacking the bombers resulted in a loss of only 10 American fighters during the day. 132 Opposition on the following day was no less severe. From England, Eighth launched 820 bombers and 899 fighters against targets located in or near Stuttgart, Augsburg, Fürth, and Regensburg. Only 17 bombers failed to return; but a second attack, later in the day, by Fifteenth received a severe mauling. Out of 116 bombers, supported by 96 fighters, the Germans shot down 41 four-engine aircraft. So in a two-day span, American air forces had lost 124 bombers, twice the number lost in the Schweinfurt raid. It was a mark of how greatly American bomber forces had increased over the past months that they could bear such attrition. Overall, during "Big Week," Eighth lost 137 bombers and Fifteenth lost 89, while the two air forces lost only 28 fighters. 133 If Eighth could bear an attrition rate that was close to 20 percent (299 bombers written off) for February, 134 the Germans certainly could not suffer the losses it required to inflict that punishment. In February, Luftwaffe fighter and pilot losses became unmanageable. The tactics that had worked when there was time to attack unescorted bomber formations were no longer effective. American fighters were nearly always present and eager to attack their opponent. As a result, there was little chance to use twin-engine day and night fighters without heavy losses. The experiences of Zerstörergeschwader "Horst Wessel," a Bf 110 fighter squadron, indicates what happened to twin-
