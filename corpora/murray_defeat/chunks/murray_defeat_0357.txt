ere was little chance to use twin-engine day and night fighters without heavy losses. The experiences of Zerst√∂rergeschwader "Horst Wessel," a Bf 110 fighter squadron, indicates what happened to twin-engine fighters in the new combat environment. The unit worked up over January and early February to operational ready status. At 12:13, on February 20, 13 Bf 110's scrambled after approaching bomber formations. Six minutes later, three more aircraft took off to join the first group. When they arrived at a designated contact point, there was nothing left to meet. American fighters had jumped the 13 Bf 110's from the sun and shot down 11. Meanwhile, two enemy fighters strafed the airfield and damaged nine more aircraft. Subsequent operations into March followed the same pattern. On the 22nd, "Horst Wessel" Bf 110's shot down two "Fortresses" but had six aircraft written off and two crews killed. On March 6, from nine aircraft scrambled, two returned with mechanical difficulties, one received damage in air-to-air combat, five were shot 242   ## p. 243 (#263) ############################################  ATTRITION OVER THE REICH down (four pilots wounded and one killed), and the commander landed his damaged aircraft at another airfield." 135 For the Luftwaffe's single-engine force, "Big Week" ushered in a period during which sustained combat devastated its units over the long haul. "Big Week" was only the start of a process that lasted through April and was not the apogee but rather a beginning. Bf 109 and Fw 190 losses were the heaviest thus far in the war for pilots as well as aircraft. The Luftwaffe wrote off over 33 percent of its single- engine fighters and lost 17.9 percent of its fighters pilots during February, 136 Attrition in March was even heavier as Eighth expanded its operations all the way to Berlin. On March 4, American bombers made their first major raid on the German capital and encountered only light opposition. Two days later, they returned to meet a mor
