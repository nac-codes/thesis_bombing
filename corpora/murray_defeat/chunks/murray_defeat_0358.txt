Two days later, they returned to meet a more tenacious opposition, and the bombers lost 69 of their number while 11 escorting fighters were shot down. The third major raid on Berlin within six days occurred on the 8th; and despite excellent visibility, the attacking formations met relatively light opposition. Eighth's losses remained manageable, 37 bombers and 17 escorts. 137 The appearance of American bombers over Berlin tried the imagination of even Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry. One newspaper suggested that: "If the inhabitants of the capital were surprised that, despite the heavy defenses and heavy losses, isolated enemy formations reached the capital in formation, it must be remembered that this need not be interpreted as a sign of strength at all." The VÃ¶lkischer Beobachter, however, won the prize for biased reporting when it claimed that: "If occasionally they fly in clear sky without at the moment being pursued by the dreaded German fighters, only the layman is fooled, and then only for a few moments. . . . In their case, the closed drill formations is not a sign of strength."'138 The attrition of German fighter pilots and aircraft reached a new high point in March. Luftwaffe units wrote off 56.4 percent of single-engine fighters available on March 1, while crew losses reached nearly 22 percent of pilots present on February 29.139 Nevertheless, the Germans did impose severe attrition on Eighth's bombers. Eighth wrote off 349 bombers in March. Not until May did a significant decrease in bomber attrition begin, reflecting the continued arrival of new crews and aircraft as well as the final collapse of the Luftwaffe's fighter force (see Table XLIX140). The rising German losses in March reflected several factors. The most obvious was the tempo of operations. Although bad weather prevented the occurrence of a
