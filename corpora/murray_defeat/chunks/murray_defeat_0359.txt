Although bad weather prevented the occurrence of another "Big Week," Eighth kept up an unremitting pressure on the defenses. The bombing raids forced the Germans to fight and imposed a continuing battle of attrition on their fighters. During the month, the Americans were active over Germany on twenty-three days, thirteen of which involved an all-out effort. 141 Although the bomb damage may not have been as effective as during "Big Week," aerial combat results, including the achievement of air superiority over the continent, were of critical importance.

As an intercepted “Ultra” message on March 8 revealed: The enemy has recognized our own tactics of taking off and getting away from the airfield with all serviceable aircraft before attacks on our ground organization. In the west, he has recently put aside a part of the escorting force to attack these aircraft and has achieved successes in this connection. 143 A message on March 24 indicated how widespread the threat had become.

In doing so, they imitate the landing procedure of German fighters or effect surprise by approaching the airfield in fast and level flight. The difficulty in dist
