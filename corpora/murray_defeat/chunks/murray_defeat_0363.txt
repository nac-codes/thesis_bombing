d scale. Russia attracted most of the attention because of the deteriorating ground situation, while in Italy the Germans managed to stabilize the front north of Naples. Despite the Allied landing at Anzio in January 1944, the Germans held the Allies south of Rome with little support. In addition to the Mediterranean and Russian theaters, the Luftwaffe opened a night offensive against Britain to retaliate for the devastation of the Reich's cities. The diversion of bomber strength from other threaters was considerable, the results meager. The new Chief of Staff, Korten, had supported two strategies upon assuming office: the defense of the Reich and a "strategic" bombing policy on the eastern front. We have catalogued the course of the first strategy; the second element in Korten's policy is worth examining both for its assumptions and its failure. This reorientation in the Luftwaffe's employment began before Jeschonnek's death. In June 1943, Luftflotte 6, controlling aircraft on the central part of the eastern front, proposed a bombing offensive against Russia's armament industries. Its staff, while overestimating prospects for the summer, argued that the Wehrmacht could not achieve a decisive success with "Citadel." The Russians with their immense production would recover and go over to the offensive in winter. To prevent another winter attack, Luftflotte 6 argued that if it possessed sufficient strength, it could successfully attack targets such as the Gorki tank production center. An effective "strategic" bombing offensive, it argued, would injure Russian morale and production to such an extent that the disasters of the previous winters would not recur. 151 Several days later, Jeschonnek himself echoed these points in a conversation with a staff officer. The Chief of Staff suggested that a systematic attack on the armaments factories of the Volga would weaken Russia's ability to launch a "great breakthrough offensive." It would, at least, force Russia's Allies to
