vor of "strategic" bombing. The army with its enormous commitments in the east was loath to lose the air support that the Luftwaffe provided its troops. 154 Conversely, Speer added his prestige to those urging creation of a force to attack Russian industry. On June 23, he formed a committee to look for vulnerable points in the Soviet economy. Because of the limited number of bombers available, the committee urged the use of precision bombing by small groups of aircraft. Like the Air Corps Tactical School theorists of the thirties at Maxwell Field, they selected the electric industry as a choke point. According to Speer, one electric plant on the upper Volga supplied Moscow's power, while the destruction of several powerplants in the Urals would halt much of Russia's steel, tank, and munitions production. 155 Armed with Speer's support, Korten persuaded Hitler and Göring that "strategic" bombing could materially aid the war effort. A November study set forth the arguments. The cover letter admitted that the new approach was a poor man's strategy. It argued that the Luftwaffe's extensive support of ground operations had allowed the Russians to build up their armaments industry undisturbed, and thereby given the Soviets a vast numerical superiority in weapons. Despite an admission that the Red Air Force could defend Russia in depth, the paper optimistically suggested that even with its relatively weak forces, the Luftwaffe could launch precision bombing attacks that would have great impact. There was one premise on which such an offensive rested. The Luftwaffe must withdraw its bomber strength in the east from the close support mission and train it for a "strategic" bombing offensive against Soviet industry. The study itself examined in detail the structure of Soviet armament industries and gave special emphasis to the electric industry as the structure's weak link. 156 These arguments convinced Göring and, for a short time, Hitler. On November 21, the Reichsmarschall
