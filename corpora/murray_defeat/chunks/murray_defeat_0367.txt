drove on Krivoi Roy in the Ukraine and threatened to split the southern front in half. Using forces released from the west, Manstein possessed enough reserves to stem this Russian thrust. The defense of Krivoi Roy was successful not only because of ground reinforcements but because of substantial air support. On this front, the Luftwaffe concentrated all twin-engine bombers in the east along with a substantial proportion of ground attack units. By flying 1,200 sorties per day over a five-day period, the Luftwaffe aided Manstein's forces in halting the Russian offensive. 160 159 The front's stabilization north of Krivoi Roy only brought momentary relief. In the south, a massive Soviet offensive engulfed Sixth Army, captured the city of Melitopol (near the northwest shore of the Sea of Azov), drove straight across to the northwestern shores of the Black Sea, and isolated the Seventeenth Army in the Crimea. Hitler refused requests to withdraw, and the Russians trapped one German division and seven Rumanian divisions. At the beginning of November, Soviet forces broke out from their bridgehead on the western bank of the Dneper near Kiev. The fighting that developed in this region threatened the entire southern front. Manstein's magic could only patch together inadequate solutions to the crises. All the while a terrible attrition of ground forces took place. First Panzer Army warned that its infantry strength had sunk to desperate straits; its divisions under heavy attack were losing a battalion a day. 161 The fall disasters were a prelude to what would happen in the winter. In the south, Russian forces kept the pressure on and forced the Germans back from Kiev and the Dneper almost to the Bug River in the western Ukraine. They also cleared the Germans out of Nikopol in the east central Ukraine and finally captured Krivoi Roy. Hitler's refusal to allow any withdrawals until the last moment enabled the Russians to encircle four divisions near Cherkassy, located 100 miles
