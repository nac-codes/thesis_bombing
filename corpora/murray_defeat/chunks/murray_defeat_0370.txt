In his next 50 missions, he flew only three that lasted more than 10 minutes over enemy territory. For his second 100 missions, 32 lasted longer than 10 minutes, but many of these were weather reconnaissance flights over the Black Sea or supply missions into the Crimea. 167 The Luftwaffe's specialized antitank forces, rushed from one section of the front to another, found it difficult to maintain their operational ready rates and suffered the cumulative effects of constant commitment to combat.

By that time, however, Russian advances in the north had captured the forward operating fields from which the Germans had hoped to launch their air offensive. Gorki now lay entirely outside the range of German aircraft. Finally, hopes for the "strategic" bombing attacks had rested on the idle hope that the He 177 would finally arrive i
