their air offensive. Gorki now lay entirely outside the range of German aircraft. Finally, hopes for the "strategic" bombing attacks had rested on the idle hope that the He 177 would finally arrive in the winter of 1943-44 in substantial numbers to augment the bomber squadrons. It did not, probably luckily for the crews, as Heinkel still had not solved the engine problems. By the time that the first He 177's (outside of the Stalingrad disaster) arrived on the eastern front in the summer of 1944, lack of fuel precluded sustained use of the aircraft. 170 Meanwhile in the west, Hitler's decisions sealed the fate of the "strategic" bombing scheme. For the Nazi leadership, the terrible pounding that Bomber Command was inflicting on Germany's cities had reached intolerable levels. Goebbels sprinkled his diary and speeches with the hope that Germany would soon retaliate. In November 1943, Hitler, believing that his revenge weapons were ready, announced to the assembled Nazi faithful in Munich that, "Our hour of revenge is nigh!. . . . Even if for the present we cannot reach America, thank God that at least one country is close enough to tackle.''17 The unfortunate truth for Hitler, however, was that none of the retaliatory weapons were close to being ready. Both the V-1 and V-2 were encountering difficulties in production, and final tests indicated distressing design problems. Tests of the V-2 carrying its payload for the first time failed completely. Through March 1944, of 57 rockets tested, only 26 got off the ground; of the latter, only 4 reached the target area. The others blew up on re-entry or simply disappeared. 172 Troubles with the rocket program helped turn the Germans to a more conventional means of retaliation: the bomber. The continued emphasis on bomber production and preference for that aircraft type over fighters reflected a human desire to strike back at Germany's tormentors. In October, GÃ¶ring passed on Hitler's demand that the Luftwaffe attack one of th
