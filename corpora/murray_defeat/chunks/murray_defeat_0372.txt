on and preference for that aircraft type over fighters reflected a human desire to strike back at Germany's tormentors. In October, Göring passed on Hitler's demand that the Luftwaffe attack one of the major Italian towns occupied by the British (either Brindisium or Taranto) before the establishment of night fighter defenses. The Führer's purpose was not only to pay back the Italians for their betrayal but also to give neutrals and especially Germany's "rotten" allies an object lesson. 173 In late November, Göring ordered the young bomber expert, Dietrich Peltz, to prepare for a retaliation offensive against London. He promised that units detailed for these attacks would receive a full complement of crews and aircraft. In conclusion, the Reichsmarschall asked Peltz whether he would accept Do 217's in the bombing force; Peltz replied that he would welcome anything that would carry a bomb. 174 That was precisely what he got. Over December and early January, the Germans accumulated a conglomeration of 550 aircraft on the airfields of France for the offensive: Ju 88's, Ju 188's, Do 217's, Me 410's, Fw 200's, and even 35 brand new He 177's. The widely differing capabilities of these aircraft and the limited. navigational and flying skills of the crews lead Peltz to make the attack as simple as 250   ## p. 251 (#271) ############################################  ATTRITION OVER THE REICH possible. Specially trained pathfinders, equipped with various marking devices, would locate and mark the target; the other bombers would hopefully bomb on these markers. 175 Göring opened the offensive on January 21 with a typical gesture. He left Berlin to assume personal command of the operation. He might have saved himself the trouble as the offensive got off to a bad start. The Luftwaffe launched 447 bombers in two waves at the British capital. Navigation was poor, the pathfinder system broke down, and out of 268 tons of bombs dropped over England, only 32 tons landed in London.176 F
