launched 447 bombers in two waves at the British capital. Navigation was poor, the pathfinder system broke down, and out of 268 tons of bombs dropped over England, only 32 tons landed in London.176 For the following four months, the Germans continued attacking with less than spectacular results. The next two attacks were dismal failures; on February 18th, the bombers managed to drop 175 tons within London's confines. Thereafter, the Germans managed to get 50 percent of bomb loads within the target area, but the decreasing size of the force gave better accuracy less significance. 177 The scale of these attacks was miniscule compared to what Bomber Command was doing to German cities. The losses suffered, however, were not infinitesimal. In the "Baby Blitz" attacks, the Germans lost 329 bombers-a loss that was virtually irreplaceable. From 695 operational ready bombers in northern France at the end of December 1943, bomber strength had sunk to 144 by May 1944.178 The Germans could not replace these losses because American attacks on aircraft production had forced them to concentrate their industrial effort on building fighters. While it is arguable whether the bomber forces could have had a significant impact on Russia's armament production, there is no doubt that these bombers would have been a useful addition to German strength when D-day occurred. The other major theater in which the Wehrmacht was locked in combat was the Mediterranean. Here, after a strong response by German fighter bombers to the invasion of Italy and a few solid shots at the Italians bailing out of the war, the Germans withdrew most of their air strength. This move had few repercussions for the troops on the ground. The mountainous nature of Italian geography and the German's skill in defensive warfare allowed the Wehrmacht to wage a protracted campaign. The Germans inflicted heavy casualties on their opponents and tied up considerable Allied resources. Allied efforts in using airpower to strang
