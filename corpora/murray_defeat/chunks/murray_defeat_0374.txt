are allowed the Wehrmacht to wage a protracted campaign. The Germans inflicted heavy casualties on their opponents and tied up considerable Allied resources. Allied efforts in using airpower to strangle the lines of communications caused some difficulty, but the restricted nature of the theater enabled the Germans to evade the full impact of these air interdiction efforts and to maintain a stable defensive system. That very stability minimized the requirements for fuel and other bulk items that would have complicated supply problems. PRODUCTION AND TRAINING This chapter has included a general discussion of major production issues along with operational matters. There are, however, several aspects of the production program best left to this last section. Milch's continued efforts to increase efficiency throughout the aircraft industry was generally successful. However, for the first time in the war, Allied bombing seriously hurt aircraft and particularly fighter production. Milch had by now recognized the desperate need for more 251   ## p. 252 (#272) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT fighters to meet the American threat. The choice was either to meet the daylight offensive with enough fighters or lose air superiority over the European continent. Neither Hitler and GÃ¶ring nor more sober military men like Korten were willing to recognize that they faced an either/or situation. Thus, emphasis remained on a bomber/fighter program until late winter 1944. By then, it was too late; while the aircraft industry under Speer's direction drove up fighter production, no coherent program existed to provide the pilots or fuel that they would require. The point of no return had come by the early fall of 1943; thereafter, it was too late. One element of German aircraft production and development that has consistently appeared in historical discussions is the development of the Me 262. That fighter was a design and engineering marvel for its time. Howe
