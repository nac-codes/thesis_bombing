ery month that passes makes it more and more probable that we will get at least one squadron of jet aircraft: The more important thing is that they [the enemy] get some bombs on top of them just as they try to invade. That will force them to take cover . . . and in this way they will waste hour after hour! But after half a day our reserves will already be on the way. 183 The real explosion did not come until the end of May when Hitler discovered that the Luftwaffe was manufacturing the Me 262 as a fighter that could not carry bombs. He drastically intervened and ordered major design changes in the aircraft. 184 It is doubtful, however, whether this decision had much impact on the war's final outcome. The engineers had only worked the flaws out of the production 252   ## p. 253 (#273) ############################################  ATTRITION OVER THE REICH line by March with the first models appearing in that month. Output for April was 16 Me 262's, rising to 28 in June, and 59 in July. 185 Even under the best of circumstances, it is unlikely that a massive output of Me 262's could have occurred in 1944. By the time its production began, Allied escorts had already savaged the German fighter forces, and the Germans had irrevocably lost air superiority over the continent. The losses in experienced pilots during the spring make it especially doubtful whether the Luftwaffe could have manned an Me 262 force with effective, skilled crews. American bombing attacks on German aircraft production had begun in the summer of 1943. The target selection represented a direct threat to the Luftwaffe's production base and faced the Germans with a serious dilemma. The most effective use of resources and manpower to produce aircraft calls for a concentration of industrial effort to mass produce the items. The Ford Willow Run plant and the many other great industrial plants then operating in the United States underline this point. Milch, from early 1942, had pushed the German aircraft ind
