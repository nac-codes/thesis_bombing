hat German production rose only 23.9 percent in terms of airframe weight. 189 Unhindered by Allied bombing, German production would have risen far higher and far faster. The target of 80,000-plus aircraft in production plans for 1945 gives an indication of the direction in which Milch and his planners were pushing. 190 When all is said and done, however, the German achievement in increasing fighter production in 1944 was remarkable. "Big Week" had proven that the Americans aimed at nothing less than the destruction of Germany's aircraft 253   ## p. 254 (#274) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT industry. The German response was to create a special group, the "Fighter Staff,‚Äù to take control of all aircraft manufacturing in order to maintain and to increase production. The proposal for such a group came from Milch, and the Field Marshal's suggestion that Speer's assistant, Karl-Otto Sauer, head the staff, shrewdly insured that fighter production received maximum support from the Armaments Ministry. Under the battering of American bombers, the aircraft industry was in dangerous shape. Bombing attacks had obliterated factories, machines, roofs, and walls. Moreover, morale had sunk to such low levels that workers scurried for shelter at the mere appearance of fighters. 191 Also, the attacks had destroyed much finished production still awaiting shipment to the front. 192 The "Fighter Staff" began a desperate struggle to bring order in the wake of American raids. A circular from Speer's ministry warned that the fighter defenses were the only means to protect the armament industry from Allied air attacks. 193 Frontline pilots called desperately for replacements for those aircraft that American escorts were so rapidly shooting out of the air. Galland, reporting that he had had only 250 fighters the day before to meet the American onslaught, pleaded for "fighters, fighters, nothing but fighters" from industrialists and managers. 194 The "Fighter
