f the fighter force was the fact that flying hours in schools for German pilots were less than half of what British and American pilots received. Production shortages meant that German pilots received their training almost entirely in obsolete aircraft. Ironically, the massive production program of spring 1944 finally solved that problem in late summer. However, by that time there was no fuel left for training. The result of these training weaknesses and the attrition taking place in early 1944 was that the experience and the skill level of German fighter pilots spiraled 254   ## p. 255 (#275) ############################################  ATTRITION OVER THE REICH downward. In July 1944, Luftflotte 3 discovered that with few exceptions, only Gruppen and Staffelen commanders had more than six months' operational fighter experience. A small number of other pilots had up to three months' experience, while the bulk of available pilots had only between eight and thirty days' combat service. 199 All of these factors by 1944 had become mutually reinforcing. The declining skill of German fighter pilots pushed up the level of attrition taking place, which increased the demand that the training establishment turn out more pilots. The viciousness of the circle received its final impetus and the Luftwaffe its death blow when the May attacks on German petroleum sources robbed the training program of the fuel needed to produce new pilots. CONCLUSION All of the factors that had worked against the Luftwaffe in the early periods of the war and that had slowly worn away its strength came together to destroy it as an effective force in the period from September 1943 through March 1944. By refusing to recognize the full nature of the threat, the Germans placed their air force in a hopeless situation. The Luftwaffe did manage to make a remarkable recovery in its ability to defend Germany from night attack, but that tactical victory did little to change the war's course. However, despite
