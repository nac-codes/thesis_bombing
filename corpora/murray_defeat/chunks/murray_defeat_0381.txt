situation. The Luftwaffe did manage to make a remarkable recovery in its ability to defend Germany from night attack, but that tactical victory did little to change the war's course. However, despite such tactical victories, the steady, wearing, and growing pressure of the daytime American bomber and fighter offensive destroyed the German fighter force. There were no decisive moments or clear-cut victories. Rather, the American pressure put the German fighters in a meat grinder battle of attrition both in terms of pilots and of materiel. It was the cumulative effect of that intense pressure that in the final analysis enabled the Western Powers to gain air superiority over Europe; that achievement must be counted among the decisive victories of World War II. 255   ## p. 256 (#276) ############################################  Notes 1.
