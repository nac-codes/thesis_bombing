pport of "Overlord," a course of action that he regarded with considerable distaste, were several. On one hand, his command had suffered terrible losses during the winter, and he seems to have been more amenable to Air Staff direction in the spring. The second factor pushing Harris towards compliance was an excellent political sense-he undoubtedly realized that "Overlord" represented a venture that either he supported or he risked losing his position. The final element pushing Bomber Command towards support for the invasion was the fact that Harris' argument that his bombers could not attack precision targets in France was incorrect. The initial invasion plan had envisioned an extensive campaign against the transportation system of northern France, with the main target being railroad marshalling yards. The claims that Bomber Command was suitable only for "area" bombing had alarmed Churchill. If Harris were correct, those French living near the target areas were in great danger. As a result, in March, British bombers carried out test raids on six French towns. Using Oboe and new marking techniques, the raids succeeded beyond anyone's expectations." An attack on Vaires not only destroyed the railroad yards but occurred while troop trains of the Waffen SS division "Frundsberg" lay on sidings intermingled with several carloads of mines. The Germans collected nearly 1,200 identity disks from the Waffen SS dead." French casualties were minimal. Establishment of a command system to control air assets in support of the invasion was a tortuous process. In 1943, Air Marshal Sir Trefford Leigh-Mallory received appointment as Commander, Allied Expeditionary Air Force. However, neither Spaatz nor Harris wished to subordinate their "strategic" bombers to a man possessing experience only with "tactical" aircraft. Eisenhower then appointed Tedder as his chief deputy, and Churchill's suggestion that the latter command all air assets in Britain might have removed some ambiguities in
