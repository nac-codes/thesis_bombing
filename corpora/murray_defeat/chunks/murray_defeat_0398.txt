Eisenhower then appointed Tedder as his chief deputy, and Churchill's suggestion that the latter command all air assets in Britain might have removed some ambiguities in command relationships. As the official historians note: Had Churchill's suggestion been adopted, "orders and not ambassadors could have been sent to the strategic air forces." Churchill's proposal met strong resistance and an eventual compromise gave Tedder limited control over the bomber commands. He was to form the air plan in consultation with Harris and Spaatz, while Leigh-Mallory under Tedder's guidance would draw up the "tactical" air plans for "Overlord." Then Portal and Eisenhower, acting through the Chiefs of Staff, would see that the heavy bomber 265   ## p. 266 (#286) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT 8 assets required to support the invasion would be available. The command arrangements took a period of time to settle down and, although somewhat clumsy, the good sense of Allied commanders made them function. Two considerable arguments occurred in the months before the invasion. The first was Churchill's continuing worry that tens of thousands of Frenchmen would die in attacks on the transportation system. Such casualties would have serious implications for future Anglo-French relations. While extensive arguments took place between Churchill and those favoring a bombing campaign against transportation targets, Bomber Command's accurate and precise destruction of French rail yards eventually alleviated the Prime Minister's doubts." The second argument was between advocates of the transportation plan and Spaatz's adherence to "Pointblank" objectives. The American commander, however, interjected a new element into the "strategic" bombing offensive by pushing Germany's oil industry to the top of his priority list. The tendency among some historians to see a clear delineation between the oil and transportation plans distorts what act
