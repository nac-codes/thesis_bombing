. The intelligence officer who handled "Ultra" messages at Eighth Air Force headquarters later claimed that intercepts, indicating that shortages were general and not local, convinced â€œall concerned that the air offensive had uncovered a weak spot in the German economy and led to exploitation of this weakness to the fullest extent."'42 The first intercept, underlining German vulnerability, came almost immediately. On May 16, Bletchly Park forwarded a May 14 message cancelling a general staff order that Luftflotten 1 and 6 surrender to Luftflotte 3 five heavy and four light or medium flak batteries each. These battteries were to be reassigned to Luftflotte Reich to protect the hydrogenation plant at Troglitz. In addition, four heavy flak batteries from Oschersleben, four from Wiener-Neustadt, and two from Leipzig-Erla (defending aircraft production plants) were to move to other synthetic fuel plants.43 On the 21st, another intercept from an unspecified source ordered that: Consumption of mineral oil in every form... be substantially reduced. . . in view of effects of Allied action in Rumania and on German hydrogenation plants; extensive failures in mineral oil production and a considerable reduction in the June allocation of fuel oil, etc., were to be expected. 44 After feverish efforts to repair damage, production had almost returned to preattack levels by the end of the month.45 On May 28, Eighth Air Force struck again with only half the force used in the first attack. Supported by fighters, 400- plus bombers attacked the synthetic fuel plants. Again fighter opposition was heavy, and 32 bombers were lost (nearly 10 percent of the force). On the next day, Eighth again attacked the fuel plants, while Fifteenth Air Force hit aircraft factories in Austria. Bomber losses were 52, making a total of 84 heavy bombers lost in two days. Attrition of German pilots was also severe. On May 28, day fighter squadrons 273   ## p. 274 (#294) ########################################
