Should the Führer not provide defensive support for oil production centers, the enemy would soon recognize recovery efforts and destroy the repair work.52 Speer alluded directly to the fact that Hitler had promised in May to hold the fighter force in Germany to defend synthetic fuel plants. However, he had then turned around in June and thrown it against the invasion where Allied fighters could destroy it.53 Speer pointed out to Hitler in July that the number of day fighters available in the Reich to defend synthetic plants was substantially under what had been present in early June (see Table LIX54).

If Hitler refused to protect the fuel plants, Speer warned, there would not be adequate fuel for the Luftwaffe.55 By mid-summer, as fighter production reached its wartime high, the Germans were approaching the situation where the hundreds of aircraft their industry turned out had neither fuel to fly nor pilots. Pilot training schools were already shutting down for lack of fuel. The circumstances recall a somewhat ironic remark that Göring made in early 1943: 275   ## p. 276 (#296) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT ... furthermore I am of the opinion that the building of our aircraft should not depend in any way on the fuel programme. I would rather have a mass of aircraft standing around unable to fly owing to a lack of petrol
