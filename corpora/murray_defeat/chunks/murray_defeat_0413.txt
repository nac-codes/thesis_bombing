tary leadership that had placed him again in a hopeless situation. Conversely, Spaatz's oil attacks achieved two major goals. First, it continued the decimation of the Luftwaffe and it hindered the training program from regenerating pilot strength. Second, it robbed the Wehrmacht of its motorized mobility. The conduct of these operations raises an interesting point concerning the personalities and capabilities of Tedder and Spaatz.
