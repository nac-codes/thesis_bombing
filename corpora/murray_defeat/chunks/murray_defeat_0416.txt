ious disadvantage by greater enthusiasm and courage."64 Extension of American fighter range throughout the Reich gave the Germans an additional headache. Training flights, both beginning and advanced, now frequently came under attack from American fighters. 65 66 A conference between Galland and Göring in mid-May underlined how enemy air operations were devastating the fighter force. Galland reported that Luftflotte Reich had lost 38 percent of its fighter pilots in April, while Luftflotte 3 had lost 24 percent of its fighter pilot strength. Altogether, the Germans had lost 489 pilots (100 of whom were officers), Galland reported, while training centers had forwarded only 396 new pilots (including 62 officers). Galland's proposals to meet the shortfall and continued attrition reflected the desperate situation. He urged (1) that all fighter pilots holding short staff positions be transferred immediately to operational units, (2) that qualified night fighter pilots transfer to the day fighter force, (3) that two fighter Gruppen transfer from the eastern front as soon as possible, and (4) that the ground attack command release all pilots with more than five victories to the defense of the Reich. Finally, Galland reported that flying schools had released 80-plus instructors to fill empty cockpits.67 Other evidence suggests a rush to strip commands outside of Luftflotte Reich of experienced pilots in order to reconstitute defense forces at the center. Fliegerkorps I on the eastern front was ordered to surrender 15 pilots, "including 2 to 4 aces," after it had received a new draft of pilots straight from training school.68 Galland even suggested that all fighter Gruppen in France pull back to Germany to meet the bomber threat. Göring, fearing that an invasion was imminent, refused. 69 As had happened over the past year and a half, the Luftwaffe used Russia as a school for inexperienced pilots. There they could build flying and fighting skills before being thrown into the
