fused. 69 As had happened over the past year and a half, the Luftwaffe used Russia as a school for inexperienced pilots. There they could build flying and fighting skills before being thrown into the cauldron of western air battles. 70 However, there was less chance to do this now, because there were fewer squadrons in the east and because attrition was so high in the skies over Germany that the Luftwaffe had to throw new pilots directly into combat against Allied air forces. The following two cases show what the scale of combat losses meant to individual fighter Gruppen. The III Gruppe/JG 53 possessed an average strength of 23 aircraft in April with 16 serviceable. During the month, the Gruppe lost nine aircraft in combat with one slightly damaged. Six more were written off due to noncombat causes with one aircraft badly damaged and three slightly damaged. The Gruppe suffered five pilots killed and two injured (average crew strength would have approximated the number of aircraft). In the month, its aircraft took part in 38 separate operations on twenty-four days with 431 combat sorties." The tempo of air operations in May showed in the following report of II Gruppe/JG 53: 278   ## p. 279 (#299) ############################################  DEFEAT (A) Operations took place on thirteen days.
