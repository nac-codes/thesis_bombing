r the English Channel and invasion beaches. The scale of these attacks forced the Germans to abandon efforts to prepare bases close to the Channel and to select airfields far to the southeast.77 Thus, on the brink of the invasion, the Luftwaffe had lost control of its base structure in France. Since December 1943, the Germans had planned to move major aircraft reinforcements into Luftflotte 3 when the invasion occurred. That command would then launch a decisive air attack against the landings.78 Further plans followed in February. Basic premises were that "defense against an invasion [would] be decisive for the successful conclusion to the war" and that "massed intervention of all the flying units in the first hours of a landing would be decisive for the continuation of the whole undertaking."79 Such platitudes sounded impressive. However, by June, the Allied air offensive had removed all possibility for the Germans to make an effective aerial response. Air battles in Germany had devastated the Reich's fighter forces, German bombing attacks on Britain had 279   ## p. 280 (#300) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT eliminated most of the bombers, and Allied attacks on forward operating airfields had destroyed much of the base support. What is remarkable in examining Luftflotte 3's force structure is the fact that it contained few ground support aircraft, as nearly all ground support squadrons were on the eastern front (with 550 aircraft) in anticipation of what the Germans correctly believed would be a major Russian offensive. 80 As a result, fighter aircraft would have to fly most of the attacks on the invasion forces. These fighters would fly in from Luftflotte Reich, and their pilots would have received no previous training in fighter bomber tactics. The weight of their bomb loads would put German pilots at an even greater disadvantage against Allied fighters. 81 On June 5, 1944, Luftflotte 3 contained 815 aircraft, of which approximat
