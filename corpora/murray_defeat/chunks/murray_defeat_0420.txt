The weight of their bomb loads would put German pilots at an even greater disadvantage against Allied fighters. 81 On June 5, 1944, Luftflotte 3 contained 815 aircraft, of which approximately 600 were in commission. 82 The hope was that fighter forces from Luftflotte Reich would build up aerial forces in France to required levels.

They lost only 127 aircraft. By the end of the first day, the British had landed 75,215 troops and the Americans 57,500. In addition, some 23,000 airborne troops had dropped behind the invasion beaches. 84 Throughout the day, the Luftwaffe was hardly seen. But Field Marshal Sperrle did issue a pompous order of the day to his troops: Men of Luftflotte 3! The enemy has launched the long-announced invasion.
