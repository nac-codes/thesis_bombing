h Germany, the attacks on Nuremburg, Munich, and Augsburg made the population restive, angry, and bitter. The SD (Sicherheitsdienst, Secret Police) reports on what the population was saying (reports widely read in the highest levels of Nazi leadership) noted that people no longer exchanged the Nazi salute, reviled the party as the author of their trouble, regarded Goebbels as an outright liar and cheat, wore party badges less and less, and were depressed and embittered at the course of the war. The population singled out the Luftwaffe particularly for their reproaches, and as early as the â€œLancaster" attack on the MAN works in Augsburg in April 1942 wondered why such an important location had not received sufficient protection.

Initially, the constant repetitive theme in Nazi propaganda that Germany would never suffer another November 1918 reflected real worries, reinforced by the SD reports, in the highest levels of government concerning the impact of bombing on popular support and morale. These reports help explain why the regime was unwilling to embark on a scheme of "total" mobilization of the Reich's economic and human resources until after the July 20, 1944, attempt on Hitler's life.

There is another aspect of popular reaction that also had serious impact on the leadership in 1943. In one of those quirks of human nature, at the same time that the Germans were depressed and gloomy over the bombing, they were also extraordinarily angry at their
