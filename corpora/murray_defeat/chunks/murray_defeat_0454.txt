us impact on the leadership in 1943. In one of those quirks of human nature, at the same time that the Germans were depressed and gloomy over the bombing, they were also extraordinarily angry at their tormentors and were demanding retaliation against Britain for the damage inflicted on their homes. The SD reports, reflecting the popular mood, explain the leadership's demand for retaliation weapons (the V-1 and V-2), its willingness to waste the Luftwaffe's bomber fleet over the winter of 1944 even though faced by the threat of an Allied invasion, and its refusal to provide the necessary support needed to the fighter forces until military defeat was obvious and inescapable. Moreover, the distortion in military production as a result 300   ## p. 301 (#321) ############################################  CONCLUSION of demands for the V-1 and V-2 retaliation weapons was enormous. The strategic bombing survey estimates that the industrial effort and resources expended for these weapons in the last year and a half of the war alone equalled the production of 24,000 fighter aircraft.³ Here the regime was reacting to popular pressures, and the resulting decisions responded to political factors rather than to strategic and military realities. Thus, just in terms of the retaliatory weapons policy, the distortion that the bombing achieved in the German war effort was of real consequence to the war's outcome. The American daylight bombing campaign reinforced these trends. Throughout the last half of 1943, Göring bitterly reproached his fighter pilots despite their efforts and sacrifices. His comments that the German people could not understand how American bomber formations flew untouched over the Reich shows that the Reichsmarschall was reading the SD reports as well as receiving bitter comments from Hitler and other Nazi leaders. References drawn from popular disquiet over the daylight bombing sprinkled Göring's speeches to his generals as well as pilots.* But the contribution o
