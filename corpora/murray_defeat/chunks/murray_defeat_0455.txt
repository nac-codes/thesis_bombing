ter comments from Hitler and other Nazi leaders. References drawn from popular disquiet over the daylight bombing sprinkled GÃ¶ring's speeches to his generals as well as pilots.* But the contribution of the American air forces to the war effort was more direct in 1943 and 1944 than Bomber Command's skewing of Germany's production efforts. From late spring 1943, American "strategic" bombing attacks against German industry imposed a wasting attrition on the Luftwaffe's fighter forces. The severe fighting over the Reich in the summer and fall coupled with decimation of air units fighting on the periphery placed a rising and, in the long run, intolerable burden on the Luftwaffe. Moreover, production of new fighters fell off substantially due to American bombing. Nevertheless, American air commanders were forced to suspend daylight, unescorted bombing missions in October. The respite was short indeed. In February 1944, the American bombing forces returned to the Reich, this time accompanied by fighter support. In the air battles that followed, American air forces broke the back of the Luftwaffe and assured complete Allied air superiority over the continent for the invasion. The achievement of that air superiority allowed the Allies to launch a true "strategic" bombing effort in which the air effort was closely integrated into overall strategy. Bomber Command's specialized marking capabilities and navigational aids allowed it to destroy marshalling yards throughout northern France, while Eighth Air Force and the Allied Tactical Air Force contributed to a creeping transportation paralysis throughout western Europe. German movement was substantially hindered, and the transportation of reserves to the battlefront in Normandy became most difficult. Meanwhile, Eighth's attacks on oil production insured that the immobility of the rail system spread to motorized movement as well. They also ended permanently what small chance the Luftwaffe had for a comeback. Thus, the efforts of
