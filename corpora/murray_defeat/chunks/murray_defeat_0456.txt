Thus, the efforts of the Allied air forces, "strategic" and "tactical," played a critical role in the winning of World War II. Airpower had shown that it worked to greatest effect when its strategy was integrated and was connected with efforts on the ground and at sea; and that while airpower had not changed the rules of the game, it had become a critically important element in the overall equation. 301   ## p. 302 (#322) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HILL One can argue with justification that the Germans lost World War II in the late summer of 1940 and that their future defeats on the ground and in the air sprang from their unwillingness at that time to identify and to face the real strategic situation.
