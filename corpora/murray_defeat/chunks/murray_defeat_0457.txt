ain. Not until the Wehrmacht was deep in the Soviet Union did Göring finally authorize Milch to bring order to the aircraft industry. By that time, it was too late. British production programs had a two-year head start, while the American programs were at least a year ahead. If that handicap were not enough, Milch faced a constant, uphill battle to persuade the general staff to accept as a necessity the production increases that he proposed. That failure to gear German aircraft production to a worst case analysis of what Anglo-American industry might turn out cost the Luftwaffe the air war in 1943 and 1944. One cannot stress enough that administrative, strategic, and productive decisions in the 1940 to 1941 time frame insured the permanent inferiority of Germany's air effort throughout the remainder of the war. The basis of those decisions lay in an overestimation of the Reich's strength and a contemptuous arrogance that dismissed the Russians as subhumans and the Americans as capable of building only radios and refrigerators. Disdainful of their enemies and proud of their victories, the Germans were sure that their technological expertise and military competence could master any threat. In addition to production and mobilization issues is the question of attrition. There is an irony here, for airpower thinkers before the war, like the ground theorists, were sure that their doctrine would provide a means to return to the era of quick, cheap wars. According to them, aircraft would enable the nations equipped with air fleets to escape the killing of Paschendael, the Somme, and Verdun. The terrible reality was that war in the air was even deadlier for those who flew from 1939 to 1945 than the war in the trenches. Martin Middlebrook in his book, The Nuremberg Raid, presents the survival prospects for aircrews who served in Bomber Command long enough to have a chance of completing a tour on operations (see Table LXI³). 302   ## p. 303 (#323) #############################
