the survival prospects for aircrews who served in Bomber Command long enough to have a chance of completing a tour on operations (see Table LXIÂ³). 302   ## p. 303 (#323) ############################################  CONCLUSION TABLE LXI Aircrew Survival Rate, Bomber Command-1939-1945 Killed on Operations Killed in Crashes in England Seriously Injured in Crashes Prisoners of War (Some Injured) Percent 51 9 3 12 1 Shot Down But Evaded Capture Survived Unharmed 24 German pilots had no such thing as a tour on operations. For fighters, the attrition of German pilots over the war was probably well into the 90th percentile. The statistic mentioned in the last chapter on the average length of service of line pilots (between eight and thirty days) is an indication of the fate awaiting those who flew fighters for the Luftwaffe. The statistics for bomber, night fighter, or "Stuka" pilots could not have been much better. The statistics available on the Luftwaffe point out in unambiguous terms precisely how attrition affected its force structure and capabilities (see Tables LXII," LXIII,' and LXIV). Through the first two years of the war (1940-41), the loss rates for aircraft had been alarming, even though the Germans had for the most part enjoyed qualitative superiority over their opponents. Thereafter, however, the impact of swelling enemy production and the commitment of the Wehrmacht to hold the distant perimeter of the expanded Reich steadily increased the attrition rate. Increases in German aircraft production, no matter how impressive graphically, were ineffective since, in relation to Allied industrial efforts, the Germans were falling further and further behind. In fact, the impact of the air war on the German force structure was such that rising attrition cancelled out increasing production so that there was remarkably little change in the Luftwaffe's total frontline strength from 1940 through 1944, particularly in the combat categories of fighter and bomber aircraft
