creasing production so that there was remarkably little change in the Luftwaffe's total frontline strength from 1940 through 1944, particularly in the combat categories of fighter and bomber aircraft (see Tables LXV9 and LXVI¹º). A comparison of the figures for May 1940 and January 1944 are most instructive; at the start of the French campaign, the Luftwaffe possessed 1,369 fighters and 1,758 bombers; over three and one-half years later, the Germans possessed only 1,561 fighters and 1,604 bombers (see Tables LXV and LXVI). In fact, the loss rate was such that increasing German production was never able to sustain frontline squadrons at their full authorized strength (see Table LXVII"). While there were, of course, fluctuations in the percentages of authorized strength on hand in frontline units, the trend from 1942 on was unmistakenly downwards. The loss of aircraft was only one indicator among many as to what was happening to the Luftwaffe. The attrition of pilots and skilled aircrews was perhaps the most important factor in the destruction of the Luftwaffe as an effective fighting force. The rise in the attrition rate for pilots resulted in a steady reduction in the skills and experience of those flying German aircraft. While the losses among the fighter pilots (see Table LXVIII2) may have been somewhat heavier than for other categories, they undoubtedly reflected what was happening throughout the force. structure. The increasing attrition of pilots forced the Germans to curtail training 303   ## p. 304 (#324) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT TABLE LXII GERMAN AIRCRAFT LOSSES 6 MO.
