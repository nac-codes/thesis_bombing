et Union by conquering the Caucasus and large portions of southern Russia. The resources available for such wide-ranging aims were completely inadequate. To offset weakness on the ground, the German high command threw the Luftwaffe onto the scale. As a result, attrition of air units in support of offensive operations was extensive. These losses were avoidable in the sense that had the Germans chosen a more realistic strategy that was more consistent with their capabilities, they could have husbanded their strength for a confrontation with Anglo-American and Russian military power in the following years. They did not do so and, as had happened in 1941, the Luftwaffe found its frontline squadrons exhausted. This occurred despite Milch's substantive improvements in industrial methods and procedures, and a rapid increase in aircraft production over the low rates for 1940 and 1941. The second factor that was different in 1942 than in 1941 was the fact that both the Soviet Union and the Western Powers were able to reap the first benefits of their industrial mobilizations.

Unwilling to recognize how much the balance had swung against Germany, Hitler, supported by the OKW, responded to that challenge. The attrition that resulted was what one might term a "response" attrition. The Germans, reacting to moves in the Mediterranean, determined to stand and fight despite the disadvantage of vulnerable lines of communications from Sicily to Tunisia. At the same time, the Russians launched their counterattack at Stalingrad. Responding to a strategic move by his Soviet opponent, Hitler ordered Sixth Army to stand and fight along the Volga. Here again, the attrition
