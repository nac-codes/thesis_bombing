the Russians launched their counterattack at Stalingrad. Responding to a strategic move by his Soviet opponent, Hitler ordered Sixth Army to stand and fight along the Volga. Here again, the attrition was a "response" attrition, losses that the Germans could have avoided had they traded space for time. The resulting erosion in the Mediterranean and on the Russian front pushed the Luftwaffe's loss rates for the end of 1942 and the first half of 1943 towards a level of 20 percent per month. Meanwhile, a new danger appeared. In the west, British night raids had become an increasing threat to the safety of Germany's cities; and in the spring of 1943, the appearance of American daylight formations over the Reich represented a direct threat to the Luftwaffe and its sources of supply the aircraft industry. Without new aircraft, the Luftwaffe could not meet its growing responsibilities and the increasing losses at the front. Unlike 1941 and 1942 when the Luftwaffe could fight on its own terms, it now had to meet the American bombers. The attrition that took place over the Reich, we might call "imposed" attrition, for Eighth Air Force forced the Luftwaffe to fight. However, as the Americans discovered, attrition is a two-way street. Even with the successes of American industrial and training programs, no organization can sustain a constant monthly attrition of 30 percent in manpower without consequences. The second raid on Schweinfurt produced so many aircraft and crew losses that Americans had to rethink their operational and tactical approach. The Luftwaffe losses in the summer and early fall likewise forced the Germans to rethink their strategy. The threat to the armament industries, particularly the aircraft industry, and the extent of losses in the Mediterranean, on the eastern front, and over the Reich, gave the Germans no choice but to reorder their priorities. They had to cut air commitments in the Mediterranean and in the east to provide more fighters for defense of
