tern front, and over the Reich, gave the Germans no choice but to reorder their priorities. They had to cut air commitments in the Mediterranean and in the east to provide more fighters for defense of the homeland. But Hitler was unwilling in 1943 to reorder his production priorities completely and to give unqualified emphasis to building fighters. This undoubtedly made the task of the American strategic air forces easier when the Eighth returned to the offensive. The great air battle was not a painless struggle as bomber losses through April 1944 indicate. But the combination of long-range escorts, with an overwhelming productive advantage, enabled Eighth to swamp Germany's defenders. The Americans, with their sustained pressure, shattered the Luftwaffe's fighter force to the point where they were no longer a serious factor in the air war. By the time of the Normandy invasion, the Americans had won general air superiority over Europe, while attacks on the synthetic fuel industry insured that the Luftwaffe would not recover. Not only did it no longer have 317   ## p. 318 (#338) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT the necessary fuel but there was no hope to train new pilots in the numbers needed to meet the daylight threat. The Luftwaffe attrition rate over the last three years of the war was extraordinarily high. Its impact on the German air force only began to become apparent in the summer of 1943 when it was arguably too late for the Germans to reverse trends that put them at an increasing disadvantage. There was some slight hope that a massive influx of resources might redress the balance between the fighter force and the enemy's growing air superiority. But even at this desperate moment, the Reich's leaders were unwilling to support such a program. The warning signs had been apparent earlier. The Americans especially had made no secret of their production plans. As the Germans fell behind in the production race, their losses mounted
