factors. The most important of these was the outstanding quality of middle-level leadership. The explanation for how squadron and flight commanders kept their organizations together lay in a rigid refusal by the Germans to lower the standards in the officers corps. "Better no officer than a bad officer' might be a characterization of how the Germans viewed recruiting for the officer corps. There was one additional element in the Germans' ability to continue the flight. Like the army, the Luftwaffe until almost the end prized unit cohesion.

To the end, they waged that struggle with operational and
