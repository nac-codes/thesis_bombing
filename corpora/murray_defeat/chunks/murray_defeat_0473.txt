ht detract from the support that the Royal Flying Corps provided Haig's plodding offensive in Flanders. "Boom" Trenchard, the first Chief of Staff, argued strenuously against standing air patrols to defend London (the only possible means of air defense in 1917) and opposed the transfer of fighter units from France to defend Great Britain.' Trenchard's first tenure as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) proved less than auspicious, and in 1918 the Cabinet moved him to a relatively less important position. He assumed command of the independent bomber force in France that showed, whatever its promise, little performance in the remaining months of war.2 The last years of the war saw a crystallization of certain patterns in strategic thinking that would dominate the Royal Air Force throughout the interwar period. The political response to the Zeppelin raids had been, in many cases, to see air warfare in apocalyptic terms.3 However, Trenchard, soon to be closely identified with the concept of "strategic" bombing, was dubious at first about the 321   ## p. 322 (#342) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT 4 establishment of a bombing force to attack targets within Germany. His attitude mostly reflected a deep sympathy for Haig and a desire to concentrate maximum forces in support of the western front.

Establishment of the Royal Air Force as an independent service reinforced this tendency to accentuate the importan
