ny by an Allied strategic striking force should be formulated without delay." The launching of attacks by the pooled resources of Allied air forces would force the Germans to divert significant resources from the western front to home defense and to exacerbate further Germany's strategic difficulties. In conclusion, they noted: that the alternative to such diversion would be that the German government would be forced to face very considerable and constantly increasing civil pressure which might result in political disintegration.
