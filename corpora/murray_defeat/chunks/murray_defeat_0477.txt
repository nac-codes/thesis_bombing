Army and navy leaders may well have persisted in demands for the return of such aircraft precisely to remove one of the hungry mouths at the treasury's increasingly spare dinner table. 323   ## p. 324 (#344) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT The RAF was saved from a quick death at the end of World War I when Lloyd George had entertained the idea of ending the independence of the air service. The choice of Churchill to hold both the War Office and the Air Ministry did not appear fortuitous in December 1918; however, not only did Churchill defend the new service but he also was instrumental in bringing Trenchard back as Chief of Staff. 14 And Trenchard, through the sheer force of his personality as well as his skillful political maneuvering, insured the continued existence of the fledgling service. Among other devices, Trenchard expanded the emerging trends in strategic thinking that were present in the Royal Air Force at the end of the war into a full-fledged doctrine of "strategic" bombing. Outside influences seem to have played almost no role in this development. Harris claims never to have heard of Douhet before the war, while Slessor admits in his memoirs that not only had he never read Douhet but had never even heard of him before the war. 15 Trenchard's doctrine postulated that airpower alone could defend Britain and that its massive striking power could destroy England's enemies at the onset of war.
