as from the beginning of the war, with the objective of obtaining a decision by moral[e] effect which such attacks will produce, and by the serious dislocation of the normal life of the country, or, alternatively, they can be used in the first instance to attack enemy aerodromes with a view to gaining some measure of air superiority and, when this has been gained, can be changed over to the direct attack on the nation. The latter alternative is the method which the lessons of military history seem to recommend, but the Air Staff are convinced that the former is the correct one. For the conduct of the air offensive against an enemy power (the belligerent countries, not named, would be "separated by 20 or 30 miles of sea"), the Air Staff suggested that fighters would play almost no role. The distances involved would make it impossible to build a fighter that would have sufficient range and efficiency. Thus, the Air Staff could state "as a principle that the bombing squadrons should be as numerous as possible and the fighters as few as popular opinion and the necessity for defending vital objectives will permit.'''7 In May 1928, Trenchard further elaborated for the benefit of his fellow chiefs of Staff the view expressed in the above memorandum that air forces could alter "the lessons of military history." The CAS claimed that it would not be necessary for an air force, as with the other services, to defeat the enemy's armed forces in order to defeat his nation. "Airpower can dispense with that immediate step. . . ." While Trenchard admitted that it would be wrong and "contrary to the dictates of humanity" to conduct "indiscriminate bombing of a city for the sole pupose of terrorizing the civilian population," he argued that it was an entirely different matter "to terrorize munition workers (men and women) into absenting themselves from work or stevedores into abandoning the loading of a ship with munitions through fear of attack. . . ."'18 If Trenchard can be accused
