Moreover, he identified and supported such strong personalities as Dowding, Tedder, Portal, and Slessor, among others. They and their service would be Trenchard's contribution towards the winning of the Second World War. One should also note that throughout the 1920's when Trenchard and the Air Staff were creating their doctrine of "strategic" bombing, RAF officers serving in the world of colonial pacification, police actions, and border skirmishes were actively engaged in air operations that had little to do with "strategic" bombing.

He argued that the coming war would be nearly all air combat and that Britain could only gain and maintain air superiority through a "resolute bombing offensive" against enemy cities and industries.
