on of the parameters involved in the coming air war in terms of weapons or tactics. There was considerable difficulty in estimating capabilities with so little prior experience. In 1938, the Joint Planning Committee conceded: In considering air attack, we are faced with the difficulty that we lack the guidance of past experience in almost all the factors which affect it, and consequently the detailed methods of application and their effects are almost a matter for conjecture. We do not know the degree of intensity at which a German air offensive could be sustained in the face of heavy casualties. We do not know the extent to which the civilian population will stand up to continued heavy losses of life and property." 24 326   ## p. 327 (#347) ############################################  However, evidence did exist on the difficulty of locating and damaging targets. In May 1938, the Assistant Chief of Air Staff admitted that it remains true, however, that in the home defense exercise last year, bombing accuracy was very poor indeed. Investigation into this matter indicates that this was probably due very largely to [the] failure to identify targets rather than to fatigue." 25 A 1937 experiment underlined the extent of the accuracy problem. The RAF placed 30 obsolete aircraft within the circumference of a circle possessing a 1,000- yard diameter. For one week, Bomber Command attacked the stationary aircraft from high and low level. At the test's completion, the effort had destroyed only 2 aircraft, had damaged 11 beyond repair, had left 6 damaged but reparable, and had missed 11 entirely. 26 The First World War had already indicated that night bombing represented an even more complex challenge than daylight operations. In September 1917, Lieutenant Commander Lord Tiverton of the Royal Naval Air Service reported to the Air Board that "experience has shown that it is quite easy for five squadrons to set out to bomb a particular target and for only one of those five ever
