of the Royal Naval Air Service reported to the Air Board that "experience has shown that it is quite easy for five squadrons to set out to bomb a particular target and for only one of those five ever to reach the objective; while the other four, in the honest belief that they had done so, have bombed four different villages which bore little, if any, resemblance to the one they desired to attack."'27 These difficulties in finding and then hitting targets whether by day or by night plagued British airmen and scientists despite the immense resources that were available to them throughout the Second World War. The poor bombing capability in the 1930's, given the available assets, is not particularly surprising. Nevertheless, where the Air Staff is vulnerable to criticism lies in its unwarranted confidence that no substantial problems existed and, therefore, its general unwillingness to initiate an effort to address these difficulties. This emphasis on "strategic" bombing as the doctrine seriously affected the development of other aspects of airpower in Britain during the interwar period. Even air defense, which would win the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940, received little recognition from the Air Staff during the early 1930's. The RAF's position was that air defense had little prospect of blunting an enemy bombing offensive and, therefore, represented a waste of aircraft and resources. Sir Warren Fischer of the Treasury reflected bitterly over the course of the rearmament debates in a letter to the Prime Minister in October 1938. He recalled that: When I insisted on the insertion in the report of passages such as these on the need to build up Britain's air defense system, the representative of the Air Staff acquiesced with a shrug of his shoulders. The Air Staff proposals were, of course, again quite insufficient. 28 In February 1937, the RAF set forth its estimates on the air threat from Germany over the coming two years. Among other things, it argued that G
