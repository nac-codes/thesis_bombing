proposals were, of course, again quite insufficient. 28 In February 1937, the RAF set forth its estimates on the air threat from Germany over the coming two years. Among other things, it argued that Germany's bombing capacity would increase 600 percent in 1937 and that a German air offensive in 1939 would do ten times more damage than an attack in 1937. The underlying 327   ## p. 328 (#348) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT assumption was that air defense could play little role in counteracting this massive German buildup. Among the Chiefs of Staff, only the Chief of Naval Staff, Lord Chatfield, cast doubts on the Air Staff's pessimistic estimates. Referring to the resources that the government had allocated to defensive measures, Chatfield felt that it was illogical to estimate German capability at such a high level.29 Ironically, it was the Chamberlain government, which for the most part had an abysmal record in rearmament, and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, in particular, that forced an unwilling Air Ministry to invest substantial resources in air defense. The Air Staff itself pushed the development of the two-seater as the fighter of the future. 30 A memorandum generated during the late spring of 1938 argued that: The speed of modern bombers is so great that it is only worthwhile to attack them under conditions which allow no relative motion between the fighter and its target. The fixed-gun fighter with guns firing ahead can only realize these conditions by attacking the bomber from dead astern. The duties of a fighter engaged in "air superiority" fighting will be the destruction of opposing fighters... For these purposes, it requires an armament that can be used defensively as well as offensively in order to enable it to penetrate into enemy territory and withdraw at will. The fixed-gun fighter cannot do this.3 31 Slessor, from the planning staff in the Air Ministry, had suggested in 1936 that the RAF needed only a few singl
