te into enemy territory and withdraw at will. The fixed-gun fighter cannot do this.3 31 Slessor, from the planning staff in the Air Ministry, had suggested in 1936 that the RAF needed only a few single seaters for air defense since the two-seater offered better prospects of employment.32 It was only because of Dowding's spirited objections to the two-seater "Defiant" in June 1938 that the British maintained a high level of "Spitfire" and "Hurricane" production. 33 It is worth emphasizing that the creation of Fighter Command as an effective defense force and the articulation and conception of an air defense system was due almost entirely to Dowding. As the Air Member for Supply and Research in the early thirties, he provided critical support for the development of radar as well as for the single-seater fighter. As the Commander of Fighter Command in the late thirties, he waged a lonely fight with the Air Staff to build up an integrated air defense system based on the "Spitfire" and "Hurricane."34 He then conducted and won the Battle of Britain with the force and strategy that he had created great a conceptual triumph as the creation of the German panzer force. surely as Dowding was helped considerably by Chamberlain's refusal to buy a big bomber air force. As was the case with so many defense decisions made in the thirties, the preference for fighters over bombers stemmed from the fact that fighters were cheaper rather than from any firm belief in the efficacy of air defense. In this case, given the enormous cost of a bomber program and the scarcity of resources available for repairing Britain's military unpreparedness, feelings that Britain could only afford a major fighter program seem quite reasonable. 35 Unfortunately, even here shortsightedness dominated; after the Munich Conference of September 1938, the Cabinet addressed the obvious weaknesses of the air defense system through the dubious expedient of increasing the numbers of fighters on order by extending th
