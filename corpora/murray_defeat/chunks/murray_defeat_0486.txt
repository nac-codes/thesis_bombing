Thus, there was no effort to increase substantively fighter production after Munich. The fact that "Spitfire" and "Hurricane" production was marginally exceeding production targets throughout the post-Munich period suggests that production might have increased almost immediately and certainly within six months. 36 It was not. The record of the Air Staff concerning other aspects of airpower was scarcely better than its record on fighters; furthermore, it was in no way mitigated by interference from the Chamberlain government. The RAF resolutely rejected close air support as one of its missions. After a 1939 combined exercise, General Sir Archibald Wavell commented that the RAF had obviously given no thought to supporting ground operations, and thus its pilots were incapable of performing that mission.37 He was substantially correct. In a 1937 Chiefs of Staff meeting, the army minister, Leslie Hore-Belisha, suggested that the Spanish Civil War indicated the value of close air support. The CAS immediately asserted that this was a gross misuse of airpower. Air Ministry reports, he added, disclosed that the Italians had been so impressed with low flying support missions that they had diverted 50 percent of their aircraft to that mission. He hoped that such reports were true but doubted whether the Italians would be so stupid.38 As late as November 1939, Air Staff doctrine on close air support ran along the following lines: Briefly the Air Staff view-which is based on a close study of the subject over many years-is as follows: The true function of bomber aircraft in support of an army is to isolate the battlefi
