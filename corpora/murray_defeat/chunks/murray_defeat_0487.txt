ng lines: Briefly the Air Staff view-which is based on a close study of the subject over many years-is as follows: The true function of bomber aircraft in support of an army is to isolate the battlefield from reinforcement and supply, to block or delay the movement of reserves, and generally to create disorganization and confusion behind the enemy front. . . . But neither in attack nor in defense should bombers be used on the battlefield itself, save in exceptional circumstances. . . . All experience of war proves that such action is not only very costly in casualties but is normally uneconomical and ineffective compared with the results of the correct employment of aircraft on the lines above. 39 The above is indeed a somewhat surprising document when one considers that the Polish campaign had just ended. In France in 1940, requests by the First Armored Division for close air support met with objections that such calls were impracticable and unnecessary.40 Moreover, in July 1938, the Chiefs of Staff dismissed the employment of parachute troops with the argument that such a task would divert aircraft from more useful employment as bombers.41 The result of such attitudes was that the RAF neither possessed the aircraft nor the training to carry out interdiction, close air support, or transport missions at the outbreak of war in 1939. Only at a great cost in aircraft and crews would the RAF develop these capabilities in North Africa.42 In 1936, Harris-working in the Plans Division of the Air Staff-claimed that reconnaissance of enemy bases was the only way to locate naval forces and that the employment of aircraft over the ocean would be a waste of effort. In addition, Harris told the Joint Planning Committee that the Air Staff reserved the right, at any 329   ## p. 330 (#350) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT time, to withdraw aircraft from subsidiary missions (i.e., naval support or reconnaissance) for use in the primary mission of "st
