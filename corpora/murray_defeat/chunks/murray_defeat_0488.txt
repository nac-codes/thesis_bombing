350) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT time, to withdraw aircraft from subsidiary missions (i.e., naval support or reconnaissance) for use in the primary mission of "strategic" bombing.43 Not until late 1937 did the CAS unwillingly concede that aircraft allocated for convoy protection could only be transferred by the Air Staff to other functions with the approval of the Chiefs of Staff and War Cabinet.44 RAF attitudes provided substantial support to the appeasement of Germany. The belief in RAF circles that the Luftwaffe was preparing to launch a "bolt from the blue" played a major role in framing the gloomy prognostications that Chamberlain used to such effect in persuading his Cabinet to support his policies.45 Symptomatic of the atmosphere created by fear of an air war was the December 1938 warning issued by the Emergency Reconstruction Committee of the CID (Committee of Imperial Defense): On the assumption that the enemy may make his maximum effort at the beginning of the war, the estimate accepted by the CID is that the weight of bombs dropped might be 6,000 tons during the first week and 7,000 during the next fortnight. It had been in this connection estimated that a 500-lb bomb dropped on a built-up area like London would on the average destroy 8 and damage 92 homes. If, therefore, every bomb found a previously undamaged target in a closely built-up area, then in the first three weeks 465,000 would be totally destroyed and 5,375,000 damaged out of some 14 million houses in the country." 46 Even this Committee found such an assumption "extravagant," but the damage had been done. The conclusion by the Air Ministry in September 1938 that, in the final analysis, fear of a German "bolt from the blue" was unwarranted could not counteract the impression that many appeasers had gained from the Air Staff's apocalyptic estimates. As Sir Samuel Hoare argued to his colleagues in the Cabinet over an army report on a possible land commitment
