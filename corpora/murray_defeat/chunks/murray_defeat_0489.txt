the impression that many appeasers had gained from the Air Staff's apocalyptic estimates. As Sir Samuel Hoare argued to his colleagues in the Cabinet over an army report on a possible land commitment to the continent: The impression made upon him by the report was that it did not envisage the kind of war that seemed most probable. In a war against Germany, our own home defences would be the defensive position behind the Maginot Line. . . . The problem was to win the war over London. . . . We should need in the initial stages all our available troops to assist in the defense of this country.47 In summation, the myopia of the Air Staff hindered the development of a broadly based conception of airpower in Great Britain. Admittedly, Trenchard's devotion to his service and his advocacy of airpower saved the Royal Air Force as an independent service. Moreover, one must admit that the evidence from World War I did not provide clear, unambiguous evidence on the impact of airpower. But when all is said and done, too many of those in the higher positions of the Royal Air Staff between the wars allowed doctrine to become dogma and failed to examine the assumptions on which they based their air strategy in the light of current capability and the difficulties that emerged just in peacetime flying. The result was that outside of air defense-and the Air Staff's role there was somewhat ambiguousâ€” 330   ## p. 331 (#351) ############################################  the RAF had prepared only for "strategic" bombing; in all the other aspects of airpower (close air support, interdiction, airborne operations, long-range reconniassance, and maritime operations), the Royal Air Force had done far too little in anticipating the requirements of the coming war. THE DEVELOPMENT OF AIRPOWER IN THE UNITED STATES The peculiar position of the United States, isolated geographically from European centers of power, had a decided impact on the development and articulation of American airpower both be
