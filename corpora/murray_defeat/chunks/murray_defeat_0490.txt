UNITED STATES The peculiar position of the United States, isolated geographically from European centers of power, had a decided impact on the development and articulation of American airpower both before and during the Second World War. The nature of the American continent, relatively secure from the direct threat of enemy attack, enabled the United States to maximize her reserves of manpower and industrial plant. If that security allowed the United States to build up its military potential undisturbed, it also made it exceedingly difficult to bring that military potential to bear: The distance from America to the centers of enemy power required a logistical structure reaching out from America across several thousand miles of ocean. Throughout the prewar period, that very geographic isolation had the predictable effect of encouraging American politicians to believe that the United States was immune from the diseases of war and power politics that beset the rest of the world. The naiveté that characterized the debate over foreign policy spilled over into discussions of national security. As in Britain, there was little money available for the services: In this case, only two-the army and the navy. Locked within the body of an unsympathetic army, air enthusiasts increasingly advocated a theory of airpower as an independent strategic force capable of deciding the next war by itself. This line of argumentation undoubtedly served a similar political purpose to that of Trenchard and the Air Ministry in Britain. In the case of the latter, the "strategic" bombing argument provided a raison d'être for the continued independence of the RAF, while in the former arguments for "strategic" bombing suggested an independent role for the Air Corps and eventual independence from the army. The evolution of American "strategic" bombing theory, however, differed considerably from British doctrine. Whereas the British became enamoured with a direct assault on an enemy's population to br
