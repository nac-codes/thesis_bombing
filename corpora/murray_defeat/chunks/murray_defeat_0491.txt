y. The evolution of American "strategic" bombing theory, however, differed considerably from British doctrine. Whereas the British became enamoured with a direct assault on an enemy's population to break his morale, Army Air Corps thinkers turned to a more sophisticated, surgical approach to "strategic" bombing. Instead of attacking an enemy's morale directly, they suggested that precision bombing could take out a critical element of an enemy's economic structure with a relatively few aircraft. This approach would minimize civilian casualties, destroy the enemy's economy, and cause a general collapse of morale. The elements in this theory were not necessarily unique to American thinkers,48 but American attitudes in this period made the theory particularly attractive. It appealed to a growing American enthrallment with technology, and it reflected an idealistic intellectualism that would have been appalled at a direct assault on the enemy's population. American "strategic" bombing theory did not immediately emerge from World War I. It took longer to evolve into its final form of the late 1930's and drew from a 331   ## p. 332 (#352) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT wider variety of sources than had British thought. The development of American airpower theories grew out of collective experiences of World War I, especially among those American flyers assigned to fight in France. "Billy" Mitchell, whose argumentative personality dominated the early history of American airpower, was influenced not only by aerial combat but also by meeting British air officers, especially Trenchard.49 If Mitchell's stridency set the tone for the debate in the United States, his view on airpower differed substantially from Trenchard's or Douhet's. Mitchell remained a firm believer in the importance of gaining and of maintaining air superiority. Unlike many British or his successors in the Air Corps Tactical School, Mitchell argued strongly for pursuit aviat
