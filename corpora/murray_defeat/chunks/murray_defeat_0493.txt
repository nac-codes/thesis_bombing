air branches is impossible."'52 Nevertheless, if pursuit aviation received pride of place at first, certain factors pushed the school's doctrine in another direction. The goal of air superiority seemed to serve a largely negative function: Its achievement had little impact unless one could utilize it to accomplish further tasks. In the mid-1920's, American thinkers turned increasingly to bombardment as the exclusive mission for aircraft. Here the lessons of the last war were moot. There had not ever been sufficient bombing capability in the war to have a decisive impact on events. With little historical evidence available, the theorists (as in Italy and Britain) thought in terms of future potential rather than past experience. The tendency, quite naturally, was to cast that potential by referring to aircraft not yet on the drawing boards. Even in the early 1920's, those interested in bombardment argued that defensive machineguns and "compact formations" could protect bombers sufficiently against enemy fighters. Altitude and speed would also help. The actual mission of bombardment 332   ## p. 333 (#353) ############################################  aircraft would be to attack enemy airbases, thereby assisting fighters in the destruction of enemy forces. There does not seem to have been much target analysis beyond enemy air forces. 53 At the mid-point in the 1920's, a significant shift away from pursuit aviation towards bombardment took place. Where early training manuals had discussed the potential of aerial bombardment, the manual for the 1925-26 academic year emphasized more forcefully the role of bombardment in air warfare. 54 Moreover, where previous texts had pointed at the enemy's air forces as the chief target, Air Corps thinkers now suggested that independent strategic operations could achieve a decisive impact by destroying the enemy's will to resist. By 1926, training manuals argued that bombardment might "have a direct, although not . . immediate effect...
