ments. Finally, certain technical changes, such as heavier bomb weights and more capable bombers, suggested a greater capability for bombing than had hitherto been possible. The result was that, while earlier instructors at the Air Corps Tactical School had recognized that combat experience in the last war indicated that bombers would suffer unnecessarily high losses when not protected by fighters, the emphasis on bombardment at the school became increasingly an emphasis on bombing unprotected by pursuit aviation.59 These developments in targeting doctrine and theory occurring in the middle 1920's were decisive for future formulations. The changes that took place from this point on represented refinements rather than changes in basic philosophy. For obvious reasons, daylight operations would simplify the problems of navigation and bombing accuracy; as was to be the case in Britain, the first advances in design that moved aircraft capabilities beyond those of the last war came in bomber design. 333   ## p. 334 (#354) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT Thus, the new bomber aircraft that the Air Corps possessed through the thirties enjoyed superiority over most fighter aircraft in nearly every performance characteristic. Combined with the enhanced flying capabilities were new increased defensive armament. Furthermore, since there was little combat experience on which to draw, Air Corps thinkers emphasized the defensive potential of daylight bomber formations. As early as 1930, one text used at the Air Corps Tactical School suggested that: Bombardment formations may suffer defeat at the hands of hostile pursuit; but with a properly constituted formation, efficiently flown, these defeats will be the exception rather than the rule. Losses must be expected, but these losses will be minimized by proper defensive tactics.60 The combination of easier operating conditions, the assumed defensive capacity of bomber formations, and the small differe
