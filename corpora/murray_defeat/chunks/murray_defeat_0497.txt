One veteran of the school recalled that the foremost pursuit expert, the future General Claire Chennault, showed little interest in using fighters to escort bombers.64 America's geographic isolation also reinforced the direction of Air Corps thinking. It was hard to imagine an enemy bomber force acquiring bases from which it could attack the United States. Thus, air defense never had the significance that it came to have in Britain. Moreover, bomber-pursuit exercises heavily favored the former, thus furthering the impression of bomber invulnerability.65 Arguments between navy and Air Corps pioneers like Mitchell had centered on the issue of which was more suitable for the defense of America: bombers or battleships. In its first taste of interservice squabbling, the early Air 334   ## p. 335 (#355) ############################################  66 Service articulated a position that bombers could protect the United States from an enemy at less cost and with greater effectiveness than could the navy. That argument remained alive until World War II.67 For using airpower to attack and destroy an enemy's will, American geography similarly favored the bomber. Although the United States had suffered relatively few casualties in the First World War compared to European nations, American popular opinion had reacted almost as violently in the post-World War I era to the terrible bloodletting in the trenches as public opinion in France and Britain. As with the RAF, American airpower theorists argued that by attacking the enemy directly through aerial bombardment, the Air Corps could destroy his economy and break his will to resist-all at little cost and few casualties. The fundamental assumption was that airpower offered an escape from the trenches and horror of the last war. As Harold George suggested in a lecture: "Airpower has given to the world a means whereby the heart of a nation can be attacked at once without first having to wage an exhausting war at the nation's fronti
