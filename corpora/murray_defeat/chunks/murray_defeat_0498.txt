rold George suggested in a lecture: "Airpower has given to the world a means whereby the heart of a nation can be attacked at once without first having to wage an exhausting war at the nation's frontier."'68 Moreover, bombers could deploy from the United States to overseas far more quickly than a great army. While early arguments had centered on attacking the enemy's aircraft industry as a means of defeating his air force, instructors at the school now looked for specific industries, the destruction of which would handicap not merely an industry but perhaps the entire economy. Interestingly, the 1932-33 manual suggested that destruction of the enemy's fuel industry would render an opponent's air forces harmless and make further attacks on engine and aircraft factories, or airfields unnecessary.69 Acquisition of the B-17 and Norden bombsights in the mid-thirties gave the Air Corps an aircraft capability to fulfill what had hitherto only been theory. In the last half of the 1930's, the general theory that targeting an attack on the enemy's industrial base could prove decisive went one step further and became a specific argument that sought to identify targets within an industry or within the economy. The destruction of these targets would so dislocate or disorganize the enemy that his economy could no longer function. Again, George noted: "It appears that nations are susceptible to defeat by the interruption of this economic web. It is possible that the morale collapse brought about by the breakup of this closely knit web would be sufficient, but connected therewith is the industrial fabric which is absolutely essential for modern war. '70 Contributing further to the elaboration of this theory of precise, exact targeting was the Army Air Corps' force structure in the late thirties. Neither for the present nor for the immediate future was it realistic to forecast a large bomber fleet. Thus, a target doctrine in which a small number of bomber aircraft using precision bo
