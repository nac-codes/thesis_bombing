thirties. Neither for the present nor for the immediate future was it realistic to forecast a large bomber fleet. Thus, a target doctrine in which a small number of bomber aircraft using precision bombing could break the back of the enemy's economic system obviously possessed great appeal for the theorists. They argued, for example, that the destruction of 49 selected electric plants in the northeastern United States should prove sufficient to strain the economic capacity of the nation to the breaking point.71 By the end of the 1930's, airpower theorists in the Army Air Corps had evolved a theory of air warfare that was a precisely thoughtout body of interconnected 335   ## p. 336 (#356) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT assumptions. They based their argument on the belief that a well-led, disciplined bomber formation could fight its way through enemy controlled airspace unsupported by fighter escort. Once the bomber force had made its high altitude, deep penetration, it could, through precision bombing aided by the technological means provided by the Norden bombsight, place an adequate number of bombs on the selected target to assure destruction. That target would represent a section in the enemy's economic web, and its destruction would result in wide dislocation within his economy. The full impact of these dislocations would eventually destroy both the means and the will of the enemy to resist. The theory was undoubtedly the most carefully conceived of all the theories and strategies that airpower enthusiasts hammered out between the wars. Considering that little information was available based on actual combat experience, its evolution represented a triumph of human ingenuity and imagination. Given the many unknowns, the planners had to work with a body of assumptions. What they were unwilling to see was the fact that the relationship between these assumptions was geometric rather than arithemetic. There was then an accumulation
