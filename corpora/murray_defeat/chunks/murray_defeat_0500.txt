to work with a body of assumptions. What they were unwilling to see was the fact that the relationship between these assumptions was geometric rather than arithemetic. There was then an accumulation of risk that made the theory unrealistic and unworkable. As one commentator on the development of doctrine in the Air Corps Tactical School has noted: By accepting a concept based upon nonaccumulation of risks or problems, the school admitted its inability to recognize that in the realm of force application, a single factor or condition cannot be changed without affecting all other factors. The school ignored what seemingly was obvious: that each premise, supported by assumptions, contained inherent weaknesses. Taken individually, the shortcomings were not serious; if taken collectively, they might have undermined the entire concept. 72 What needs emphasis is not the supposed faults in the doctrine evolved by these Air Corps theorists but rather the difficulty in peacetime in calculating on the basis of existing information, the nature of a future war. In fact, the real lesson may be that when one embarks upon a military campaign after a long period of peace, one must recognize that much of peacetime doctrine, training, and preparation will prove faulty. The truly effective military organization is one that recognizes and adapts to real conditions on the battlefield and absorbs its combat experience into its doctrine and training. The serious questions that one can raise against those who led the air war against Germany does not deal with the evolution of doctrine and theory through 1939 but rather whether the leaders adapted their tactics, equipment, and strategy to the conditions of air war in Europe from 1939-43, or whether they allowed preconceived judgments to filter out reality until "Black Thursday" over Schweinfurt faced them with defeat. 336   ## p. 337 (#357) ############################################  Notes 1.
