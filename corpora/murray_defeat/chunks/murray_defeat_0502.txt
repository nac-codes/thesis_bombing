The Luftwaffe faced the basic same choice, between a two-seater (the Me 110) and a single-seater (the Me 109). It did, however, opt proportionately for considerably more Me 110's than the RAF opted for Boulton Paul "Defiants." This is probably a result of Dowding's strong objections to the two-seater program. 31.
