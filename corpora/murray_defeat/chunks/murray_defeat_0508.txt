y available source that can give a picture of the impact of losses on the Luftwaffe. One must note that these records are based on when aircraft and crews were reported lost rather than when they were actually lost. Thus, there is at least a week's time lag. Nevertheless, the trends that these records indicate are unmistakable. In the United States, two sources duplicate a portion of the records available in Germany. At Maxwell AFB, Alabama, the Albert F. Simpson Historical Research Center (AFSHRC) possesses a duplicate set (the other set is in Freiburg) of the historical and documentary material collected for the American Air Force's historical project on the Luftwaffe. This set contains post-war written reports on aspects of the Luftwaffe's history by various senior officers as well as a sizable collection of typed extracts from archival material. It is apparent that some of the historians working on this project had access to the von Rohden collection as well as other material that the British had captured at the end of the war and which in the 1950's was located in the Air Historical Branch, London. The National Archives and Record Service (NARS) in Washington, D.C., possesses a microfilm set of the small section of Luftwaffe archival materials captured by American forces at the end of the war. More importantly, they also possess a full microfilm set of the von Rohden collection, which represents the holdings of the Luftwaffe general staff's historical section. This is an important and useful collection; its holdings are duplicated in Freiburg. The somewhat spotty documentary material can and should be supplemented with a variety of other materials available to the researcher. The "Ultra" decrypts available in the Public Record Office (PRO), London, England, give a useful look at the operational message traffic of the German armed forces.
