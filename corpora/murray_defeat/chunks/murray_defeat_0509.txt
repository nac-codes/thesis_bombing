useful look at the operational message traffic of the German armed forces. The messages 347   ## p. 348 (#368) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT themselves range from critical pieces of information to reports on venereal disease cases on individual ships. These messages are also of use in evaluating what was available to Allied intelligence sources. In the PRO, the DEFE series contains the messages pertaining to German army and air force matters. It is useful for evaluating the actual German situations as well as establishing when Allied commanders were informed about German strategic moves. Thus, from these records one can establish what was known and when. It is worth noting that only one historical work has examined this material with consistency. Ralph Bennett's Ultra in the West (London, 1980) is an invaluable study of the impact of "Ultra" on the western campaign from 1944 forward. The ADM series covers the naval intercepts and is critical for an understanding of the war in the Atlantic. Obviously, it had less importance for this study than the DEFE series. Complementing this source is a valuable history of “Ultra” and its impact on American air operations that was written at the conclusion of the war: "Ultra, History of US Strategic Air Force Europe Versus German Air Force," June 1945, SRH-013. It contains many direct quotes from "Ultra" decrypts and is available in the NARS. The above material on “Ultra" is particularly important for a study of the Luftwaffe, since so much of the operational record was destroyed at the end of the war. Also of use are the 'Y' Service intercepts and reconstruction of the response of the German night fighter force to British night raids. That material is available in the PRO. The records of Bomber Command in the PRO are useful in reconstructing the debates on British bombing policy within the Air Ministry. On the losses suffered by Allied bomber fleets, there are two particularly useful compilati
