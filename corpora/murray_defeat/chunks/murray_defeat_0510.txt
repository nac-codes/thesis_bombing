mmand in the PRO are useful in reconstructing the debates on British bombing policy within the Air Ministry. On the losses suffered by Allied bomber fleets, there are two particularly useful compilations: "War Room Manual of Bomber Command Operations 1939-1945," compiled by the Air Ministry War Room (Statistical Section) and located in the PRO; and "Statistical Summary of Eighth Air Force Operations, European Theater, 17.8.42.-8.5.45.," located in the AFSHRC. On the American and British side, I have also made some use of the extensive records available on the development of doctrine and the course of the air campaigns in Europe. These records are available in Britain at the PRO and at the RAF Staff College, Bracknell; and in the United States, at the AFSHRC. At the latter archives, the records and texts of the Air Corps Tactical School are particularly interesting and important for the development of American prewar doctrine. PUBLISHED DOCUMENTARY SOURCES There are a number of published documentary sources available that have bearing on the study of German military and Luftwaffe history. The published volumes of documents collected for the prosecution of the major war criminals (International Military Tribunal, The Trial of Major War Criminals) contain some useful information on the Luftwaffe and are important sources for German strategy in general. The collections of German diplomatic papers, published both in the original and in translation (Akten zur deutschen auswärtigen Politik and Documents on German Foreign Policy), provide an excellent guide to the evolution of German 348   ## p. 349 (#369) ############################################  diplomacy and include some of the more important military documents. Karl-Heinz Völker, Dokumente und Dokumentarfotos zur Geschichte der Deutschen Luftwaffe (Stuttgart, 1968), has important documents on the prewar development of the German air force. H. R.
