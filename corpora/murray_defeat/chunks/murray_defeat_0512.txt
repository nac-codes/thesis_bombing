Germany, Vol. IV (London, 1961), has an interesting collection of documents on the British side of the "strategic" bombing offensive as well as several useful tables. Hans-Adolf Jacobsen, Dokumente zur Vorgeschichte des Westfeldzuges, 1939–1940 (Göttingen, 1956), is useful on the 1940 campaign. MEMOIRS There is, of course, an immense literature of fighter pilot memoirs from the war. This study has relied on a minimum of such works and only on those which shed particular light on aspects of the war's general conduct. Walter Warlimont's Inside Hitler's Headquarters (New York, 1964) provides some insight into the workings of the OKW. Nicholaus von Below's Als Hitlers Adjutant 1937-1945 (Mainz, 1980) has recently appeared and provides an interesting look into Hitler's relationship with his military aides. It also has important information on the air war and air strategy as Below was Hitler's Luftwaffe adjutant. Albert Kesselring's A Soldier's Record (New York, 1953) is not particularly informative and leaves many important issues undiscussed. Adolf Galland's The First and the Last (New York, 1954) has much of the flavor of most fighter pilot memoirs but also has interesting material on his relationship with Göring. As for bomber pilots, see Werner 349   ## p. 350 (#370) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT Baumbach's The Life and Death of the Luftwaffe (New York, 1960). Concerning the German economy, there are two important memoirs that one should consult: Albert Speer's Inside the Third Reich (New York, 1970) provides the reader with an important insight into the functioning of the war economy from 1942 on and also a sense of the ambiance of life at the highest levels of the Third Reich; conversely, Georg Thomas' Geschichte der deutschen Wehr- und Rüstungswirtschaft 1918-1943/45 (Boppard am Rhein, 1966) is a valuable source of the prewar and early wartime periods. The British memoir sources on the air war are extensive and enlightening. Mar
