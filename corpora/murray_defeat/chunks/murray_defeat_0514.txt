and historical objectivity. It examines both the larger questions of German preparation for the war as well as the specific rearmament issues involved with the three services. The second volume, Klaus Maier, Horst Rohde, Bernd Stegmann, and Hans Umbreit, Das deutsche Reich und der Zweite Weltkrieg, Vol. II, Die Errichtung der Hegemonie auf dem Europ√§ischen Kontinent (Stuttgart, 1979), meets the same standards and contains a groundbreaking discussion of German air doctrine in the prewar period. One of the most important series of official histories is the Grand Strategy series done by the official historians in Great Britain. Of particular use to this study from that series are the following volumes: J. R. M. Butler, Grand Strategy, Vol. II, September 1939-June 1941 (London, 1957); and especially Michael Howard, Grand Strategy, Vol. IV, August 1942-September 1943 (London, 1972). The three-volume set (with one additional volume of appendices) by Sir Charles 350   ## p. 351 (#371) ############################################  Webster and Noble Frankland, The Strategic Air Offensive Against Germany (London, 1961), is arguably the best work yet done on this aspect of the air war. Basil Collier's The Defense of the United Kingdom (London, 1957) contains important information on the air defense of the United Kingdom. The first volume of a new history on the role of British intelligence in the war, F. H. Hinsley, E. E. Thomas, C. F. G. Ransom, R. C. Knight, British Intelligence in the Second World War, Vol. I (London, 1979), contains useful information but is disappointing in many respects. Its style is generally undistinguished and its knowledge of what was happening in Germany rather superficial. This study has also consulted a number of other British official histories peripherally: Llewellyn Woodward, British Foreign Policy in the Second World War (London, 1962); L. F. Ellis, The War in France and Flanders, 1939-1940 (London, 1955); I. S. O. Playfair, The Mediterranean
