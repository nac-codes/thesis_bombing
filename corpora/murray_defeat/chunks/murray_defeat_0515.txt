pherally: Llewellyn Woodward, British Foreign Policy in the Second World War (London, 1962); L. F. Ellis, The War in France and Flanders, 1939-1940 (London, 1955); I. S. O. Playfair, The Mediterranean and the Middle East, Vol. I (London, 1974); and L. F. Ellis, The War in the West, Vol. I (London, 1962). In the United States, the official history of air operations appeared soon after the war was over. Nevertheless, Wesley F. Craven and James L. Cate, The Army Air Forces in World War II (Chicago, 1948) still holds up well, although certain issues understandably are not examined in full detail. The Green series, produced in many volumes by the Office of Chief of Military History, are all of high quality but are somewhat tangential to the issues discussed in this work. GENERAL HISTORIES One of the most important books on the defeat of the Luftwaffe was written by anonymous authors in the British Air Ministry shortly after the war was over. This work never appeared in general print but can be read in a number of archives including the AFSHRC and the AHB: Air Ministry, The Rise and Fall of the German Air Force (London, 1948). Perhaps the most provocative and challenging work on the strategic bombing offensive is Anthony Verrier, The Bomber Offensive (London, 1968). Read with the official histories (American and British), one can gain deep insights into the nature of the problems faced during the bomber campaign. Noble Frankland has produced a readable, incisive summary of the overall bombing offensive for Ballantine Books: Noble Frankland, Bomber Offensive, The Devastation of Europe (New York, 1970). He has also written an excellent summary of British operations, The Bombing Offensive Against Germany (London, 1965). Both works are useful departure points. The multivolume set by Dennis Richards, The Royal Air Force, 1939-1945 (London, 1953), is somewhat dated but still useful. Richard Overy's The Air War, 1939â€“1945 (London, 1980) represents a new departure; and while it c
