by Dennis Richards, The Royal Air Force, 1939-1945 (London, 1953), is somewhat dated but still useful. Richard Overy's The Air War, 1939–1945 (London, 1980) represents a new departure; and while it contains several small errors, it puts the air war into a much larger perspective than most historians have been willing to address. The sections dealing with production questions are particularly important. David Irving's The Rise and Fall of the Luftwafe, The Life of Field Marshal Erhard Milch (Boston, 1973) is uneven but contains some interesting observations. Horst Boog's "High Command and Leadership in the German Luftwaffe, 1935-1945," in Air Power and Warfare, Proceedings of the Eighth Military History Symposium, 351   ## p. 352 (#372) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT USAF Academy, edited by Colonel Alfred F. Hurley and Major Robert C. Ehrhart (Washington, 1979), is a valuable piece. B. H. Liddell Hart's History of the Second World War (New York, 1971) has a particularly insightful chapter dealing with the issues involved in the "strategic" bombing offensive. John Killen's History of the Luftwaffe (London, 1966) and Cajus Bekker, The Luftwafe War Diaries (New York, 1968) add little to the subject. Richard Suchenwirth's Historical Turning Points in the German Air Force War Effort (USAF Historical Study No. 189, 1968) contains some interesting points as does that author's Command and Leadership in the German Air Force (USAF Historical Study No. 174, 1969). THE PREWAR PERIOD Several important works exist on the Luftwaffe in the period before the war. The best of these in German are Karl-Heinz Völker, "Die Entwicklung der militärischen Luftfahrt in Deutschland, 1920-1933," in Beitrage zur Militär-und Kriegsgeschichte, Vol. III (Stuttgart, 1962), and Karl-Heinz Völker, Die deutsche Luftwaffe, 1933-1939: Aufbau, Führung und Rüstung der Luftwaffe sowie die Entwicklung der deutschen Luftkriegstheorie (Stuttgart, 1967). Both of these are inf
