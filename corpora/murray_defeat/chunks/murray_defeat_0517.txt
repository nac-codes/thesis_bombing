962), and Karl-Heinz Völker, Die deutsche Luftwaffe, 1933-1939: Aufbau, Führung und Rüstung der Luftwaffe sowie die Entwicklung der deutschen Luftkriegstheorie (Stuttgart, 1967). Both of these are informative on the creation of the Luftwaffe before the war. In English, Edward Homze's Arming the Luftwaffe, The Reich Air Ministry and the German Aircraft Industry, 1919-1939 (Lincoln, 1976) is excellent concerning German armament production and air rearmament issues. It also contains useful and perceptive comments about the German military's role. For the early developments of the Nazi rearmament effort, see Edward W. Bennett's German Rearmament and the West, 1932-1933 (Princeton, 1979). Wilhelm Deist's The Wehrmacht and German Rearmament (London, 1981) is the most important book on German rearmament in English in the last ten years. It has an excellent discussion on the Luftwaffe's place in Germany's preparation for war. On early strategic thinking in the Luftwaffe, see particularly: Bernard Heimann and Joachim Scunke, "Eine geheime Denkschrift zur Luftkriegskonzeption Hitler-Deutschlands vom Mai 1933," Zeitschrift für Militärgeschichte, Vol. III (1964). Richard Overy's "The German Pre-War Aircraft Production Plans: November 1936-April 1939," English Historical Review (1975) gives an interesting account of the muddle in prewar production. It draws upon his important dissertation: "German Aircraft Production 1939-1942: A Study in the German War Economy," Cambridge University dissertation, 1977. Richard Suchenwirth's The Development of the German Air Force is dated and somewhat tendentious but does contain useful information. On the Luftwaffe's involvement in the Spanish Civil War, Klaus Maier's Guernica (Freiburg, 1975) is the best work. There are several other works on the Luftwaffe's preparation in the prewar period: Herbert Mason, Jr., The Rise of the Luftwaffe, 1918–1940 (New York, 1973), and Hanfried Schliephake, Birth of the Luftwaffe (Chicago, 1971).
