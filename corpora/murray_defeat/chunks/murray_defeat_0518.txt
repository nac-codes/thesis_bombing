Luftwaffe's preparation in the prewar period: Herbert Mason, Jr., The Rise of the Luftwaffe, 1918–1940 (New York, 1973), and Hanfried Schliephake, Birth of the Luftwaffe (Chicago, 1971). The Schliephake work is more careful; the Mason work indicates little research. For an evaluation of the preparedness of air forces to fight in 1938 during the Czech crisis, see my article, "German Air Power and the Munich Crisis,' War and Society, Vol. II, edited by Brian Bond and Ian Roy (London, 1975). On German 99 352   ## p. 353 (#373) ############################################  foreign policy in the 1930's, Gerhard Weinberg's two-volume set (particularly the first volume), The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany, Vol. I, 1933–1936, and Vol. II, 1936-1939 (Chicago, 1970, 1981), is a useful point of departure. For the considerable economic constraints on German rearmament, see Wirtschaft und Rüstung am Vorabend des Zweiten Weltkrieges, edited by Friedrich Forstmeier and Hans-Erich Volkmann (Düsseldorf, 1975). For a comparison of the Luftwaffe and RAF, see my article "British and German Air Doctrine Between the Wars," Air University Review (March-April 1980). For a closer look at German air doctrine, see my article "The Luftwaffe Before the Second World War: A Mission, A Strategy?" in the Journal of Strategic Studies (September 1981). On the development of British doctrine before the Second World War, Barry D. Powers, Strategy Without Slide-Rule, British Air Strategy, 1914-1939 (London, 1976), is an important work. Group Captain R. A. Mason's "The British Dimension," Airpower and Warfare, edited by Alfred F. Hurley and Robert C. Ehrhard (Washington, 1979), gives a new look at the First World War and its air strategy. D. C. Watt's "The Air Force View of History," Quarterly Review (October 1962), is sharp and challenging and an important article. Basil Collier's The Leader of the Few (London, 1957) is a bit too uncritical but an important source on the career of Dowding. For the
