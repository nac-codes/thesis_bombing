A number of important works exist on the defeat of France in 1940. Among those worth consulting are Telford Taylor, The March of Conquest (New York, 1958); Alistair Horne, To Lose a Battle, France 1940 (London, 1969); and Hans-Adolf Jacobsen, Fall Gelb, Der Kampf um den deutschen Operationsplan zur Westoffensive 1940 (Wiesbaden, 1957).

Patrice Buffotot and Jacques Ogier, "L'armée de l'air francaise dans la campagne de France (10 Mai-25 Juin 1940)," Revue historique des Armées, Vol. II, No. 3, pp. 88-117, offers a unique look at the problems that the French air force faced in 1940 as well as its contributions.

Brian Johnson's The Secret War (London, 1978) looks at the development of the scientific war as well as intelligence. For the best book on the Battle of Britain, see Francis K. Mason, Battle Over Britain (New York, 1968). Telford Taylor's The Breaking Wave (New York, 1967) is also good on the wider strategic questions as well as the air battles. Basil Collier's The Battle of Britain (New York, 1962) is also useful. Adam Ulman's brilliant work, Expansion and Coexistence: History of Soviet Foreign Policy, 1917-1967 (New York, 1974), has much to say on the diplomatic background to the Russo-German War. Gerhard Weinberg's Germany and the Soviet Union, 1939-1941 (Leiden, 1954) still is useful but flawed. There are a number of impo
