, has much to say on the diplomatic background to the Russo-German War. Gerhard Weinberg's Germany and the Soviet Union, 1939-1941 (Leiden, 1954) still is useful but flawed. There are a number of important works that treat particular aspects of the 1941 campaigns. Martin van Creveld's Hitler's Strategy 1940-1941, The Balkan Clue (Cambridge, 1973) is interesting but perhaps overstated. For the spring battles, George Blau's The German Campaigns in the Balkans (Spring, 1941) (Washington, 1953) is an excellent piece of work. Hans-Otto Mühleisen, Kreta 1941, Das Unternehmen 'Merkur' (Freiburg, 1968), is a thorough battle study. For the German invasion of Russia, a number of outstanding works exist. For the intelligence background to the invasion, see Barton Whaley, Codeword Barbarossa (Cambridge, 1973). The best work on German strategy in the first years of the war is Andreas Hillgruber's monumental Hitlers Strategie (Frankfurt, 1965). George E. Blau's The German Campaign in Russia-Planning and Operations (1940-1942) (Washington, 1955) is an excellent summary for the time when it was written. The best account on Barbarossa's failure, though somewhat limited in its span of time, is Klaus Reinhardt, Die Wende vor Moskau, Das Scheitern der Strategie Hitlers im Winter 1941/42 (Stuttgart, 1972). Herman Plocher's study, The German Air Force Versus Russia, 1941 (USAF Historical Study No. 154, 1967) has much interesting information but is narrow in scope. Richard Overy's "The Luftwaffe and the German Economy 1939-1945," Militärgeschichtliche Mitteilungen 2/79, is a brillant account of why the Germans made such a hash of aircraft production in the war years. On why the campaign turned into such a terrible war of atrocity, see: Jürgen Förster's "Hitler's War Aims Against the Soviet Union and German Military Leaders," Militärhistorisk Tidskrift (Stockholm, 1979).
