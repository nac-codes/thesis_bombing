Robert Conquest's The Great Terror, Stalin's Purge of the Thirties (London, 1968) gives the political background and results of Stalin's savaging of his military services. The results, the catastrophic collapse of 1941-42, are graphically described by John Erickson, The Road to Stalingrad (New York, 1975). For the suffering of Russia's civilians, see Harrison Salisbury's The 900 Days, The Siege of Leningrad (New York, 1969). Seweryn Bialer's collection of translated Russian memoirs, Stalin and His Generals (New York, 1969), contains many interesting accounts.

For the Soviet summary in English of their great military history effort on the war, see: The Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union 1941-1945, A General Outline (Moscow, 1974). On the Russian air force, one can consult Walter Schwabedissen, The Russian Air Force in the Eyes of German Commanders (USAF Historical Study No. 175, 1960), and Klaus Uebe, Russian Reaction to German Airpower in World War II (USAF Historical Study No. 176, 1964).
