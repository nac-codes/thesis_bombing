55, 1967) has the same weaknesses of his volumes on 1941 and 1942. There are a number of important works on the German defeats in Russia in the last years of the Second World War. The best work in English is Earl F. Ziemke's excellent Stalingrad to Berlin: The German Defeat in the East (Washington, 1968). Not surprisingly, there are a number of works in German. Manfred Kehrig's Stalingrad, Analyse und Dokumentation einer Schlacht (Stuttgart, 1974) is as thorough a study of that battle as one could expect. The Battle of Kursk has also received the same sort of attention: see, in particular, E. Klink, Das Gesetz des Handelns, 'Zitadelle' 1943 (Stuttgart, 1966). A number of worthwhile pieces have appeared on various aspects of the air war in 1943-44. Martin Middlebrook has written two excellent studies that cover major incidents in those years. The first of those is The Nuremberg Raid (New York, 1974). The coverage on Bomber Command's operations was excellent; that of German operations adequate. His more recent work, The Battle of Hamburg, Allied Bomber Forces Against a German City in 1943 (London, 1980), has the same strengths and weaknesses. From the German viewpoint, Friedhelm Golücke's Schweinfurt und der strategische Luftkrieg, 1943 (Paderborn, 1980) is thorough on all aspects of the German side but leaves many aspects of the American air offensive untouched. It is an important work. David Irving's The Mare's Nest (London, 1964) is arguably his best work and covers the development of German rocket technology and the British response. While Hans Rumpf's The Bombing of 355   ## p. 356 (#376) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT Germany (New York, 1961) is much weaker than the above works, it does contain some useful statistics. Thomas M. Coffey's Decision Over Schweinfurt (New York, 1977) does not compare with Middlebrook's or Golücke's works. Max Hasting's Bomber Command (New York, 1979) is a unique mixture of squadron histories and an
