fey's Decision Over Schweinfurt (New York, 1977) does not compare with Middlebrook's or Golücke's works. Max Hasting's Bomber Command (New York, 1979) is a unique mixture of squadron histories and an operational account of the course of the British campaign. It is one of the more interesting books on the air war that have recently appeared. Gordon Musgrove's Pathfinder Force, A History of 8 Group (London, 1976) gives a close look at the development and effectiveness of Bennett's force. Werner Girbig's ... mit Kurs auf Leuna (Stuttgart, 1980) is an important account of the "strategic" bombing attacks on Germany's oil industry and the efforts of the Luftwaffe to defend its life blood. On German aircraft production during the war, see the outstanding article by R. J. Overy, "The Luftwaffe and the European Economy, 1939-1945," in Militärgeschichtliche Mitteilungen, 2/79. Olaf Groehler's "Starke, Verteilung und Verluste der deutschen Luftwaffe im Zweiten Weltkrieg," Militärgeschichte, Vol. 17 (1978) presents some interesting tables based on the loss reports of the Quartermaster General. His interpretation, colored by the political atmosphere of the GDR, leaves much to be desired. On the Normandy campaign, Ralph Bennett's Ultra in the West, The Normandy Campaign, 1944-1945 is the first work to integrate the impact of "Ultra" with supporting evidence directly into an account of ground and air operations. 356   ## p. 357 (#377) ############################################  INDEX A-4, see V2 air doctrine, interwar development summarized, xxiii-xxv; need for wartime flexibility, 336; see also Army Air Corps Tactical School, Luftwaffe, RAF, "strategic" bombing airpower, nature of in WWII, xxiv; role in German defeat, 301 Allies, aircraft production, 103, 139; Dieppe raid, 135; North Africa antishipping campaign, 162; see also RAF, USAAF Army Air Service, see USAAF Army Air Corps Tactical School, 247; and air doctrine, 333; emphasizes pursuit aviation, 332; shift to bombardment
