At the heart of this fear was a belief that modern air power would be aimed at an enemy’s home population, whose morale might crack completely under a hail of bombs, gas canisters, and biological weapons. Theseﬁrst “weapons of mass destruction” failed to materialize fully, but on the very ﬁrst morning of the European war, September 3, an air raid alarm sounded in London,triggered by an aircraft mistakenly identiﬁed as hostile. This panic-driven reaction symbolized the conviction that the new war would be decided by air power, a view unthinkable only twenty-ﬁve years before, when in 1914 a few primitive biplanes launched the air power century. In the twenty years between the First and Second World Wars, all the major European powers encouraged the development of technically advanced air forces while military thinkers grappled with the issues of how aircraft might be employed with maximum military utility. There was no consensus on the future of air power. In Germany, France, and the Soviet Union, each with a powerful army tradition, air power was regarded as something that would be exercised in conjunction with the ground forces to speed up the defeat of the enemy’s army. This involved bombing at distances a few hundred kilometers behind the front at the most, but usually much closer to it. German air doctrine showed an awareness of the possibility of long-range bombing acting independently of the ground forces, but this was regarded as something to be done under provocation or for retaliation and not as an integral element in the exercise of what German airmen called “operational air war.” 1 German theorists shared with their French counterparts the lesson of the Great War that air po
