d widespread popular demoralization—might prompt a political upheaval and force Germany to sue for peace. The idea that morale was a vulnerable target has generally been ascribed to General (later Air Marshal) Hugh T renchard, the chief of the air staff during the 1920s, who famously asserted that the effect on morale was twenty times greater than the effect of physical destruction, but ideas about the political dividend from long-range bombing were already current by 1918, promoted by the ﬁrst RAF chief of staff, Frederick Sykes. 4During the interwar years, RAF doctrine was divided between the desire to offer some effective form of defense of the home islands against air attack and the belief that the best form of defense was attack against the enemy homeland, either to act as a deterrent to further attacks or to provoke a crisis in the heart of the enemy war effort. The contradiction represented by this strategic proﬁle was never fully confronted during the interwar years. The RAF War Manual published in 1935 had as its ﬁrst line the assertion that “the bomb is the chief weapon of an air force” and went on to describe a campaign against “the nerve centres, main arteries, heart and brain” of the enemy state in order to reduce “his power to continue the war.” 5This remained the central feature of RAF strategy through 1945 and the end of the European war. The force sustained the distinction between an independent bombing strategy, with its own strategic trajectory aimed at defeating the enemy nation rather than the enemy armed forces, and the tactical use of air power in support of ground campaigns on land and sea, for which the RAF remained poorly prepared and doctrinally deﬁcient. Yet from 1936, with the advent of radar and fast monoplane ﬁghters, greater emphasis was placed, at political insistence, on the possibilities of an active air defense whose purpose was also strategic rather than tactical, denying the enemy air force the possibility of attacking the home
