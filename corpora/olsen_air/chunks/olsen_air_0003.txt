placed, at political insistence, on the possibilities of an active air defense whose purpose was also strategic rather than tactical, denying the enemy air force the possibility of attacking the home front in operations again independent of the army or navy.

There was little preparation for the use of aircraft against shipping. The Italian navy made few provisions for ﬁghting a modern air/sea war; Britain had a few aircraft carriers but little experience in how to use them; Germany had no aircraft carriers, and relations between the country’s navy and air force were too poor to develop effective air-sea operational collaboration. Air power could be exercised over sea as long as there were airﬁelds close enough to the coast to permit extensive oversea ﬂights, but much of this was improvised in wartime when the war spread to the Mediterranean theater in June 1940 and German naval and air forces began the campaign against British Atlantic trade the same month. The use of aircraft in conjunction with ground operations was thoroughly vin- dicated in the opening campaigns of the European war. The prevailing view that German success relied on overwhelming numerical superiority was certainly true in the case of the campaign against Poland, which began on September 1, 1939, when the 1,500 ﬁrst-li
