prevailing view that German success relied on overwhelming numerical superiority was certainly true in the case of the campaign against Poland, which began on September 1, 1939, when the 1,500 ﬁrst-line aircraft of the German air force overwhelmed the 397 aircraft used by the Poles. But against Britain and France, who declared war against Germany on September 3, 1939, the balance of air resources was more even, with 2,741 ﬁrst-line German combat aircraft (including 1,180 bombers and 970 single-seat ﬁghters) pitted against more than 2,000 British and French ﬁrst-line planes. The Western Allies also had much higher reserves, though of less advanced design. 6The rapid success of German armies in the campaigns against the Netherlands, Belgium, and France was achieved largely thanks to German air superiority. The twenty-seven hundred aircraft assigned to the task by the German high command were all concentrated on the single aim of supporting the ground armies, which they did by a mixture of reconnaissance ﬂights, ﬁghter-to-ﬁghter contests for air superiority, dive-bombing attacks on enemy strongpoints, and medium-bomber attacks on more distant targets of opportunity behind the enemy front line. They were organized in integrated air ﬂeets, employing different types of aircraft but with centralized control, high mobility, and effective radio communication. The bulk of British aircraft, however, remained in Britain to defend against a possible German air assault, while French aircraft were distributed around mainland France and in North Africa to protect the more dispersed French war production and guard against the possibility of Italian intervention. 7The Western EBSCOhost - printed on 10/12/2024 9:39 AM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.
