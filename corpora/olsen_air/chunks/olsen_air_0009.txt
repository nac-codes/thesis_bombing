September 5. From September 7 on, continued and heavy daylight attacks were mounted against the British capital. They proved a disaster for the German air force because Fighter Command had not been eliminated. A high toll was taken of enemy bombers, even though a great many delivered their bomb load as directed. The attacks forced German ﬁghters to engage in air combat at the very limit of their range, while the bombers were easy prey for the faster and heavily gunned British ﬁghters. By the time the campaign petered out at the beginning of October, the German air force had lost 1,733 aircraft versus 915 for the RAF . Bythis time, Hitler had decided to postpone Sealion indeﬁnitely. All preparations were scaled down after September 19. The failure to secure air supremacy was a central explanation for this decision, though not the only one. Despite extensive preparations and training, the German navy could not guarantee the success of a difﬁcult cross-channel operation that would be under attack from British naval forces and by RAFBomber Command. 13 The third phase of the air assault on Britain was an attempt by the German air force to mount an independent strategic campaign to use demoralizing attacks on trade, shipping, industrial production, and communications to force Britain out of the war. This approach represented not only a clear break with German objectives of the summer and autumn of 1940, but also the onset of a campaign for which the air force had not been prepared. Moreover, there were no clearly deﬁned objectives beyond the hope that Britain might sue for peace while German forces prepared for the campaign against the Soviet Union, ﬁnally decided by Hitler in November 1940 and authorized in the “Barbarossa” Directive 21 of December 18. The new air strategy unfolded incrementally.
