few of them before beginning its own operations). The high losses from daylight raids forced the German air force to shift to night bombing, as the RAF had already done earlier in 1940. Losses from antiaircraft ﬁre and the ﬁrst nightﬁghter squadrons of the RAF were small in relation to the effort made, but German success rested on effective navigation, an advantage sustained until British scientiﬁc intelligence experts correctly interpreted the nature of the electronic beams and devised countermeasures in November 1940. This began a four-year electronic battle between the two sides to keep one step ahead in navigational and radar technology, an early ancestor of the electronic battleﬁelds of the late twentieth and early twenty-ﬁrst centuries. 20The campaign also revealed the importance of carrying a mixed armament, combining high-explosive with incendiary bombs, as well as aerial mines, which had a powerful destructive effect; 4,729 of them were dropped between September 1940 and May 1941. The proportion of incendiaries used rose over the course of the attacks: between September and December 1940, incendiaries made up 6.2 percent of the bomb tonnage dropped; between January and May 1941, they made up 12.8 percent. 21 A number of factors limited what the Blitz could achieve. In the ﬁrst place, there was no clear pattern to the attacks, except for the continued assault on Britishtrade and dock areas, which was designed to complement the growing submarine campaign. The absence of clear strategic objectives betrayed the improvised nature of the campaign and the political motives that sustained it. In addition, the operations were inhibited not only by poor weather but also by the relatively small bomb loads that the standard medium bombers—the Heinkel He–111, Dornier Do–17, and Junkers Ju–88—were capable of carrying. The He–111, with the largest bomb lift, could carry 5,512 pounds over a short range, but the later RAF Avro Lancastercould carry 22,000 pounds, and the U.
