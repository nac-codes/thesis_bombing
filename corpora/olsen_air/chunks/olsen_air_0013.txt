, and Junkers Ju–88—were capable of carrying. The He–111, with the largest bomb lift, could carry 5,512 pounds over a short range, but the later RAF Avro Lancastercould carry 22,000 pounds, and the U.S. Boeing B–17E more than 20,000 pounds. Between September 1940 and May 1941, the German air force dropped 45,969 tons of bombs on British targets. Prewar extrapolations had suggested that the Britishwould ﬁnd bombing on such a scale insupportable, but the damage was restricted in scope outside London and the major dock cities and had a limited effect on war potential. The level of casualties was high, partly because air raid precautions were not extensive enough (few deep shelters had been constructed), and partly because of the concentrations of population in the vicinity of the major dock areas in London, Liver-pool, Southampton, Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Bristol. The toll of 41,987 dead and 49,405 injured over eight months represented a higher level of casualty per ton dropped than the RAF was able to inﬂict in the ﬁrst year of attacks on German targets. 22 EBSCOhost - printed on 10/12/2024 9:39 AM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

Although there was evidence of panic, increased criminality, and defeatism in all bombed areas, urban populations did not collapse in the face of attack, despite the fact that the British had never experienced such high civilian casualties and massive urban destruction in modern history. It is open to debate whether a longer offensive might have eventually provoked a more serious social and political crisis, but by the time the Blitz ended, British air raid precautions and antiaircraft defenses were substantially improved from the opening of the bombing campaign, while much of the threatened population had been evacuated from t
