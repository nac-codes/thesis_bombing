tz ended, British air raid precautions and antiaircraft defenses were substantially improved from the opening of the bombing campaign, while much of the threatened population had been evacuated from the major cities. 23 THE AIR WAR AT SEA The RAF and the Royal Navy shared duties in the air war at sea, and it was fought in the English Channel, over the Atlantic, and throughout the Mediterranean basin over a four-year period. From early 1942 onward, it was also fought by the U.S.Navy against the German submarines and by shore-based army aircraft in North Africa. The antisubmarine campaign involved aircraft in a number of different roles. RAF Coastal Command conducted regular patrols through the English Channel and over submarine approach routes to the French Atlantic ports; the heavy bombers of Bomber Command pounded the submarine pens and German submarine produc-tion, though in both cases with slight effect; Royal Navy aircraft attacked Italian shipping in the Mediterranean and gave increasing levels of protection to shipping convoys in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean from ﬂeet carriers or small escort carriers; RAF forces in North Africa bombed Axis shipping and ports or conducted patrols against enemy submarines. In all naval theaters, it took time to develop the forces and the necessary degree of collaboration between the services to achieve signiﬁcant results. In the Mediterranean, over two-thirds of Italy’s merchant marine was eventually sunk, with 37 percent of the losses attributed to aircraft. 24The effect was to cripple Axis operations in North Africa by 1942 and to open the way to complete victory there in May 1943. The Italian air force, originally organized for offensive operations in the Med- iterranean theater, was composed predominantly of obsolescent aircraft and was too small to challenge Allied air power effectively. The number of combat aircraft available to the Italian air force declined from 1,780 in June 1940, when Italy declared war on Brita
