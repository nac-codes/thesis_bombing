ircraft and was too small to challenge Allied air power effectively. The number of combat aircraft available to the Italian air force declined from 1,780 in June 1940, when Italy declared war on Britain and the Commonwealth, to 1,493 in December 1941 and 860 in November 1942. When Italy surrendered in September 1943, there were only approximately two hundred modern aircraft left. 25 The situation in the Atlantic became more dangerous once the submarine campaign reached its height.

Much of the damage to shipping was inﬂicted in the so-called Atlantic Gap beyond the range of existing long-range patrolling aircraft. The German navy attempt to get large vessels into the Atlantic to act as “merchant-raiders” in collaboration with submarines failed in 1941 with the sinking of the Bismarck, crippled by Royal Navy aircraft, while the early success of German long-range aircraft against shipping, particularly the Focke-Wulf 200 Kondor, was blunted by more active British air defense of the shipping lanes. 26 The introduction of aircraft into the antisubmarine war suffered from the failure of both interservice and inter-Allied collaboration. In the United States, the U.S.Army Air Forces (USAAF), created in June 1941, wanted to control the operation of long-range bomber aircraft over the Atlantic and in spring 1942 formed the USAAFAnti-Submarine Command, denying command or control to the U.S. Navy. Onlyin June 1942 did the Army chief of staff, General George Marshall, insist that 187 long-range B–24 Liberators be released for the use of the Navy, which had already begun a program of escort-carrier construction so that aircraft could accompany the convoys directly. 27 In Britain, the
