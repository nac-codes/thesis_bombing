Although the introduction of very-long-range aircraft did ensure that the German submarines could not easily return to the Atlantic, the battle was won before they were widely introduced. It is nevertheless evident that the battle could have been won sooner and at lower cost if the air effort had been properly appreciated and the resources made available.

Soviet air forces were organized not in air ﬂeets but in units assigned to particular frontline army groups,
