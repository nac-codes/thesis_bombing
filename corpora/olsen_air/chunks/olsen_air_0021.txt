, far from major supply centers. The improvements in maintenance also relied on a new system of air bases, with small, often improvised ﬁelds near the front and a series of larger and better resourced bases at safer distances (forty to sixty kilometers) from the front line. By force of circumstance, the Soviet armed forces constructed a ﬂexible oper- ational air force that was used to maximize the impact of the large ground armies in the major offensives conducted from 1943 onward. Aircraft were used principally to achieve temporary air superiority over the battleﬁeld area through strikes against enemy airﬁelds and ﬁghter aircraft and secondly to provide massive aerial ﬁrepower in tactical attacks on or near the battlefront—the form of operational air warfare exploited by the German air force in 1939–1941. The ﬁrst point at which these operational and command reforms were used with great effect was at Stalingrad,where Novikov organized an aerial blockade combining regular ﬁghter interception of enemy combat and transport aircraft with heavy tactical bombing attacks on German airﬁelds and troop concentrations. German Air Fleet Four was decimated during the siege at Stalingrad, with 488 aircraft destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Of the 624 aircraft remaining on the German southern front in Russia, only 240 were operational when Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus surrendered on January 31, 1943. The German effort to supply the Sixth Army from the air had also cost the German transport arm dearly: 266 Junkers Ju–52 transport aircraft were lost, one-third of the force, while a further 222 bombers converted to a transport role were also destroyed. 38 For the German air force in the East, the size of the front and the failure to expand aircraft production to match the scale of its demands made it difﬁcult to maintain an effective operational air war. Although German pilots occasionally were able to win local air superiority when there were sufﬁcient numbers of combat-worthy
