ts demands made it difﬁcult to maintain an effective operational air war. Although German pilots occasionally were able to win local air superiority when there were sufﬁcient numbers of combat-worthy aircraft, most German aviation had to concentrate on supporting ground forces in the long retreat back to Germany in 1943–1945.

During the summer of 1943, the Red air force was able to deploy up to ten thousand frontline aircraft; the German air force had thirty-ﬁve hundred combat-ready aircraft on all fronts in the summer of 1943, but only eighteen hundred to two thousand on the entire Easternfront—including just six hundred ﬁghter aircraft, most of which were deployed in unequal combat over the battleﬁeld at Kursk in July 1943. In the opening phase of this battle, the German air force had only 700 ﬁghters and ﬁghter-bombers against 2,170 for the Red air force, which could also draw on substantial reserves positioned close behind the battle. In July and August, the German air ﬂeets lost 1,272 aircraft around Kursk and in the retreat that followed. This high loss rate was largely owing to the inability of attenuated German air forces to prevent the enemy from operating heavy attacks against air bases and supply or from using its larger number of ﬁghters to maintain local air superiority. 39 The operational ﬂexibility and concentration of force characteristic of the early years of German victories were lost in the face of a vastly larger force and high levels of force attrition. As a result of German weakness, Soviet loss rates fell from 34 percent of combat aircraft in 1942 to 14 percent in 1944, even though poor handling and training still resulted in very high noncombat losses.
