esult of German weakness, Soviet loss rates fell from 34 percent of combat aircraft in 1942 to 14 percent in 1944, even though poor handling and training still resulted in very high noncombat losses. 40 Falling loss rates and high production meant that by January 1944, the Red air force had 13,500 combat aircraft; a year later, 15,500. The ﬁnal major offensives into Central Europe involved army groups supported by up to eight thousand aircraft. 41By that stage, additional German aircraft production (which reached 39,807 in 1944) was sucked into the major battles in the West and the defense of the Reich from bomb attack. THE AIR WAR IN WESTERN EUROPE The circumstances of war also contributed to the RAF’s choice of air strategy from 1941 onward. But unlike the German experience, these circumstances compelled Britain to adopt an operationally diverse strategy while encouraging commitment of a large proportion of the British and Commonwealth war effort to aircraft production, pilot training, and air operations. The impossibility of launching a major land offensive on the Continent without major allies predisposed the Britishmilitary leadership to adopt a strategy of long-range bombing against Axis military and economic targets and, indirectly, against the enemy’s will to ﬁght. The necessity of keeping open sea-lanes in the Atlantic and Mediterranean compelled greater attention to air power and the war at sea. The defense of Egypt against Italo-German attacks in 1941–1942 forced the RAF to learn to ﬁght the kind of operational air war in support of ground offensives developed by the German air force (and sub- EBSCOhost - printed on 10/12/2024 9:39 AM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.
