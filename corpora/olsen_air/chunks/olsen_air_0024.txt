THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE , 1939–1945 41 sequently imitated by all of Germany’s major enemies). At the same time, the air defense of Britain was strengthened to ensure that if Germany won the war against the Soviet Union, renewed air attacks on Britain could be met by a more effective shield than had been available in 1940–1941. In the middle years of the war, the exercise of air power became the essential component of British strategy, as it was for U.S. forces arriving in Europe in 1942 following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harboron December 7, 1941, and the German and Italian declaration of war on the United States four days later. As in the air war at sea, there were also issues of service politics and inter-Allied collaboration to address in the development of an effective operational air power against Axis forces in North Africa in 1941–1943, in Italy during the invasion of 1943–1945, and in the campaign across France in 1944. During the desert campaigns of 1941–1942, the RAF and the Commonwealth air forces generally enjoyed numer-ical superiority over the combined Italian and German air forces but found it difﬁcult to make that difference effective at the operational level. The British armies in North Africa expected close protection for their forces and would have preferred tactical control of air forces by the ground army. The RAF in the Middle East wanted to retain independence from the ground commanders but needed to establish a clear doctrine governing the way air operations could best serve the central strategic objective. This doctrine was worked out under the leadership of Air Marshal Arthur Tedder, commander in chief of RAF Middle East Command, one of the few senior airmen who understood the importance of winning air superiority rather than simply bombing the enemy. The new doctrine, like the reform instituted in the Soviet air force in 1942, relied on imitating German practice. Fighter squadrons were to be used to eliminate enemy air power and attack
