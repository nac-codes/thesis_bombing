rs (the aircraft the RAF crucially lacked for much of the early period of the war). The American P–38 Lightning and P–47 Thunderbolt and the British Hawker Typhoon were all capable of carrying rockets and bombs for attacks on battleﬁeld targets. Recent research has suggested that their role as “tank-busting” aircraft has been exaggerated, but the psychological impact on ground forces that were almost wholly without effective air support was profound. 44 Almost all the senior German generals interrogated about the cause of the Allied victory in the West held the view that air power had been decisive. Hitler’s chief of operations, Colonel General Alfred Jodl, told his American interrogator late in June 1945, “I would say in general that in the end the winning of complete EBSCOhost - printed on 10/12/2024 9:39 AM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

These independent air campaigns, critical elements in Western air strategy, were sometimes constrained by, but never entirely subordinate to, the operations of the rest of the armed forces. Although both the British and the Americans viewed bombing as a campaign that could fatally weaken Axis forces at the front by sapping the supply of munitions, the assumption was that an enemy nation would be more likely to succumb if the armed forces in the ﬁeld were simply bypassed and the “vital centers”—the eco
