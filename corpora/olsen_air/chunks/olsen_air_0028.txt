e front by sapping the supply of munitions, the assumption was that an enemy nation would be more likely to succumb if the armed forces in the ﬁeld were simply bypassed and the “vital centers”—the economic and military structures on the home front and the morale of the enemy population—struck instead. These views were fully developed in both air forces before 1939, and they rested on an assumption that the next war would be a total war in which the whole of the enemy state would be involved and therefore could legitimately be disabled. 47 In both cases, the aim was not to inﬂict indiscriminate destruction and killing but rather to ﬁnd those objects or areas in an enemy’s industrial and economic structure most susceptible to debilitating interruption. However, it was never intended that such attacks would not also have a profound social and political effect and weaken enemy resistance, perhaps to the point of collapse. 48 When both bomber forces began to plan seriously for a future campaign, they tried to identify which target systems would be most likely to yield rapid and signiﬁcant dividends. The British Western Air Plans, drawn up in December 1937, identiﬁed attacks on production in the German Ruhr industrial region as vital and added attacks on other industrial areas, the capital city of Berlin, and German docks and trade. 49Other target systems—oil, aircraft production, machinery, chemicals, and the power industry—were added by 1939. When U.S. Air Intelligence was asked to draft the air component of the Victory program drawn up in the summer of 1941 on President Franklin Roosevelt’s orders, the group under Colonel Harold George identiﬁed a web of key industries and services whose disruption would fatally undermine the German war effort. Air War Plans Division Plan 1 (AWPD–1) listed nine core areas, including transport, aircraft industries, electricity generation, and chemicals; a further list produced on the orders EBSCOhost - printed on 10/12/2024 9:39 AM via
