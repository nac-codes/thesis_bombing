Not only did no other major air force place such reliance on the impact of independent bombing, but the high aspirations of prewar planning were also shown to be almost entirely unrealistic. It was never possible to disrupt individual target sys-tems completely, and it took so long to effect massive damage on German society that the country was invaded and occupied by ground armies while the bombers con-tinued to hammer away at German cities. In the process, around 410,000 German civilians and between 60,000 to 70,000 foreign forced laborers, camp prisoners, and POWs were killed—an outcome that was never planned for since bombing was expected to yield much faster dividends. The two bomber forces also killed an estimated sixty thousand Italian civilians and sixty thousand to seventy thousand French, most of them as a result of efforts to liberate them from German rule between 1943 and 1945. 51These paradoxes have helped to fuel the popular postwar perception that bombing was a wasted strategic effort and that the heavy cost to the German, Italian, and French populations was ethically insupportable. 52 Of course, none of these outcomes could have been known with any certainty at the start of the campaigns, since almost no hard evidence was available that bombing had, or would have in the future, the effects described in the strategy. The evidence of the popular reaction to the Blitz and the limited damage that nine mont
