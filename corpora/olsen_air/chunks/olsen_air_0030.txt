The evidence of the popular reaction to the Blitz and the limited damage that nine months of bombing did to Britain’s productive war effort failed to undermine the expectations of the RAF or the political leadership about probable results. This was partly because the bombing campaigns were promoted not necessarily to produce clearly understood strategic goals but sometimes to serve political ends. Both Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt played a central part in promoting and supporting the bombing campaigns and in allocating the generous productive capacity needed to sustain them. When Churchill became prime minister on May 10, 1940, the RAF was still restricted by a general ban introduced by Neville Chamberlain’s government in 1939 that stated that no air attacks should be undertaken that risked inﬂicting civilian casualties.
