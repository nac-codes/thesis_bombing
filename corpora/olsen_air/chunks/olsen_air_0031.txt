aft production, that only “an absolutely devastating, exterminating attack by very heavy bombers” would bring about Hitler’s downfall. 54 At all the major points in 1940 and 1941 where decisions had to be made about bombing strategy, Churchill played an approving part, encouraged by his chief scientiﬁc adviser, Lord Cherwell. In July 1941, Churchill requested the RAF commander in chief to undertake the “devastation of German cities”; on July 9, Bomber Command was directed explicitly to attack urban industrial targets as a whole on nights when precise targets were not visible. 55 For Churchill, and later for Roosevelt, there were also wider strategic consider- ations. It was considered important that Britain could demonstrate to the Empire, to the United States, and to occupied Europe that she was still a willing participant in the war; and in 1940, it was also important to sustain domestic war-willingness by the same route. 56 In July 1941, Churchill’s enthusiasm for the indiscriminate bombing of Germany had to be set against his desire to show Stalin that Britain was keen to assist the Soviet war effort, and the same argument was used at the Moscow Conference with Stalin in mid-August 1942: that bombing could be regarded as a surrogate for a second front. For Roosevelt, who shared Churchill’s enthusiasm for a bombing strategy and who in the 1930s had helped to overcome Army hostility to a heavy-bomber program, the bombing campaign in Europe was also a way to show that the United States was serious about the war and to convince the home population, whose gaze was ﬁxed on the harsh struggles in the South Paciﬁc, that the war in Europe was a priority. When there was growing criticism of the slow progress of American attacks against Germany in late 1942, the Eighth Air Force commander, Major General Carl Spaatz,was redeployed to the Mediterranean and replaced by the commander of EighthBomber Command, Major General Ira Eaker. It was also hoped that bombing might indeed
