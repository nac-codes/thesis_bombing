The RAF launched the Battle of Berlin in the autumn of 1943, but loss rates rose to 14 percent of the attacking force destroyed or seriously damaged. The last raid, on March 24, 1944, cost 10 percent of the force destroyed, and a further raid on Nuremberg on March 30 saw the destruction of 11 percent. Harris admitted to the Air Ministry in London that these loss rates could not be sustained for long. The U.S. Eighth Air Force also suffered debilitating losses in the autumn of 1943, most famously during a raid on October 14, 1943, against the ball-bearing plants at Schweinfurt, which cost 60 bombers destroyed and 138 damaged out of a force of 300. 66The USAAF then suspended further deep raids into Germany. The solution was to ﬁnd ways of contesting German air forces over German territory, the problem that had faced the German air force over Britain in 1940. During the winter of 1943–1944, the Eighth Air Force planned a concentrated assault on German aircraft production (Operation Argument), which took place in the weeks starting February 20, 1944. The 3,800 bombers of the U.S. Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces and 2,351 RAF bombers dropped 20,000 tons of munitions on the German aircraft production sector, delaying two months of ﬁghter production and forcing the dispersal of much German production underground or to more distant sites. The most signiﬁcant aspect of the operation was the use of large numbers of long-range ﬁghter aircraft converted for the purpose of contesting German air superiority in German airspace. The search for a means of bringing direct pressure on the German defense force began in
