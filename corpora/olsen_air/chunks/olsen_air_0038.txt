The neutralization of the German air force opened the way for the remorseless destruction of much of urban Germany and its communications, fuel supply, and infrastructure from the summer of 1944 onward. Historians have recently demonstrated that during the latter stages of the war, American bombers engaged increasingly in blind bombing through clouds and haze, achieving in effect a form of area bombing not very different from that of RAF Bomber Command. Between September and December 1944, 52.9 percent of bomb tonnage was delivered by blind bombing. 68 The effects of the bombing campaign have been widely debated. A recent study has suggested that the last stages of the campaign yielded what economists calldiminishing returns—that the cost of the campaign in its last year produced a proportionately smaller effect per bomb dropped than earlier in the war. There is little argument that the ﬁnal stages of the bombing war, including the destruction of Dresden on February 13–14, 1945, did represent a form of “overkill” with few direct strategic beneﬁts and an excessive level of casualty for an increasingly defenseless civilian population. 69There has also been much argument over whether German war production was seriously affected, since in 1944 German industry produced three times as many weapons as in 1941. The question is really one of what might have been. Here there are two central considerations. First, the German war economy from 1942 onward was capable of producing a great deal more than it did. The physical damage to plants, forced dispersal, the loss of hours caused by air raid alarms, and the diversion of more than 2 million people, 55,000 antiaircraft guns, 20 percent of all ammunition, and extensive electrical, optical, and radar production to the defense effort inhibited substantially what the German economy, if entirely free of bombing, might have been capable of producing. 70 Second, the bombing offensives distorted German air strategy entirely and under-
