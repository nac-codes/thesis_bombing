or the moment consider: ideally it vindicates Burke's theory of representative government-which, says Lord Acton, "laid down for ever the law of the relations be- tween members and constituencies, which is the innermost barrier against the reign of democratic force." 2 The elected person, as all save those of the extreme left and right would now agree, repre- sents not the interest of a particular section but that of the com- monweal: "You choose a member, indeed, but when you have chosen him he is not a member of Bristol, but he is a member of Parliament." 3 What he owes his constituents is not obedience to their mandates-or, as it works in practice, the mandates of a mere majority of them-but the exercise of his independent industry and judgment in the interest of the whole nation.

Burke lifted the idea of organization to a higher level, gave it deeper foundations, stuck to it at a tragic price. Pol
