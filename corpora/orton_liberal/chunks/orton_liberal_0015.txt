the word carried much of the opprobrium that the word "lob- bies" bears for us. Burke lifted the idea of organization to a higher level, gave it deeper foundations, stuck to it at a tragic price. Polit- ical principle, he held, was a valid and necessary basis for effective action; and "party is a body of men united, for promoting by their joint endeavours the national interest, upon some particular prin- ciple in which they are all agreed." 4 It was in that sense that the party system became, in modern England, as good a solution for the problem of freedom under law as the world had yet devised. But its success depended upon certain imperative conditions. The unity Burke had in mind must, if it were to bind honest and intelligent men, be pretty deeply grounded; and their conception of the national interest must transcend mere sectional or ephem- eral ends. Moreover, since the system envisaged the possibility of more than one such party, it tacitly assumed a still deeper unity underlying all. Upon that supreme loyalty, that ultimate alle- giance-never perhaps to be perfectly defined-both the stability and the flexibility of the system would in fact depend. Whether, or how far, these conditions obtain in contemporary politics it will be one of our major tasks to enquire. Burke described his ideal politician as the philosopher in action. But it was no academic philosophy he had in mind. "All virtue which is unpracticable is spurious," he said bluntly. His analysis of the nature of public life is the more significant in that it arose from strenuous practical experience, in a difficult and confused era shot through with more than the usual amount of corruption. The emphasis with which he states his conclusions has the note of courage as well as conviction: "The greater part of the measures 4.
