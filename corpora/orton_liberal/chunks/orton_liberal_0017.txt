Ideas have a radiation and develop- ment, an ancestry and posterity of their own, in which men play the part of godfathers and godmothers rather than of legitimate parents." 6 "Party," he adds, echoing Burke, "is not only, not so much, a group of men as a set of ideas and ideal aims." 7 Acton did not mean that to be taken in a Platonic sense: he found too much reality in the world of human events to permit his soaring 5.

For him the interaction of general idea and particular circumstance is the very stuff of his- tory, the plane on which the significance of the human struggle really lies; his genius consists in his being so uniquely at home on that plane. For example, he says of his predecessor at Cambridge, Sir John Seeley: "He discerns no Whiggism but only Whigs. And my great complaint is that he so much dislikes the intriguers of 1688 that he does not recognize the doctrine of 1688, which is one of the greatest forces, one of the three or four greatest forces, that have contributed to construct our civilization." 8 On the other hand, his verdict on the men of 1789 is that they sacrificed the actual human values of their cause to the tyranny of an abstract idea. While Burke and Acton agree in their understanding of the nature of political action, the
