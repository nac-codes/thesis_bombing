Not all conservatives would acknowledge all these tenets, and liberalism is certainly not opposed to them in toto; the first six, and the last, would command the assent of most liberals in some degree, and some liberals would assent-in some degree-to the whole series. But the liberal starting point is different. Fear of change is certainly not a basic liberal attitude. Liberalism is much more optimistic about the possibilities of beneficent change, and the capacity of rational minds to achieve it; and, we must add, liberalism is by no means convinced of the intrinsic value of much that conservatism seeks to conserve.
