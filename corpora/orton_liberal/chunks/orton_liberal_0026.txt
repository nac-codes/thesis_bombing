To ensure that man the contriver is man the life bringer rather than man the destroyer is the specific task of liberalism.

Even yet he is reluctant to admit that the case is not so: despite the fact that the advance of material culture is threatening to tear to pieces even such enclaves of true com- munity as have slowly and painfully been brought into being. The kind of intellect that has organized and achieved-to its great credit-the triumph of technique is radically different from the kind of intelligence that is required to create and foster a com- munity of human living.
