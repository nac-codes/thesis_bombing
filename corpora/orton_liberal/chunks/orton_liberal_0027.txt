In the mass adulation of the material culture and of the men who could control or manip- ulate it, other requirements of social health, and the most patent symptoms that all was not well, were recklessly disregarded; and certain urges were released, and others encouraged, that made the development of true human community progressively more dif- ficult With such recognitions emerges the characteristic dilemma of the liberal.

Defined ends, in so large a sense, are apt to be either arbitrary or meaningless; and in any case, they make no satis- factory fusion with the patient empiricism which is the essence of the liberal method. All utopias and most blueprints, including that of the late League of Nations, have an intrinsic static quality, which necessarily increases as their authors attempt to provide for every conceivable contingency of an extremely contingent universe. For the forces that play upon the lives of men-from within as well as from without-are so much vaster than what the contriving intellect can catalogue that the schemers and planners, throughout all history, have been condemned to spend most of their time in futile explanation of the perversity with which the course of events has made fools of them.
