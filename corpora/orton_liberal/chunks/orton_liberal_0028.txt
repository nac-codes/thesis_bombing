octors, with many centuries of experience behind them, have learnt to be cautious in predict- ing what the body will do in given circumstances; but because they are cautious, and rely on experience, they are increasingly successful in their limited sphere. Global strategists and politi- cians might take a lesson from them, if humility were part of their equipment; for when it is said that the meek shall inherit the earth, the gospel word means really the teachable, those who are not so LIBERALISM AND CONSERVATISM 19 puffed up with their own omniscience as to be past learning.
