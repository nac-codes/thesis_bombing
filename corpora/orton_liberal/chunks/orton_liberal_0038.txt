miserable, there is obviously a lot more to be said. But "to call happiness the chief good is a mere truism, and what is wanted is some clearer account of its real nature." There speaks the essential Aristotle; for what he means by "real nature" is not what abstract speculation may deduce but what careful observation may detect. The difference is fundamental. Once you start working backward from abstractly conceived ends to the policies and problems of actuality, there is no telling to what enormities your logic may drive you. Rationalism of the a priori type always ends by being inhumane and antidemocratic, because it can see nothing in the folkways and traditions of ordinary peo- ple except obscurantism. They get in the way of the ideal scheme, and that becomes a sufficient excuse for impersonal harshness and well-intentioned brutality. Plato is the classical illustration. Venera- tion for his poetic and literary genius has blinded generations of students to the practical tendency of his political approach. The Plato of the dialogues might today have been writing for The New Yorker: but the Plato of The Laws would have been chairman of the late Dies Committee. The plain fact is that The Republic, in its political and social implications, is one of the most horrible books ever written. Scholars apologize for this aspect of it by arguing that it was not meant to apply to any actual society (a somewhat doubtful plea ); but even after he had tried his hand at an actual society, the rationalist in Plato was too strong for the human being. As Aristotle duly noted against him, his logic inevitably led to a government, not of laws, but of men (the wisest men, of course: they always are); and in the tenth book of The Laws Plato again endows those men with the most stringent censorship, with powers of ostracism and imprisonment for unorthodoxy, and finally with the death penalty for heresy. There is, one fears, something in- herently attractive about this sort of thing to
