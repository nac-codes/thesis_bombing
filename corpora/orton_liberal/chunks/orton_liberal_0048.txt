that "some are slaves by nature." But within the limits generally accepted in the ancient world, the Greeks succeeded in laying down for all time certain political conditions of freedom: two in particular. First, they realized that no game is worth playing if the rules can be changed without notice; that was their main debating point against the Persians. From Herodotus on, Greek literature con- stantly emphasizes the disadvantages of despotism from the ra- tional point of view. No man can be really free if there is no means of knowing what is going to happen next, if the rules of society may be unpredictably different next week from what they were last.

There lay the difficulty in taking over, or making over, the Jewish concept of a father-god with its Oriental reference; whether the difficulty has ever been solved is perhaps open to question.
