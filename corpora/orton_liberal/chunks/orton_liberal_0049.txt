It is a good thing for any body politic to include a recognized group with a recognized philosophy that is prepared to challenge change. If shopkeeping millionaires subsidize radical propaganda then it is equally legitimate for property-holding mil- lionaires to subsidize conservative propaganda. To flatter the masses by indiscriminate abuse of conservatism and all its ex- ponents is no true service to liberalism. But having said so much, we must recognize the special diffi- culties introduced by the economic factor-just as the Greeks had THE CLASSICAL FOUNDATIONS 35 to. As city life developed, the influence of private wealth became more and more of a problem.
