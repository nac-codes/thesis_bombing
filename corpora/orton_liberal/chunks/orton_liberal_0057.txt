one left anywhere now. De- velopment or retrogression is the rule. In the successful cases the area of human cooperation grows in- tensively and extensively, and as it does so men become more fully aware of it and have to think more deeply about it. For the rules THE CHRISTIAN SYNTHESIS 41 change too. Law, or whatever passes for law, has to be made more explicit, modified or added to. Interests conflict; and where genu- ine community exists-that is, where people really want to settle their differences without injuring one another-some criterion for the changing of the rules becomes necessary. The problem of the source or foundation of law emerges and gives rise to very sig- nificant thought. The concept of a law behind the law now finds expression: the notion of an authority in reserve as it were, some- thing higher or deeper than explicit positive law, by which that law itself is to be evaluated, by which its development and altera- tion ought to be guided. The primitive habit is to seek this authority in the words of some eponymous hero or tribal deity, remembered or engraved on tablets of stone or gold or inscribed in a magic book; or in mys- terious communications to selected and awesomely environed dev- otees. All such things have of course to be interpreted in specific - terms, and they generally give rise therefore to some sort of caste or hierarchy, usually tyrannical because there is no possible ap- peal from it. Nonetheless, a good deal of profound and disinter- ested thought might go into that sort of hieratic utterance, as it certainly did among the augurs and soothsayers of old, the priests and priestesses of the oracles, or the bibliolaters of Vedantic, Jew- ish, Mahommedan, or Puritan society. But in more advanced com- munities, where thought is free, we find a consistent and steadily developing line of approach to the problem of the law behind the law. Consider the notion so familiar to every American in its formu- lation of the rights of man and th
