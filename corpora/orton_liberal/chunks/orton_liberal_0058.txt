find a consistent and steadily developing line of approach to the problem of the law behind the law. Consider the notion so familiar to every American in its formu- lation of the rights of man and the principles of the Declaration of Independence: the concept of rights prior to law-that is, both antecedent to, and superior to, all positive enactment. The notion was thoroughly familiar to the Greeks: we find it even in Homer. President Franklin D.

Rights properly so called are assertions as to the nature, and particularly the limits, of secular power, rooted in the deepest sense of human personality. Aristotle is very definite about the distinction between positive law, which is necessarily local and conventional, and something more binding and universal-more catholic, as we should now say. Most Greek philosophers thought that if you looked for it-as the g
