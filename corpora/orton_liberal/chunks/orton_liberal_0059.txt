Most Greek philosophers thought that if you looked for it-as the greatest of them actually did- you would find everywhere a natural sense of right and wrong which was in fact as well as in theory the foundation of all par- ticular systems: "a certain natural and universal right and wrong, which all men divine, even if they have no intercourse or cove- nant with each other"; 1 or in the words of Empedocles, whom Aristotle quotes, "a universal law stretching without break through the wide domain of the sky, and through the vast earth too." The idea was taken up by the Roman jurists, and underwent a tre- mendous development in Cicero and the Stoics. The circumstances in which Roman law had to be applied gave it a powerful impetus. For as the Roman rule expanded, the old civil law-the law of the citizens-no longer sufficed to govern the relations of so many tribes and territories of noncitizens.

But long before that policy was consummated, a complementary legal system had grown up: not so much in the theorizing of the law schools as in the actual workaday business of administration.
