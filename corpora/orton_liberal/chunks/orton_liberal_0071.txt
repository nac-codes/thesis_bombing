Socrates drink the hemlock or Christ carry the cross: on the contrary, it was the very uniqueness of those actions that established their sovereignty ver the minds and hearts of men. Paul then, going consciously to the root of the matter, cleaves a bold dichotomy between the primordial and the teleological with his doctrine of the dual na- Fire of man. Man as part of the natural order is but potentiality, earth bound, death doomed, sunk in the universal flux of things. But for man, and for man alone, to be no more than that is sin; be- cause he is called-and he knows it and has always known it, as the earliest records testify-to a "rebirth," to "walk in newness of life," in "the law of the spirit of life": the words are so familiar, the meaning so remote to our generation. Philosophy has never succeeded in defining the nature of man, and never will. Obviously, if my dog could define the nature of dog she would be more than dog to begin with; yet, being very elderly and wise, she not only knows a great deal about dog, she knows a good deal about me. This sort of knowing, of course, is the oldest and deepest kind: knowing in experience; it is what is referred to by that etymological root of immemorial antiquity, the k-n or g-n root that survives in words like cunning, conna√Ætre, king; it is what the English Bible means when it says "Adam knew Eve his wife," and again when it says, "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." This kind of knowing, which modern education systematically ignores, is not a matter of making sen- tences and syllogisms, it is all along a species of doing and experi- encing; and what its exponents say (the Church is not the only one) is that by living according to a certain pattern, a man may attain practical wisdom and spiritual freedom. Of course, there are ways that lead to destruction via practical folly and spiritual bond- age; and spiritual freedom is not the whole story; but it is surely the essential beginning, for me
