freedom. Of course, there are ways that lead to destruction via practical folly and spiritual bond- age; and spiritual freedom is not the whole story; but it is surely the essential beginning, for men who are not spiritually free can hardly be relied on to create a free society. We can reach the same conclusion by another tack. Scientists can define the nature of inert and much of organic life; when they do so, they talk in functional terms-they tell us what under a variety of circumstances things will do. They are not interested in the problem of what things are; that question, if it has any meaning (which is very doubtful), belongs to the province of meta- physics; the nearest the scientists come to it is in their amazing  52 THE CHRISTIAN SYNTHESIS THE LIBERAL TRADITION assemblage of functional equations. Similarly, when we try to say anything significant about human beings, we find ourselves talk- ing in functional terms; even psychology, in its endless attempt to define its own subject matter, has hit on the functional basis. With- out function no definition amounts to much. You can say, if you like, that a violin is a particular arrangement of wood, catgut, and horsehair, but nobody will accept that for a definition; you cannot define a violin without saying what a violin is for. Violins are made by men, so men can do that. Men do not appear, however, to have made themselves; so as soon as they try to define their nature, thev find themselves using words that reach out beyond themselves that are thrown forward, as it were, along certain observed lines of direction; which is what the Church does when she says, in her characteristic way, Man is made in the image of God, man is a child of God. That is not definition, it is open-ended description, which tallies with the open-ended experience of actual living-the infinite hoping and striving, the love, the sacrifice, the conviction of mean- ing and value, as known to common people and great poets: not in the labor
