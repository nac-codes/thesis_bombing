what their Ã†rmations mean or what relation they bear to the facts of the Universe. If the essential thing about the Christian message was a new announce- ment of what God was, of what God had done and would do, the announcement could hardly be effective so long as Christians them- selves had quite confused ideas of what the words which they used implied.11 Because Christianity is a school of life as well as a school of thought; and because its central message is that "the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us"; the terms of its affirmations are frankly, and rightly, anthropomorphic: any terms you may use about such matters are going to be anthropomorphic, no matter how long are the words you employ. Dogmatic affirmation does not preclude an ever-deepening understanding of the terms employed; but it ensures, and is maintained to ensure, that the essence of Christian truth shall not- as can so easily happen-be dissipated and lost in the philosophic mists of a world without clarity or coherence. Cultural anthropologists have made a vast and fascinating col- lection of the forms assumed by the religious impulse in various societies, especially the more primitive; but the significance of this material has not increased in proportion to its quantity. Essen- tially, in its bearing on the development of Christianity, there is nothing new. Christians have always known that their cultus de- veloped more by assimilation and transformation of older forms than by conscious innovation-as it still does, and always will. Religious forms are not invented or deliberately contrived; cranks have often attempted that, but the results have been singularly infertile. Just as some English words of richest meaning have Sanskrit or even pre-Sanskrit roots, so the elements of religious expression have primordial origins: for instance, the association of height with sublimity and divinity, of light with knowledge and illumination, of wind with inspiration and power.12 Religious rites show so
