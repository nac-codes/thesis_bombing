But the older vision of unity had more than a theory to sustain it. From the seventh to the seventeenth century the thought and culture of the civilized world had an actual unity that is hard for us even to imagine. Our ears are filled with the nauseating plati- tude that the world has become smaller; but in things more im- portant than bombing planes and washing machines its distances are vaster than for a thousand years.
