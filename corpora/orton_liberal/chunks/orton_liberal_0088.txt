Among these, two main types are of especial significance to the liberal tradition. The first of these types is clearly indicated in Toynbee's state- ment that "a schism in the souls of human beings will be found at the heart of any schism that reveals itself on the surface of the society." 4 This is essentially the point of view of all idealist phi- losophers and historians (the adjective being taken here to in- dicate a simple antithesis to materialism) and it is the position to which liberalism naturally inclines.
