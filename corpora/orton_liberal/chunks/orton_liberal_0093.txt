And we are reminded of those Milanese "ragpickers" of yet a hundred years earlier, who stood up to the papal legates and made their case against the worldli- ness of the clergy and the corruption of the Church. Or we think of the homespun evangelism of Toulouse, PÃ©rigord, Languedoc, and Provence some of it influenced, no doubt, by alien heresy, but most of it indigenous, with its farmer preachers and its tough antisacerdotal bent.
