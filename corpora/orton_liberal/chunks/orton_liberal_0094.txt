th the passing of the years, we must remember also that new life is flowing into it, and through it, every moment-intellectual and spiritual life as well as bio- logical-in which respect, as Heraclitus saw, it probably resembles every other form that we perceive in the universe. This new life wells up from the mass of the people; and for the most part it as- sumes, naturally enough, the forms it itself has developed in the  THE LIBERAL TRADITION 68 course of the generations, following the main lines of articulation of thought and conduct by a process which is more instinctive than reflective. But there is always a tension in the forms, always a certain stress in their perennial assumption; and while the great historians of culture, such as Spengler, Toynbee, Sorokin, trace out their major fluctuations, it is well for us to remember this quivering evanescence in the day-to-day life of society, and the factors on which normal stability depends. For forms will be durable in proportion as they are true to the real physis of human nature; those which embody a more pro- found level of truth will persist while others change, and renew themselves if they are temporarily obscured. Thus certain re- ligious forms have outlasted every other social type, and may in some degree be eternal. But we must not think of them too pla- tonically, as existing in vacuo. Conscious intellect and curious ex- perience affect the transmittal, so that both innovation and error may have more or less lasting effects. Truth is not a dead thing, not like a stone-even if the stone be a diamond: it is a living appre- hension of reality, dwelling in the minds of living men; it can therefore be nurtured, and grow deeper, and it can be injured or neglected-with due consequences. The American stock market crash of 1929, for example, and the years of confusion that followed it, were directly related to the puerility of current American phi- losophy. Historians of culture, especially Catholic ones, have sho
