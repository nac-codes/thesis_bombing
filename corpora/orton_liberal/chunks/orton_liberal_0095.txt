sh of 1929, for example, and the years of confusion that followed it, were directly related to the puerility of current American phi- losophy. Historians of culture, especially Catholic ones, have shown how Christianity assimilated pagan forms and primitive faiths. we must now recognize that that process is not only a part of the past; it is going on all the time. For primitivism, with all its virtues and its limitations, is not merely a historical phenomenon; it is a normal element, a present condition of mind and culture, in every large society. It has its simple apprehensions of religious and po- litical truth, which are not sharply distinguished-notions of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man, an egalitarian sentiment arising straight out of the struggle to live, a tendency to search for a solution to the paradox of human destiny.
