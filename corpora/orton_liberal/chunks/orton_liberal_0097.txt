There is no doubt that this sort of motivation was strongly at work in the French Jacquerie of the fourteenth century, in John Ball and Wat Tyler, in the French Revolution and the Chartist movement. There can be little doubt that it underlies much of the labor and social unrest of the present day: the hair- trigger readiness to strike on trivial grounds, the race war in the United States, the latent violence that lies only just below the sur- face of that society-and all for the same reason: the decline of the integrative power of the central culture. We may notice here a factor that will presently demand fuller examination. The humane toleration of varying opinions, with liberty to organize and propagate, solves one problem at the price of raising another. For insofar as the activity of a number of widely differing schools tends to weaken the central tradition, the more sects there are-political or religious- the more there are likely to be. The history of the Third French Republic illustrates this process rather vividly; and without attempting as yet any solution to the dilemma, we may remark that universal tolerance by itself, is not the universal panacea it is popularly supposed to be. Primitivism as we have described it constitutes the raw material for yet another kind of problem. The amount of sheer goodness in it, its latent energy and aspiration, make it the happy hunting ground of every kind of evangelism (or almost every kind: the pretentious effort of the so-called "Oxford Movement" to eschew
