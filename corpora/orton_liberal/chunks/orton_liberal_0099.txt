III must wonder, in that situation, how far he could safely go without letting the enemy into the citadel. As we now see, it was not the only time such a situation was to arise. It was complicated, as such cases usually are, by the fact that both groups got mixed up in the play of power politics. So accus- tomed is the modern world to the complete separation of the tem- poral and spiritual powers that it can hardly envisage a differ- ent state of affairs. But that notion was slow in arising, and came as a novelty. And even after it had gained acceptance, with its famous metaphor of the two swords, the Church always had in reserve the superiority of the spiritual allegiance, so that it re- mained the right and the duty of the Vicar of Christ to admonish the temporal rulers. Nowadays the emphasis is all the other way, and modern potentates, in their broadcast praying, admonish the deity.

It was the undisputed duty of the Head of the Church to see that the work of the Church went on; and this involved, among other things, the maintenance of a vast organization with prelates and clergy possessed of extrater- ritorial rights and considerable economic privilege.
