nascent impulse toward Church reform, and the primitive piety that lay behind it, was inextricably involved therein. The Roman patarini of the twelfth century, for instance-who were probably heretical anyway-were being used by able people in their play against the temporal position of the papacy; and more important still, they became the focus of the really critical issue of the time. the demand for municipal autonomy. That gave them a positive position to rally about, such as, later on, territorial solidarity pro- vided for Protestantism in general. And the clue to the success of 11.

The thing occurred at a critical time; for at that very moment the English, led (as they like to think) by Shakespeare's Henry V, were laying about them on the soil of France-only to run into the inexplicable opposition of a girl called Joan. The significance of Joan's beatification, nearly five hundred years after they burned her vigorous young body, was rather lost on the English.

She was now in bliss-though whether it was the fag- gots of the English, the prayers of the faithful, or the politics of the Action Fran√ßaise that had got her there is perhaps a moot point. Her voices, after all, had
