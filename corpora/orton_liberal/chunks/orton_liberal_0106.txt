It was not at first an affair of individuals but of groups, corporations, and estates -including those "great estates" that came to be called nations. But in the nineteenth century it came increasingly to permeate individual life in all three spheres; and with the triumph of "indi- vidualism" it became evident that the outward wave had reached its limits. It could go no farther. A confused backwash set in, with the emancipated individuals clashing against the emancipated states, and the emancipated groups and states clashing violently with one another. Significantly, politicians began to talk in "global" terms, with a cramping apprehension at the back of their minds that the planet was too small. Unfortunately, the moon is a dead world, traditionally associated with lunacy. All this, we say, may in one sense be regarded as an emancipa- tion-comparable to the growing up of children, as they emerge from the restraints of parental control (the idea will mean little to American parents, but still has relevance elsewhere) and be- come legally and socially autonomous. And it was natural that the movement should all along show itself first among city dwellers, who are mostly merchants, traders, and in general men of money. Just as money-genuine money-is the socializer of goods, so  78 THE SECULAR STATE THE LIBERAL TRADITION printing is the socializer of thought; and the two were necessarily related.
