England, deserves most of the credit. In the sphere of authority her scholars could put up a case for as much apostolic succession as had the Bishop of Rome; but the historical argu- ment is perhaps less cogent than the living witness. If the one communion has to admit the century ending about 1850, its senior cannot forget a similar spell three hundred years earlier. And if the younger may truly claim to stem from the old trunk, it will recall how trees similarly cleft remember in the crown their com- mon footing. But the limits on the spiritual power of a national Church were not slow in appearing. It was not merely because Archbishop Laud had taken the royal office too seriously that Charles I could not save him from the scaffold: he had taken his own office more seri- ously than men were now willing to permit. It is not within the competence of a state Church to be no respecter of persons; and though perhaps Wingfield-Stratford is too harsh in deciding that Laud's failure "involved the failure of the Church to stand for any intelligible religious principle," 3 the lesson of 1644 was never for- gotten.

Like a good wife, it never advises and never criticizes, and when there is a row it stands up for its hus- band."
