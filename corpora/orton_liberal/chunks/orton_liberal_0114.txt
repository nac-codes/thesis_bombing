one started from the assertion that there was none. Says the Westminster Confession of 1647: "By the decree of God, for the manifestation of His glory, some men and angels are predestinated unto everlasting life, and others foreordained to everlasting death. All those whom God hath predestinated into life, and those only, He is pleased in His appointed and accepted time effectually to call .. . the rest of mankind God was pleased, according to the unsearchable counsel of His own will . . . to pass by, and to or- dain them to dishonour and wrath for their sin." And there was nothing they or anyone else-least of all the Church-could do about it. "There was no place for the very human Catholic cycle of sin, repentance, atonement, release, followed by renewed sin. Nor was there any balance of merit for a life as a whole which could be adjusted by temporal punishments or the Church's means of grace." 4" Such conceptions of the nature and destiny of man were potent to stiffen the tempers of the revolutionaries-just as those of Marx and the Nazi doctrinaires were to be three centuries later. In all three systems the notion of an elect plays a cardinal role, both theoretical and practical. What is still more important is that mem- bership in this elect has nothing to do with any existing or his- torical distinctions of rank, privilege, or function; nor can it be affected by any criteria or any policies originating outside its pri- vate organization-though the organization aspires to pass judg- ment (and execution) on all the rest of society. The believer is placed in an impregnable security: he has the truth, by faith and scripture; and it is a higher truth, whose service imposes a pe- culiar discipline and in return confers a peculiar emancipation. 4.
