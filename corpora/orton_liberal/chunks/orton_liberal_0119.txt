opinion of the judges-whom of course he appointed-that His Majesty was the "sole judge" of the question whether the realm was in danger. Even so, however, he had to demand cash on the barrel Stuart credit was never good; and Charles II's repudiation of his debts came, at a critical time, as a reminder that financing mon- archs was always a risky business. 87 It was, nonetheless, an old and well-established business-ever since trading for money created large accumulations in private hands. Christians as well as Jews went in for it when they got the chance; and the expulsion of the Jews from England in 1252 was forced on a reluctant king more by the jealousy of their rivals than by any other factor. For the Jews, confined by the laws of christendom to city life, had on the whole sharper wits and more ready money; and they could enter into the usury contract with Gentiles when Christians could not. What constitutes usury is the stipulation for the unconditional payment of interest on an unproductive loan; strictly speaking, it has nothing to do with the rate. The usury laws of several Ameri- can states which proceed, as English law did up to 1854, by pro- hibiting or penalizing interest rates above certain legal maxima, are based on the assumption that higher rates are ipso facto extor- tionate, which does not always hold good. The idea behind them, however, is fundamentally the same as that which underlies the Catholic objection to usury. That objection is based theoretically on the Aristotelian tenet that money is barren, practically on the fact that a usurious contract places the claims of capital ahead of those of humanity. That is what evokes the curses of farmers on moneylenders to this day, from the American Midwest to Egypt and India. The problem of how to treat the defaulting debtor antedates even the laws of Solon. There is solid substance in the Catholic contention that the Church's prohibition of usury, to use a Keynesian phrase, forced savings into invest
