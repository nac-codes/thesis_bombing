people knew quite well what they were doing and why they were doing it. If the eighteenth century is to be considered an age of rationalism, these were the true rationalists. A lot of the proceeds, we must remember, went into the land; and as the enclosure of the fields followed on the enclosure of the commons, the returns on that investment were included among the proper criteria of policy.

Between the national states it let loose a naked struggle for power that finally dispelled the dream of community: while within some of them, particularly Prussia and England, it witnessed the development of toleration as part of the process of secular integration.
