. The legislator or any other alleged possessor of power is as powerless as a private person to silence the sense of right of any individual whatever . It lies in no man's power to decide what shall have the force of law. For nothing is really law except what proceeds from the single source which alone can give a rule the quality of law, the ultimate sense of right. What does not come from this source may be enforced by the power of the state or it may be applied in the decisions of the bench, but it is not and never can be law." 16 Professor Roscoe Pound and other modern jurists have criticized the natural-law basis of sovereignty on the same ground as the critics of the pre-Christian era: namely, that it does not furnish a specific consensus of ethical judgment. It boils down, says Pound, to what the individual conscience dictates; and consciences differ. "An eighteenth-century jurist laying down natural law and Ben- tham's man who claimed to be one of the elect are in the same position.

For lack of it, as Pound points out, jurists have fallen back on interest as the basis of law, and have conceived the problem of jurisprudence as the evaluation or harmonization of interests-as indeed, on the practical plane, it largely (though never wholly ) is. But the prob- lem is insoluble without criteria. The evaluation of anything is impossible without a standard. The assumption that out of the clash of group interests as such an harmonious synthesis can be devised or discovered is simply a return to natural law by
