iency, and within the same limits. The mere fact that a state may rest its decisions on a majority vote, actual or retrospective, gives it no more right to invade the personal and spiritual liberty of its or anyone else's subjects, than has any other form of government; nor may it arbitrarily enlarge its scope or magnify its purpose in order to do so. The term "conscientious objector" means for the contemporary reader the conscientious objector to war, who is prepared to carry his objection to the point of disobeying the relevant orders of the government. That is the one class of case for which special legal provision is made in free countries; and they should proudly cher- ish that provision as a very talisman of liberty. It is made because even today people are not quite easy in their minds about com- pulsion to kill, and because of the total nature of the disposal of persons which modern states claim for that purpose. But war is not the only possible sphere of conscientious objection. Religion of all kinds has produced it; and we may wonder how freedom would have fared if it had not. Educational policy in both France  THE LIBERAL TRADITION 98 and Britain has proved, and may again prove, a critical issue; and in the United States the sphere of race relations is now very dangerous ground. The reason that there have not been more such issues is that on the whole, in the states of the English tradi- tion, governments have learned to keep their hands off matters as to which the conscience or the deep conviction of any consider- able number of people may be affronted; and the people in turn have learned that while a man may differ profoundly from his gov- ernment as to the advisability of particular ends or the expediency of the means adopted, he may nonetheless be a good citizen. One wonders whether both lessons are not in some danger of being forgotten as the total compulsion of recurrent war engenders a disposition to extend it, on the grounds of "preparedness" or "
