The United States has developed a habit of emergencies; it will prob- THE SECULAR STATE 99 ably have one in the backwash of the European war, and will cer- fainly have another if or when Mr. Lerner's political associates get within sight of office. The fact that the state has-or should have the monopoly of coercive power makes it a valuable prize to any class that sets its own interest above justice or the common good. It is entirely possible for the state to be captured by such a group Lit has happened several times in our generation-and success- fully perverted.

That is a manoeuvre that liberals must resist from the outset; they betray their own cause when they give it countenance or encouragement. The difficulty of keeping political authority within bounds is in- creased as constitutional representative government degenerates into popular democracy, and politicians turn propagandists. The idea of disinterested deliberation on which the American form of government is explicitly based is undermined by the adoption of mechanical and psychological techniques for manipulating mass opinion.
