in 1814 they are reduced to the status of sheer beggars-even though all they ask is that the laws be enforced. It was not so in Plantagenet or Tudor times, not so under Elizabeth and Burleigh. Liberals are too apt to assume that their main task was accomplished in this year or that, with the establishment of parliamentary rule and the successive measures of religious toleration-and so to become conservative, or even reactionary. But their current task was created for them in this great change, not in the structure but in the conception of government; and much of the theory that ac- companied and masked it merely added to the difficulty of a problem yet unsolved. Maine's famous description of government as developing "from status to contract" has been much overworked, and made to bear 2. Belloc, H., The Contrast, chap. iv.

The essence of a contract is mutuality; and the idea that government rests on some sort of compact or contract is a very old one. It goes back to Saxon times, and is still embodied in the British coronation service, where we have the dual ideas of consecration and assent. Preservation of the Â«customs and ancient liberties" of the realm has been for over a thousand years part of the bargain.
