not repeat itself, has a way of hammering at the same lesson until either it is mastered or the pupils are dropped from the school Locke's function was in the literal sense conservative-in the sense that when one is caught in a blind alley the first thing to do is to turn back.

The confrontation has surely at times been dramatic enough! Locke, a political exile, saw the state mainly as organized co- orcion; and his concern was to say to it, Thus far and no farther.
