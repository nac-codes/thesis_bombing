perty from which the concentration of economic power is built up. What Locke and the natural-law school, including the Vatican, refer to is the precise opposite of that. Yet even in its own terms the radical attack is generally na√Øve; for it accepts the conventional association of property with control, and seldom deigns to notice the extent to which modern governments have changed the situation by divorcing control from ownership. This is the particular defect of state socialism, which-thinking still in eighteenth-century terms-assumes that the only way to get public control is to transfer title from private to public hands- while in point of fact, for better or worse, private ownership is already stripped of the power of control in vast fields affected with a public interest, and many interesting and successful forms of joint equity have been put into practice. Property differs from possession in the legal recognition of an asserted claim. That recognition is granted, or withheld, on terms, and the terms are constantly being revised. While property remains private, there is always some degree-nowadays a rapidly increasing degree- of supervision over its scope, use, and abuse. Should the state be- come owner, the question Quis custodiet custodies? becomes both urgent and unanswerable. The indiscriminate attack on property as such, so far as it has any meaning, remains an attack on the basis of social cohesion- which is what Locke and his followers, in England, France, and America, so clearly perceived. They were not prepared to allow the political organization of society-which in France and America was obviously a deliberate and late creation-to violate the more fundamental relationship between a man's work and its tangible result; they rightly saw that where that relationship is insecure. all freedom is imperiled; they were close enough to reality to know that it is work, not talk, that makes the world go round; and they did not suppose, or wish, that "the state"
