tionship is insecure. all freedom is imperiled; they were close enough to reality to know that it is work, not talk, that makes the world go round; and they did not suppose, or wish, that "the state" could either do the work for them or produce benefits that were unrelated to it. No one would deny that modern developments of the property right, SOVEREIGNTY VERSUS COMMUNITY 113 especially in America, have created grave problems as to its scope, its function, and its distribution; but that fact does not impugn the institution as such. If the abuse of an institution is to justify a demand for its abolition, there will soon be little left 4 law or society. It should not be necessary to remark that Locke was not the author of all the perversions of the property right that a chrematistic society invented, or tolerated; he can hardly be credited with the devices of absentee ownership and fiduciary control that were to make property for power so different a thing from property for use. Nor can Locke-although he opposed the old usury law-be held to have engendered the dominant money consciousness of the century that followed his death: Laski, in the passage above cited, makes too quick a jump from "property" to "prosperity." Certainly there were inconsistencies and limitations in Locke's philosophy that kept it short of a true humanism; but it will support a distributive ideal much better than a capitalist one was Jefferson realized. And in making secular coercion answer- able to moral postulates, and basing the property right on per- sonal effort, Locke cleared the foundation on which liberals of all shades have continued to build. It is significant that Laski now sees Russian communism (or whatever is the current name for it ) as the historic successor to Christianity, while the Church of Rome re- mains the one society that stands dogmatically firm on the private property of John Locke; though its scholars would protest, with some reason, that that is to give Locke credit
