Nonetheless, a strong element in proletarian mythology is the belief that it is possible for employees to retain the relative stability of contractual remu- neration-indeed, to enhance that stability-and at the same time capture for themselves the gains accruing to those who de- pend on a noncontractual and unpredictable return; while leaving 121 the losses to be absorbed by some other entity vaguely called the "state" or the "community" which in this connection means simply "not me." Under no system whatever is this possible; and the readiness to believe that it is springs from our innate disposition to evade responsibility. So well has this disposition been exploited by journalistic demagogues and some trade-union officeholders that a considerable proportion of wage-earning labor in the United States is now socially irresponsible. A contributory element in proletarian mythology is the notion that somewhere, at some time, the mass of the laborers did in fact receive both types of return, and were ipso facto better off. The myth of a primitive communism has been completely dissi- pated by modern scholarship, and the idea that the majority of the people ever "owned," either individually or collectively, what are now called the "means of production" is applicable only to a level of sustenance hardly distinguishable from animal life. Be- vond the most primitive stage, differentiation of function and conscious cooperation take the lead in social organization.

But the transition from such cases of common rights to the modern con- ception of collective ownership is illegitimate; as are all such efforts to read modern notions of ownership or other insti
