tion than before. To this discovery Marxists can no doubt reconcile their consciences, since conscience is also, for them, a class phenomenon; but to the historian there would appear to be some difficulty. For one thing, the whole category of economic classes, invented by Marx in a more-than-usually Hegelian mood, is a generalization so broad as to be less than half true; it gets its modern currency from what Professor Whitehead calls "the abstract level of common thought." And history- except as delivered by a Marxist-is superbly in- diferent to it. There are times and places when the state has cer- tainly been under the dominance of a particular economic class; others when it has just as certainly not been; and all along a chorus of innocent people, including the wisest of mankind, insisting that it need not and should not be. It is hard to suppose that such peo- ple for three thousand years or so have been entirely deluded. The Marxist will reply that for almost as long a time good people be- lieved that the earth was flat. The allegation is doubtful; but at any rate, they were agreed that the earth was there, and they knew what they meant by it. A reading of history inspired by so thin a conceptual outfit as the theory of economic classes cannot fail to produce chimerical results. The traditional policy of English gov- ernment, we have said, was from the days of Alfred that of a trust, a stewardship. Not to attribute more virtue to the rulers of Eng- land than is their due, we must note that the circumstances of the island kingdom favored that policy. There was less temptation, because there was less opportunity, to buttress authority by bring- ing in force from outside; and every time that was attempted the results were disastrous to the monarchy. Thus the English crown ranked itself, on the whole, with the people against privilege; the French, with privilege against the people. And for the same basic reason, England was integrated as a living, working society
