crown ranked itself, on the whole, with the people against privilege; the French, with privilege against the people. And for the same basic reason, England was integrated as a living, working society long before France. The hard-shell units of feudalism, the exclusive pretensions of the towns and the gilds, the extraterritorial claims of the clergy, had all been dissolved before the seventeenth cen- tury. There was security of life and property under the king's peace, of commerce by the king's measure and the king's coinage, of travel on the king's highway, and of justice under the king's law : none of it perfect or complete, but all of it so well established that the English "revolution" could be a quiet and simple affair turning upon a single issue. The corresponding integration of  124 CAPITAL AND LABOR THE LIBERAL TRADITION France was still lacking at the end of the eighteenth century, and what there was of it had an autocratic, highly centralized character that survived in the post-revolutionary systems, and broke when Paris fell. French unity depended upon Versailles; London was only in a limited way the center of England. And though history has most to say about the doings in the capital-the debates, the royal decrees, the statutes, and so forth-the common law and liberty of England, the sense of fairness that underlay its social and eco- nomic relations, were not made there, but in the estates, the vil- lages, the market towns and remote universities of a land that was a community before it became an autocracy.

Systematic economic enquiry takes its rise from certain seventeenth-century skeptics who wanted to know just what this greatness-of-the-nation p
