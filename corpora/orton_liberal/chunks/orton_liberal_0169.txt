Systematic economic enquiry takes its rise from certain seventeenth-century skeptics who wanted to know just what this greatness-of-the-nation policy amounted to in terms of ordinary individual welfare. It is high time the question were asked again. But in Tudor times -as matter of money; and during the centuries in which the money now, for that matter-the greatness of the nation was largely a economy was being established, the interests of foreign traders and those of the state had seemed plausibly to coincide. The scram- ble for "treasure," of which monarchs never had enough, led to a bullionist policy of trade regulation, under which foreign cus- tomers were always to owe a net balance payable in precious metal, But as mercantilism matured, it was the great merchants them- selves, especially those of the East India Company, who argued that they (and, of course, the nation) would get along better if they were allowed to trade more freely, using gold as needed; and before the seventeenth century was out, there were one or two who saw that the real value of the trade was in the general im- ports, of which gold was only one. Then came the great campaign of Burke and Smith in the issue of American liberty; and Smith extended the argument for more freedom to a general case. Let trade follow its natural lines-which would be on the whole (he rightly discerned) those of the climatic zones: in that way the nation, rather than one particular class, would get the benefit of the exchange of products-and so would its trading partners.
