e new policy. And when the final strain approaches, it is the artisans who are the conservatives, looking for justice to a state that used to protect them, only to find that state now in possession of the radicals, their masters. The same long process is at work in the development of the anti- combination laws. Before the industrial revolution combination is one thing-an upsetting of the order of the well-regulated state: after it, quite another-a questionable interference with the wise conduct of industry by the employers. The Bill of Conspiracies of 1548 was aimed primarily, like earlier laws, at illicit disturbing of the price level: whether by craft gilds or journeymen's associa- tions. But when the London feltmakers get into trouble in 1698,2 or the couchmakers in 1716,3 or the tailors in 1721,4 or the weavers in 1756,5 the issues are essentially those only too well known to- day as "industrial disputes." 2.

The claim of the masters to be let alone proceeds on parallel 127 lines in respect of their business operations and their relations with their workpeople. But the government, mindful of the older wadition of England, was more reluctant to concede it in the lat- ter case than in the former. As early as 1549 we find the laissez- faire argument applied to the corn trade and the question of land enclosure. It continues, with increasing effect in legislation, right along to the nineteenth century. "It is an undeniable maxim," says an advocate of enclosure in 1656, "that everyone by the light of nature and reason will do that which makes for his greatest ad- vantage. . . The advancement of private persons will be the advantage of the public" 6-no need for the state any more to bother
