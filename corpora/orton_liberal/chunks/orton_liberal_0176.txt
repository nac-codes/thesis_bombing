In the earlier period, the influence of the American Revolution was already at work in the Corresponding Societies when the French terror supervened; and the anticombination laws take their place in the whole series of repressive acts and actions. But with a unique distinction: they constitute the first occasion on which the interests of the state are legally identified with those of the employers: they write into English law a novel crime-the crime of interfering with the employer.
