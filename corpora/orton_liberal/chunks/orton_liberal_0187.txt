nce fought on the Protestant side: that is, all the king's horses and all the king's men-but by no means all of what was aspiring to be France. Pleas for internal unity were lost in the clamor for external victory; but behind external victory arose internal dissension, temporal and spiritual, and the nascent liberalism of the time was drowned in violence. Its loss not only cost thousands of Protestant lives, but made the very basis of authority a political and religious battleground. The theory of sovereignty itself became an open wound in the side of France, that had never a chance to heal. Well might it seem to the Bour- bons that the commonweal-when at last they had time and en- ergy to set about it-depended upon extreme centralization; and  THE LIBERAL TRADITION 138 that authority could not be centralized without also being abso- lute,a fallacy that has disastrously persisted. Under the absolute monarchy, backed by the Gallican Church the various elements of French life were visibly pulled together: but it was rather as subjects of the crown than as members of the commonweal. The unity was, and remained, that of a system rather than of an organism. Colbert, says the Cambridge Modern History.
