it, the deeper goes the divisive effect. The English always retreat before an ab- solute; the French advance. The English survived their "glorious revolution" in virtue of their distrust of both glory and revolution; had they seriously discussed first principles, the Lord knows who might now be ruling England. But the critical Declaration of a doubtfully authorized convention was a masterpiece of makeshift, and the fundamental stipulation was not even mentioned, namely, that William had to sign before they put the crown on him. Such a way of settling a revolution could never satisfy a French- man: what a wasted opportunity! To the French approach, the oc- casion for a constitution would demand that it be made clear and consistent. The basis of authority could hardly escape definition, and some sort of an absolutism would thereby get established- probably in the form of universal first principles (evident espe- cially to Frenchmen). Within a generation or two the French mind, unable ever to desist, would discover, or rediscover, some slightly different basis of allegiance. The matter would begin in the schools, go forward in the journals and the caf√©s, and end-it has happened before-on the barricades: for the Frenchman is much more likely to act in conformity with what he believes, or thinks he believes, than is the Englishman. On the latter, the sense of solidarity with his class, his people, his tradition is a powerful check (usually mistaken for muddleheadedness); to the former, sheer intellectual integrity-the integrity not only of his own mind but of the French mind as he has received it-is a point of honor; and in both cases the issue may touch the nerve of a very stubborn pride. If therefore the essence of liberalism is a denial of all absolutes, if it is merely a relativism based on practical expediency, it will always have-as it always has had-rough going in France. Liber- als themselves very easily forget that it is only to political or- ganization that li
