351) but asserted freedom of occupation by abolishing (on parchment) the gild limitations on apprenticeship. The device, however, was even less successful than its English counterpart; and the following century saw the beginning of a policy that was ultimately to prove fatal to the crown itself. The traditional rights and privileges of the gilds were reaffirmed; but with a careful reservation of the royal prerogative. The use of this prerogative came to be concerned less with the economic func- tions of the gilds than with the fiscal necessities of the crown, As early as the reign of Louis XI (1461-83) we find the sale of mastership being resorted to to raise revenue: that is, the grant of the mastery to outsiders-sometimes untrained persons-in return for a contribution to the royal exchequer. The policy was continued on and off for three centuries, and elaborated by the INDIVIDUALISM 141 arbitrary creation of new offices and the direct establishment of royal monopolies (also for lease or sale ) in the newer trades. From time to time, notably in 1581, attempts were made at the com- pulsory extension of corporate organization where it did not al- ready exist; partly to facilitate trade regulation, but partly also to provide new centers of tribute. The increasing financial diffi- culties of the crown thus committed it more and more deeply to the maintenance of commercial privilege; and although regula- tions were sometimes enacted to mitigate the pressure of monopoly by the opening of markets, the vested interests proved too strong for their success, while the financial tie-up precluded any states- man from pushing the matter to extremes. The final outcome was ironic. The state, despite the success with which in certain directions it had furthered the producers' inter- est, became identified in the popular mind with the economic op- pression it had been forced to tolerate; while the oppressors them- selves-the gilds and corporations-went bankrupt under the in- cessant
