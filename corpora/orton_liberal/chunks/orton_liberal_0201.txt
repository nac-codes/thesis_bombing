Religious organizations no less than economic ones wer penalized by the fundamental law of individualism; and Rom fought all the harder because of the involvement, and the incon sistency, of French policy in the temporal affairs of the Vatican But under the struggle for power was the enduring issue of prin- ciple; and the Church attacked, and has continued to attack, the pet dogma of the revolution with its inherent trend toward mate rialism and secular absolutism. The fact that Mussolini attacked it too does not make the Vatican fascist: even Benito had his in- sights. The issue was no theoretical debate.

But that was the year of the First Interna- tional; and when French wage earners received a qualified liberty to organize, their leaders-who were probably more literate tha those of any country except Prussia-were already prepared for and largely imbued with, the revolutionary materialism of Mars and his French precursors.
