XI, chap. xxv. 20. Quoted in Galton, A., Church and State in France, p. 192. INDIVIDUALISM 151 ganized labor, almost from the start, thought of itself in class terms unmitigated by much sense of spiritual catholicity-and not or- ganized labor only, but the mass beneath. The condition of Paris after the national defeat of 1870 showed in lurid light the depth of the chasm already existing in French society: the spectacle im- planted a lasting horror in the mind of the radical mayor of Mont- martre, Georges Clemenceau. But it was not to be the last time that blood would flow from the fusion of those same two issues: the struggle of a class against the state, and the attack of revo- lutionary atheism on ultramontane Catholicism. Neither the Com- munards nor the ultramontanists can be saddled with all the blame; there was something wrong with the state too. Why else, in both spheres, should it resort to such savagery in reply? When at last the proscription of the Communards was relaxed, and the exiles began to return, the case of the wage earners for full freedom of association was backed by the Catholic Church; for the same individualist dogma that had hampered organized labor was now turned even more vigorously against organized religion.
