French labor became the headquarters of direct-actionism: the policy of using the power of organized labor to hold both the state and society to ransom; a power that was used with reckless effrontery against even a socialist premier in 1936, successfully defying the concept of legality itself. By that time the ideological or spiritual disintegration of French society had been steadily deepening for two generations; and the state, dominated for those same two generations by a cynical and fre- quently corrupt materialism, had lost the key to a synthesis. § 5 THIS problem of the synthesis or reintegration is by far the most momentous that modern France has to tackle; and there is no  THE LIBERAL TRADITION 152 issue to which leaders of thought elsewhere should pay more careful attention.

They have not complained. Bitterly as they have reviled one another, a sort of defiant pride in the experimentum crucis has sustained them, rising tragically to a higher plane than the mere pride of power or possession that other nations tiresomely display. For the problem of synthesis that the French are facing in this twentieth century is far more significant to the future of mankind than the what-we-have-we-hold policies of the British or the naïve notion of "policing" the world entertained by their trans-Atlantic cousins who have so much difficulty in policing their own polyglot cities.
