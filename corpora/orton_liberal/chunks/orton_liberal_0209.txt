From the ruthless pro- scription of the Communards to the smashing of the great railroad strikes of 1910 and 1920, the middle ground in the economic sphere also was becoming less and less tenable.

Similarly, the gradualism of Jaurès, like that of Blum a generation later, was made more and more difficult to maintain or to popularize; especially in view of the rival militancy of the nationalists. The situation at this point was essentially sim ilar to that of Germany around 1930. The flamboyant nationalism of Déroulède's League of Patriots of the Action Française, the Camelots du Roi, the Croix de Feu and many more ambiguous groups got its emotional start from the reaction to a military humiliation; just as the same sort of thing was to do in Germany later on. But it found the basis of a more lasting program in opposing that peculiarly abstract form of materialism which operates through the institution of large- scale public debt.
