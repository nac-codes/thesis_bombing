The logic of tactics, in this war behind the war, is with the extremists. Armed with the dogma of economic determinism, they alone have the apparatus and the resolution to tear to pieces the national community as a s a necessary preliminary to the construction of a new society out of selected fragments. But the fate of Trotsky -who alone was consistent-shows how any self-conscious com- munity is likely, in the end, to deal with that endeavor. There is an instructive irony in the position of those intellectuals who thought they saw in Moscow the realization of an international brotherhood, and are now tied to the chariot wheels of a power- politics that has grafted the ruthlessness of the class war onto the old stem of pan-Slavism. It is a safe prediction that that position will not commend itself for long to the majority of the French people; and those who defend it would be wise to take warning. They include many whose display of patriotism in the political exe- cutions of 1944 contrasts rather oddly with the amount their logic permitted them in 1939. At this point, it is evident, we face an impasse. Looking at the logic of the situation as France has revealed it, we have found no clear lead to freedom within community in the fervent national- ism of the Maurras-Barrès school; we have dismissed, on different grounds, both the idealist internationalism of the Jaurès type and the more iconoclastic methods of his rivals; we seem to be left with little more than the status quo.
