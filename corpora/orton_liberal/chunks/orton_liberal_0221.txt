Men die not for freedom in the abstract, but for freedom to pursue or preserve some line of ac- livity of whose value to mankind they are utterly convinced. And who has not at least read what a mockery abstract freedom be- comes to a man for whom society can find no useful employment- even though it may have arranged to keep him alive? Now this manifoldness, this richness and variety of free ac- tivity, was realized in the nineteenth century on a brilliant and perhaps unprecedented scale. Every sphere of Western culture was enriched by new discoveries, new insights, new tools and potentialities. The power and scope of human action, for both good and evil, were enormously and much too swiftly enlarged. What was lacking was some impulse to integration, some secret of synthesis, that could prevent this dynamic mixture from blow- ing society into fragments, spiritually and perhaps physically as well. That is no merely retrospective judgment: the lack was evi- dent to many men in many different lands and vocations. Walt Whitman was one of them. "Go on, my dear Americans," he ex- claimed about 1880: "whip your horses to the utmost-excite- ment! money! politics !- open all your valves and let her go- swing, whirl with the rest-you will soon get under such momen- tum you can't stop if you would. Only make provision betimes, old States and new States, for several thousand insane asylums. You are in a fair way to create a whole nation of lunatics." There was a Saul among the prophets in the person of Alfred Nobel, the "dynamite king" and donor of the so-called peace prize -for which the original inspiration probably came from his friend and antithesis, Bertha von Suttner. Nobel had little faith in the power of intelligence and good will to control the situation he had done so much to create. "I should like," he said, "to be able to turn out a substance or a machine of such horrible capacity for mass annihilation that thereby wars would become altogether im- possible." 1 He h
