have lived by; in our own day, and in spite of the sacrifices we have made to it, it has become admittedly thinner and less satisfying. But other types of association-including the family itself-have become thinner too. The home, the farm, the manor, the estate, as centers of integrated living, have been subject to a progressive dissolution that is not merely, nor even mainly, economic. Com- pare, for instance, the activities that radiated from an Episcopal see in the sixteenth century, or even the restricted group that focused upon the cathedral itself, with what remains today. It is trite, and not quite accurate, to point out that the activities have largely become specialized- a good many have ceased altogether; others, of course, have undergone an autonomous development with an enlargement of scope that was not necessarily an improvement. But take the whole range of administration and local government, the cameral economy, the chapter, school, and seminary, the asso- ciated crafts, the music and other arts, the library and record of- fices, the social services and minor ministries incidental to the main functions-it is a sample of very varied activities integrated, as far as was needful, not so much by pattern as by purpose or central direction; and while some of those activities have been im- proved as well as extended in the process of detachment, they have also become fragments of a whole that is not there any more, in that fundamental sense, and has not been replaced by any equally significant form of synthesis. In generalizing the functions a good deal of the integration was not extended but lost. Or consider the scope and content of integral association rep- resented by a well-developed gild, for comparison with that of a modern organized industry. Of course, the industry can boast a greater variety and quantity of product, a wider market, technical and managerial efficiency, specialization and subdivision of labor and all the rest of it; but what strikes
