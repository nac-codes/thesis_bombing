the industry can boast a greater variety and quantity of product, a wider market, technical and managerial efficiency, specialization and subdivision of labor and all the rest of it; but what strikes one, in most cases, from the associative point of view is that the concern is split right down the middle by the struggle over the division of the income, and that  THE LIBERAL TRADITION 166 the effective basis of organization on both sides is exclusively eco- nomic. The productive function has largely ceased to be a basis of significant community, and that basis has not been supplied by anything else. The gild type of association, as we see it in Roman as well as medieval life, allowed the community of cooperative work its natural expression on other planes of social activity, in- cluding a good deal of art and festivity, mutual aid and collective benevolence, and a sense of significant purpose that spoke the same language as other kinds of association. A generation ago students were afraid of idealizing the nature of gild society, and tended to represent its passing as an inevitable phase in the " "evolu- tion" of modern enterprise. Now a more serious risk lies in the opposite tendency to minimize the radical contrast, and deny its significance. A strong case can be made to show that the decline of gild society was by no means inevitable, nor due solely to the operation of technical and economic factors. The kind of fatalism that so easily besets certain schools of historical interpretation has its roots in an impulse to evade fundamental issues.2 We must not, of course, be led in d into supposing that earlier types of community could in any case have continued without change or that they can be re-created in close semblance of their original form. Such questions are not our present concern. What we have here to notice is the broad fact of the loss, or attenuation, of the spirit of association itself, the drying up of its sources, above all the comparative shallownes
