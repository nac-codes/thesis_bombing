What we have here to notice is the broad fact of the loss, or attenuation, of the spirit of association itself, the drying up of its sources, above all the comparative shallowness of the type that came to dominate or devour all others, the territorial nation-state. Yet here too we must make a careful distinction between the national community as a concrete fact of cultural, historical, and functional experi- ence, and the political state of the later nineteenth century that claimed to represent, or even to be, that community in its or- ganized and external aspect. The validity of that claim varied very widely between different cases.

National states, in their external aspect, are power organizations pure and simple- or at any rate, simple: offensive or defensive, according to circum- stances. Indeed, when a state
