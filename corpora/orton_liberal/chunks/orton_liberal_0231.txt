we have the beginnings of wider community; for though not all nations use the same unit a yard is a yard and bears the same relation to a meter or an arshin whether you happen to be in New York, Paris, or Moscow. Whether it is either desirable or possible to achieve a similar result in r gard to units of purchasing power, the nations have not yet de cided. All such activities, however, are open ended, in that thev are not designed to exclude anyone or monopolize anything for the national group, and in many cases are entirely suited to co operation that ignores political nationality completely.

Now we are watching a suspicious and desperate poker game with the revolvers under the table. Are these the same entities that we were just now considering? No, they are not; even though they go by the same names and wear the same clothes. These are states; those were communities; and between the two there is a great gulf fixed.
