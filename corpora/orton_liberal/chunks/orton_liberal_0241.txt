of mere political nationality were superseded by the great discovery of the master race. They did not demand sole credit for that contribution to human brotherhood; they were only too will- ing to share the honors with a Frenchman, an Englishman, and a couple of Americans. Said one of the latter: The backbone of western civilisation is racially Nordic, the Alpines and Mediterraneans being effective precisely to the degree in which they have been Nordicised and vitalised. If this great race, with its capacity for leadership and fighting, should ultimately pass, with it would pass that which we call civilisation. It would be succeeded by an unstable and bastard population, where worth and merit have no inherent right to leadership, and among which a new and darker age would blot out our racial inheritance. Such a catastrophe cannot threaten if the Nordic race will gather itself together in time, shake off the shackles of an invertebrate altruism, discard the vain phantom of internationalism, and reassert the pride of race and the right of merit to rule.11 10.

T+ was just another case of manifest destiny. And at that we leave the matter, regretting particularly to exclude the comments e must of some of the other vertebrates who have long since learned to refrain from destroying their own species.
