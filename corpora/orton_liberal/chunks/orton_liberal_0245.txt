real," but had a subjective, fugitive, romantic, illusory quality that you could take seriously or not just as you pleased: it would make no great practical difference to a world that was now going to be run by steam and electricity. Thus the poets, artists and men of imagination were gradually herded off in a sort of public reservation where people could spend a pleasant hour or two when they had the time; and if occasionally, in the dead of night, one could catch a queer wailing and roaring out there as if something primeval yet lingered-well, there was always the morning's work to attend to, and business was business. But the method of enumeration had its own surprises in store. For one thing, as it gained refinement and complexity, and to every new method of measurement some fresh pattern of regularity was disclosed, some people began to suspect that the trick was done with mirrors; and a certain doubt arose as to who was doing it. The world of the empiricists took on a sort of Pirandello quality, as objectivity itself threatened to turn into radical idealism. For another thing, the observed regularities were seldom quite com- plete, quite final; they showed a tantalizing imperfection that suggested not only endless refinements of measurement, but a possibility of substructure that knew nothing of the regularity science was seeking. And just as Dirac advises us not to try to form any visual or spatial image of what his equations refer to, so other scientists now speak of merely statistical laws and prob- abilities. Despite Whitehead's stern warning against the mathematical observations of nonmathematicians,2 one may perhaps remark that as the methods of measurement and enumeration have been refined and expanded, the world they reveal has come to bear less and less resemblance to that "objective world of science" which 2.
