Under a mask of specious objectivity, it offers formula that can have no significant relevance to the nature of society. And so far as the idea of simple enumeration has gov- erned the theory of democracy, it has done more than any other factor to render that theory abortive and dangerous. It is interesting to notice that even Rousseau was in some de- gree aware of the danger.

He gives the general will an absolute overeignty from which there is no appeal-not even a right of bellion-because it is supposed to be absolutely moral; but where it gets the intuition of morality is never explained. This is the same than HHlemma that we meet in Hobbes, who never tells us where Levia- Rousseau, went to school. And the source of it is the same in both. 1, like Hobbes, starts his specious logic with the assump- son of a total surrender of personality to the collective existence Â«the total alienation to the whole community of each associate with all his rights"; 4 it follows that whatever each associate may get out of it will be something less than free personality.
