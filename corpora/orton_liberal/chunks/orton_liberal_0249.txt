enerality required that its sphere of opera' tions be strictly confined to those of the most elementary char- acter; and in so far as it impinged on the activity of free per- sonality, its influence could not be other than retrograde and atavistic. But, it will be asked, was not that the very point of the laissez- faire philosophy that grew out of individualism? The answer is laissez faire rested, as a whole, on much narrower ground. There both yes and no; but rather no than yes. The antistate attitude e of were liberals-of whom Acton represents one type and Herbert Spencer the other-who saw the problem in its broader aspect cts; but the liberal case for civic freedom is much older and strong than the argument of laissez faire, and the latter, as a historical ger movement, hardly touched the central issue. For laissez faire was characterized by an absorbing preoccupation with the expansion (not merely the maintenance ) of economic activity. It opposed state action in certain spheres on exclusively economic grounds- it similarly opposed all types of corporate life except those which represented organized capital. But its nineteenth century ex- ponents were, in most cases, quite willing to tell the state what would be, as well as what would not be, commendable activity from their point of view; and they gladly recognized-again, with one or two exceptions-the idealization and personification of the state as rather useful than otherwise to their main interest. For the prospect of material aggrandizement has an almost universal at- traction; the inflation of the ego by identification with the group is one of the most primitive impulses; and the two together make an almost unbeatable combination, easily able to swing into its orbit other constituents of common consciousness-legend, his tory, tradition, even religion-in the most wildly distorted forms The process by which this is accomplished is itself worth noting The normal function of the more literate and vocal members
