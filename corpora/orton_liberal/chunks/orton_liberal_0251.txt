axiological levels, so it is with a group. The steady decline of the value plane on which the national aggregates cohered was mani- fest in an increasing materialism coupled with increasing irra- tionality, of which the growth of racial intolerance inside the vari- ous communities was, and remains, a striking symptom. Under these circumstances, the mere increase of numbers was a de- pressing influence; for in the absence of strong counteracting forces, the highest common factor was bound to fall. The exten- sion of elementary education was not, as it turned out, to be reckoned among the counteracting forces. A general ability to read and write may merely implement the maxim that evil com- munications corrupt good manners. Universal literacy as such is an axiologically neutral extension of human potentiality, like any other offshoot of applied science. It is only because the tran- scendental drive is so deep rooted in ordinary human nature that society got some good, as well as evil, out of the greatest revolu- tion of our era-the revolution of the rotary press. A factor of primary importance to the cultural quality of the  THE LIBERAL TRADITION 186 national aggregates was revealed in the fine study made by Thomas and Znaniecki of The Polish Peasant in Europe and America. This important work, published in five volumes in 1918, was the fore- runner of many studies in the nature of social process of which the Lynds' Middletown is the best known. The investigators hoped to derive, from their work on this special case, some observations of general import; and to a remarkable extent, they succeeded One of their observations, empirically established beyond ques- tion, especially concerns us here. It may be sufficiently indicated by the following quotation (Vol. I, chap. iii) : The pace of social evolution has become so rapid that special groups are ceasing to be permanent and stable enough to organize and main- tain organized complexes of attitudes of their members which
