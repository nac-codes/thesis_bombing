A further tendency toward the impoverishment of the com- mounal idea arises strictly within the economic sphere. Modern states, i , in proportion as their mutual competition has increased, have also been internally afflicted by the growing disparity of economic interests. This is an aspect of the matter that we shall presently examine; but it may be said at once that while the no- tion of economic "class" has proved quite unable to generate a fruitful and constructive form of human association, it has been extremely effective in dissipating the strength and content of the sense of national community.

The contributions of Gierke and Troeltsch were outstanding; they aided the work of Le Bon, Duguit, Romains and the French pluralists, and of Maitland, Fig- gis, Laski, Cole, and many others in England. Among many exiles whose work has helped to extend this interest in America, the name of Arnold Brecht deserves especial mention. Very broadly speaking, this revival of interest had two related objectives. First, it sought to clarify the distinction between com- munity and state, and to rescue the former from the latter; sec- ond, it explored and deepened the historical, legal
