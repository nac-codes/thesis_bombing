evident that if you insist on regarding mankind only in terms of numerical  190 THE LIBERAL TRADITION REINTEGRATION aggregates, the uniformities you discover will have a subhuman quality. What was perhaps unfortunate was the carefully incul. cated belief that all other characteristics are unreal and imaginary The social implications of this viewpoint have been under af- tack from several quarters. Bergson, for instance, long before his conversion, was insisting on what he called the fallacy of dis- creteness.

Modern sociology has an inherent disposition to regard the hu- man individual as a mere by-product of social or cultural process. a mere overlapping point of innumerable groups; and so to deny him any significance or efficacy in his own right. A large body of fact supports this view: the sort of fact that the methods of sociology are adapted to discover. But even among the sociologists are some who warn us not to take it for the whole prospect. Trotter. the philosopher of "herd instinct," will not allow that the whole of personality is exhausted in its social aspects; and all those who, like Sorokin, are determined to steer clear of determinism have to find elbowroom somewhere in their systems for you and me, as recognizable entit
