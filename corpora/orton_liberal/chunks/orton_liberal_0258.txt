A considerable number, following Pareto, have us classified into active "elites" and more or less passive masses: again, with much justification. But the ground of the classification is exceedingly abstract; any attempt to apply it in specific terms leads to difficulties. It is evident, of course, that any reader of these lines belongs to some sort of an elite-either in vir- tue of his interest in the subject, or his having the price of the book, or his wife having friends from whom she has borrowed it. A fortiori, therefore, the writer belongs to the elite. He devoutly hopes, however, that the reader will refrain from mentioning 6.

There is ob- sious truth in the view that intellectual and cultural values are most clearly realized by minorities, through whose influence a process of diffusion continually goes on; but to think of these minorities as actual numerical groups is quite misleading.
