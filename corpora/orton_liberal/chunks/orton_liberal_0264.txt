If that is clear, then the living truth will inform the second and third spheres also; and if that is wrong then all else will be wrong-that is, disorderly, chaotic. No church or sect has, or claims, a monopoly of this perception. But in the general eclipse that accompanied the rise of technical civilization, a certain advantage lay with what is now quaintly termed "institutional religion." That had, at least, a toughness of tradition, of dogma and liturgy, that could protect the essentially religious impulse until the smoke began to lift. The Protestant sects, within whose membership was some of the purest piety, were more exposed to the individualism of the era; and popular religion tended more and more to become identified with individ- ual morality. But any religion conceived primarily as a system of individual ethical sanctions is bound to be largely anthropocentric, and will probably end by losing, or discarding, its religious con- tent altogether with no serious sense of loss. The ultrarespectable religion of Victorian times-Matthew Arnold's "morality touched with emotion"-was not religion at all, and it was never quite clear why there should be any emotion. We have since heard a good deal about "scientific ethics"; and it is evident that sects whose major emphasis has been on individual conduct are running more and more to ethical culture, amateur psychiatry, and social re- form-in which fields they are neither fish, flesh, nor fowl.
