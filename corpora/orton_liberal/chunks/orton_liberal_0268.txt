For instance Conybeare somewhere picks up the biblical phraseology about "the right hand of God" and has a lot of fun with the notion of a god who had right and left hands. Of course Conybeare knew far better than that (he was an Oxford don who specialized in Armenian archaeology ) but he had a motive. The famous battle between science and religion had its comic aspect, inasmuch as very few actual scientists took part in it, and  THE LIBERAL TRADITION 198 what was being defended had very little to do with religion Most of the triumphs of scientific method have in fact been accom- plished by men who recognized the validity of religious appre- hension, such as Newton, Kepler, Pascal, Leibnitz, Faraday, Har- vey, Priestley, Pasteur, Darwin, Wallace, Mendel, Romanes, the Thomsons, Rutherford, Jeans, Eddington, Compton, Einstein Whitehead, Planck, Millikan, Langmuir, James, Bergson, Münster- berg, Jung, and a hundred others. On the other hand, the war riors of the American "Bible belt" in making a totem of their sacred book, had really blinded their own eyes to the the magnifi- cence of the heritage they had there. Under these circumstances wooden swords and tin helmets could put up a tremendous clat- ter; until it began to rain in earnest. Nonetheless, there was something far from ignoble about the mountaineer with his shot gun and his Bible (especially if one forgets that he occasionally went on a lynching bee). And if puri- tanism had lapsed far into bibliolatry, at the opposite extreme the religious synthesis was effectively obscured by a rigid in- stitutionalism.

It is not possible to ignore the fact that the in- fluence of those policies extended far beyond the great events and the critical years, out into the seminaries, the bi ne bishoprics, the schools and pa
