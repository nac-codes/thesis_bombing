Or has such knowledge merely endowed the human creature with far more powerful tools for use in either direction, without materially affecting that inner citadel where the use of the tools is determined? Does the increased expectation of life furnish demonstrable ground for an increased expectation of wisdom? Dr. Irving Langmuir, Nobel Prize winner and associate direc- tor of the General Electric Research Laboratory, in an important address on December 26, 1942, issued a plain warning against the current overvaluation of science. It is often thought by the layman, and many of those who are working in so-called social sciences, that the field of science should be un- limited, that reason should take the place of intuition, that realism should replace emotions, and that morality is of value only so far as it can be justified by analytical reasoning. Human affairs are character- ized by a complexity of a far higher order than that encountered or- dinarily in the field of science. In the complicated situations of life we have to solve numerous problems and make many decisions. It is absurd to think that reason should be our guide in all cases. Reason is too slow and too difficult. We often do not have the necessary data. Or we cannot simplify our problem sufficiently to apply the methods of reasoning. What, then, must we do? Why not do what the human race always has done: use the abilities we have, use common sense, judg- ment and experience. Our morality is a kind of summation of the wisdom and experience of our race. It comes to us largely through tradition or religion. . . . The philosophical, metaphysical or even scientific analysis of the principles of ethics has not proved particularly fruitful. The difficulty for the modern positivist of accepting even so temperate a caution is twofold: it seems to take the meaning out  206 ยง 3 207 THE
