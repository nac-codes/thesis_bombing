Modern Christianity has had precisely the same task in confronting both the rationalist utopianism of Frederick Harrison, H. G. Wells, Iulian Huxley, Lancelot Hogben, J. T. Shotwell, and scores of others, and also the more dogmatic version current everywhere among the Marxists. The issue is well described by Professor Niebuhr: Our modern culture since the Renaissance has not taken the Christian faith seriously because it had a simpler answer to the problems of life.

Without such a faith, the modern man remains an in- veterate utopian, disavowing all religious ultimates in one breath and in the next breath affirming his faith in some incredible utopia, some impossible heaven on earth . If we engage in the task of world reconstruction without a disavowal of the utopian illusion, which has informed our culture particularly since the eighteenth century, we shall ask for the impossible by way of  208 THE LIBERAL TRADITION world federation or some world superstate; we shall not get it, and then we shall be tempted again to despair and disillusionment.Âª Modern positivism does in fact reflect not only the utopian illu- sion, but the utopian disillusion; and it is brought to the latter bu an intellectual as well as a circumstantial nemesis. The foundation of Herbert Spencer's work was laid, and a good deal of the structure erected, before
