xample of the characteristic fallacy of "social sci- once" and is worth noting on that account. Such descriptive gen- 211 eralizations as the one above, and the abstract concepts of which they are composed, may have their uses as guides to intellectual or even practical procedure; but there is no confusion more com- mon than to speak of the generalization or abstraction as if it were thing with an independent existence, and then attribute to it a causal role in the world of actual events. This slip over the line from intellectual abstraction to ontological postulation is the more dangerous because, as in the case above, it is usually unconscious; and its necessary result is a sterility or perversion of thought which no abuse of language can disguise. How far such abuse can go is evident in this attempt of a social psychologist to describe higher education: "In our age no personality can be regarded as prop- erly developed and molded if it has not been trained in the higher type of conditioning of adjustment behavior responses to abstract language stimuli, because the latter transcend in breadth and depth the content of concrete personalities." 8 As Humpty Dumpty said, there's glory for you! Insofar as an intelligible meaning can be got out of this passage, liberalism has to reject it. It is not true that "abstract language stimuli" transcend the "content" of personality; and the whole theory underlying this type of approach is one that liberalism has an urgent duty to oppose. Much modern speculation about the "course" of history, the "evolution" of culture, the "progress" of civilization, and so forth, has had the practical effect of persuad- ing the individual that the significance of his particular life and character, his particular moment, his particular generation, sub- sists only in reference to the condition and future of society as a whole; and that apart from that prospect, he and his here-and-now are devoid of anything that can really be called meaning.
