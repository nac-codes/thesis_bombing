or there is none. Perhaps Berdyaev has defined the issue more clearly than any recent writer. The modern doctrine of progress, he says, is spuri- ously messianic and millenarian, projected in a false "time," i which every generation becomes a mere means, an evanescent accident in the incessant extermination of past by future. . . There is no such thing in history as progress from good to perfect on a single plane of development. . . .

There is no reason for making one's optimism, creative energies and prospects depend on the modified val- ues of later generations. There is no ground for the conviction that these are more authentic than those which obtained in the past. . From the standpoint of the present, the future is no richer in realit than the past, and our efforts should be with reference, not to the fu- ture, but to that eternal present in which both future and past are one. Liberal philosophy therefore refuses to let the concrete reality of the here-and-now be as it were intellectualized away into the thin air of any sociological Weltanschauung; and by the same token it will not allow the separate specific human personality to be reduced to the phantom "individual" of abstract political or 9.
