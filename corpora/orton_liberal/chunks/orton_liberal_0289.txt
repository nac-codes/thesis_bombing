tion; that apart from these, mental and spiritual activity are simple delusions; that the kind of response a man will make to a given situation is "deter- mined" by the biological factors. Well, of course it is-in the sense that one does not get flute music out of a bass viol; but however this notion be elaborated-and it is elaborated in the most varied and ingenious ways- all the meaning in it is that a man behaves like a man because he is a man, and that if he were some other  THE LIBERAL TRADITION 214 kind of creature he would behave like that other kind of creature That is about as much in the way of a general theory of man as modern cytology will support. Proof of this profound theorem i constantly accruing as enterprising "researchers" discover new tricks to play on him, new bits to cut out of him and new drugs to squirt into him; for when these things are done, behold the man acts, feels, and even thinks differently from what he did beforel It is even possible, to a certain limited extent, to catalogue the differences and relate them to the means employed; and it is de- monstrable that if enough of these means are employed, the man will cease to be human at all. Some knowledge of the mechanism of the body is arrived at in this way, as are some useful devices for the correction of functional abnormalities; but to suppose that it sheds light on the nature of the human being as such is possible only to those who have made up their minds at the outset that the human being is nothing but an assemblage of biochemical reac- tions. There are questions one must not ask of these pundits: Why for instance, does the man make any response to the situation in the first place? To answer that, one has to drag in theories like "vitalism" which savor of philosophy or even religion-and what a theory is that which begs the entire question in the name it gives itself! Or, granting the profound theorem that hat a man acts in such and such a way because he is a such-and-such kind o
