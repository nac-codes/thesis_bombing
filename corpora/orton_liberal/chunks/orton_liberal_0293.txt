Religion, he averred, was nothing but on illusory compensation for the severity of the discipline which social life imposes; but whereas most of his followers show a pa- sonizing tolerance of religion as an opiate for the people (or the patient), not so the master. (It is noteworthy that this part of the exposition is cast by Freud in the form of a dialogue, in which a puzzled enquirer puts the questions, and Freud supplies the answers. "May I ask you to enlighten me?" "With pleasure. I was only waiting for this invitation.")
