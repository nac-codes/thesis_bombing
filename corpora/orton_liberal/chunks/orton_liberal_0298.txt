is both permissible and useful is that in which dogma is expressly recognized as defining faith, not knowledge. and it is to faith alone that the language of absolutism is osophically appropriate. The exhaustion of the materialist do phil- trine is patent when that doctrine itself dons the robe of dogmatic absolutism which it so strenuously denies to every other discipline loc- But in denouncing this pose the critic must not overlook the elements of truth that lie behind it. The idealist, for example, will deny that conscience is socially determined in a fundamental or total sense; he does not thereby deny that part of its specific con tent is so determined. A distinction is made between the inherent drive toward spiritual wholeness and the manifestations of tha impulse under any particular circumstances. Thus the notion that the separate individual conscience is an autonomous and final court of appeal is as misleading as the opposite ite error. In recog- nizing the validity of the appeal to conscience, one does not thereby assert that conscience is beyond and independent of all guidance and enlightenment. Similarly, when the idealist disputes the iden- tification of morals with mores, and maintains that there is more to morality than meets the sociological eye, he does not assert th the specific dictates of morality are all immutable.
