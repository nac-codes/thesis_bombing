as soon as he got the chance, he acted on wat professorial vision. He was the prime mover of the "wicked J'aiser" theory, and he brought the full force of his eloquence, his humanitarianism, and his position to encourage-one might say, demand-a political revolution inside Germany as a prelim- mary to the cessation of hostilities and the preparation of peace. Having duly produced the revolution, and enacted a model demo- oratic constitution, the Germans of 1919 were unable to follow the logic which nonetheless saddled them with the retroactive war guilt clause of the treaty, on which the reparation demands were made to depend; but if Wilson's logic was somewhat confused on that point, the blame was not wholly his. Still following his dream, in which nationalism, self-determination, and democracy were all vaguely synonymous with peace, he enacted a Palmer- stonian policy in a professorial garb; and the condition for entry of a state to the League of Nations was that it should be "fully self-governing." (How the Italians managed to get a seat for Ethiopia is one of the minor curiosities of history.). In thus imposing stipulations about the type of government as a condition of international comity, Wilson and his fellow ideo- logues were harking back to the principles of the Holy Alliance, which British empiricism had flatly and consistently rejected. The result was to start a widening divergence between British and American ideas of foreign policy, which reflected the divergence between ideological groups within each country.
