But the en- tire left in both Britain and America insisted that Britain ought to attack, not merely Italy, but fascism.

Actually, the nonintervention committee represented a much more consistent and authentic policy than that of the crusade for which the American left was clamoring nor was the argument for nonintervention weakened-it might just as well be strengthened-by the fact that three European powers had openly intervened.
