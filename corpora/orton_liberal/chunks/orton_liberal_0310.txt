loot in the world, it was probable, it was even cer- tain, that in t the end we also should be attacked. It is this realization which accounts for the sudden change of policy after March 15th. .. We would attain to such gigantic power that even the British fleet might be unable to restrain him. German armies might reach Istanbul and push on to the very confines of India Hor 250 years and more the British people have known instinctively that their safety depended upon preventing the continent of Europe, and therefore their sea communications, from falling under the dom- imation of a single Power. It was this instinct which prompted them ( at great cost to themselves ) to fight Spain, Holland, Louis XIV, Napoleon od William II. They called this instinct by varying names. Sometimes they called it "The Balance of Power"; at other, and more sentimental moments, they called it "The protection of the smaller Nations." Yet whatever names they may have given to the instinct it was there as a durable, firm and recurrent element in their national destiny; it is a sound biological instinct; it is the instinct of self-preservation. It is conditioned by hard and inescapable facts.3 The preservation of what Britain has organized and accom- plished in this world is a motive that needs no apology; it is a cause in which the people of the Empire will offer their lives whenever occasion requires, and in which Americans may most honorably stand and fall beside them. There might perhaps, on a most searching historical analysis, be valid and unselfish reasons why the United States, as a nation, should resist involvement; there could be no reason for Americans to deceive themselves as to the nature of the enterprise. Nor should they be allowed to. Any nation that deliberately embarked on an ideological or re- ligious war would be guilty of a crime against civilization; and a stupid crime at that, since ideas are not to be disposed of, as are human beings, by the use of high explosive. 3.
