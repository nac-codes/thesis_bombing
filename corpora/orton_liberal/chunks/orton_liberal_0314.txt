dical quality of specific acts furnishes a safe criterion for intervention only to the extent that considerations of general policy, past and prospective, warrant the belief that such action will be truly constructive. An international tribunal armed with force must either get farther in (to the extent of becoming a su- perior diplomatic and political agency ) or keep farther out (to the extent, probably, of dropping the force). International action that goes farther into a situation than a policy of watchful waiting would take it runs, of course, head-on into the Wilsonian doctrine of self-determination, as well as the British principle of nonintervention. It is here that Mr. Loewen- stein's proposals boldly take the bull by the horns. He begins by noting the disparity between the ideals of the "Atlantic Charter and the developing realities of the international scene, and finds Article 3, which promises every people the right to choose their own form of government, "particularly objectionable." He claims that . . . there is no absolute right of internal self-determination, and con- sequently, that the victorious states must be prepared to claim, and must be permitted to exercise, the right of intervention in the internal affairs of any state which "chooses" a "form of government" constitut- ing by its nature and potential development a threat to their own se- curity and to universal peace. The logic of the idea is compelling; and as Mr. Loewenstein re- minds us, there is historical precedent. Napoleon applied it with- out scruple, and the Holy Alliance fashioned it into a policy- which England rejected; the rejection being amplified in the Monroe Doctrine. "Political laissez-faire," says Mr. Loewenstein, "became the credo of liberalism" and persecution of national or racial minorities failed, on the whole, to dislodge it. Noninter- vention is further guaranteed in several Latin American treaties, and was followed in principle by the League of Nations. The re- sult
