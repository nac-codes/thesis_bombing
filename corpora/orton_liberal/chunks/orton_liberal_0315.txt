acial minorities failed, on the whole, to dislodge it. Noninter- vention is further guaranteed in several Latin American treaties, and was followed in principle by the League of Nations. The re- sult was that "under protection of the dogma of internal self- determination" despots were able to subvert their own nations and then to turn their "loathsome practices" against others. There is indeed more historical precedent even than Mr. Loew- cites. The earliest instance is perhaps in the agreement made by Philip of Macedon with his Greek allies in 346 B.C .; and 233 the Old Testament preserves numerous cases in which the pro- tacion or practice of obnoxious systems was quite actively dis- couraged both by Jahveh and his chosen people. More recently, Le Anti-Comintern Pact of 1937 (Germany, Italy, Japan) was a dood replica of the Holy Alliance. Professor Loewenstein is per- Laps overgenerous in holding that "only governments are ag- pressive, not peoples," and that "since the Napoleonic period all major international wars have been started by authoritarian mon- archies or dictatorships." enstein RETREAT FROM LIBERALISM The author points with effect to current difficulties in applying "Atlantic Charter." He compares Roosevelt's statement of February, 1943, that self-determination does not permit any gov- mment to make slaves of its own people with Churchill's hands- of-Spain declaration of May, 1944; 11 and he asks whether royal- Act or antidemocratic governments-in-exile have an unconditional right to reinstatement. He endorses Roosevelt's affirmation that no free people will voluntarily adopt a Nazi or Fascist form of gov- omment; and in order to implement that postulate, he makes the following proposals: 1. Each defeated nation must hold elections for a constituent assembly to draw up a Constitution, which must be of the "demo- pratic-constitutional type." Elections will be under the control of the United Nations or an international police force. Collabora- tionists,
