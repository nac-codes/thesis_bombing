olicy may be doc trinaire even though its particular doctrine is admirable. The lack of the historical sense in Wilson was most conspicuous in that it permitted him to be an idealist most of the time and to appeal to history when it suited him. It is more logical, as does Professor Loewenstein, to throw history overboard altogether and ride the wave of the future on a fountain pen. But how far will it go? Undoubtedly, it will go as far as the physical force will take it; but force of this sort very seldom outlasts a generation-except in cases where the controlled territory is reduced to de facto colonial status, and the interests involved have produced an or- derly and quasi-permanent system of control. (Witness the man- dated territories of the League of Nations. ) That is the logical- and factual-outcome of the doctrine of intervention. No doubt, the reduction of a considerable part of the world to a semicolonial status might be justified by the planetary magnitude and universal beneficence of the end in view; many who are now dazzled by that end owe it to realism to follow Professor Loewenstein as to the means. But others may argue that the means would be self-defeat- ing. For what strikes controlled or disfranchised populations most acutely is not the splendor of the end but the immediate impact of the control; and in resenting that they are liable ( should it be necessary to breathe the name of Ireland? ) to refuse all collabora- further, exponents of the new legitimacy may discover that its uiding principle (whether financial or political) is no more ab- gute than the old one. Can we for instance really be sure that dly governments are aggressive, not peoples," and that demo- "tic freedom would reveal a controlling preference for peace- en under conditions that, to the best of our judgment, would be kiectively just? Perhaps, in time; but in this as in all other cases, Peace is not to be conceived in negative terms: it consists in the Pctension of the sense of
