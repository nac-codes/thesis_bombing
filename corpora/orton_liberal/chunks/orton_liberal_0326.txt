All that is changed-mainly by the enormous advance in the tech- nology of war, to which international realities are bound to con- form. Assuming that the announced intentions of the Anglo- RETREAT FROM LIBERALISM American allies toward Germany and Japan are carried out, there will be, for the next few decades, only three powers in the world 24] What can produce or control enough machinery, chemicals, and bert personnel to wage modern war.
