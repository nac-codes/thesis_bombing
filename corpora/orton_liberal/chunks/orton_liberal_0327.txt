It is a safe guess, backed by ample evidence, that the internal relationships of this vast system will in 30 circumstances be placed under the control of any external or- ganization. Second, the Russian empire, already two thirds the size of the British in 1939, and the largest integrated land mass in the world, similarly removes most of the Euro-Asian continent. And here again, it is reasonable to include in that system certain affiliated territories on both its eastern and western borders, whatever may he the political form of the affiliation.
