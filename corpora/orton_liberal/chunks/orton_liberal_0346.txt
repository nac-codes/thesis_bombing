ego-maximation, are so deeply involved in the totemism of na- tionality that a forthright emancipation from it must be the cardi- mal aim of liberal policy. That aim, in the circumstances of today, is revolutionary; and in pursuing it the liberal, like Pilgrim, ad- vances into uncharted and dangerous ground. He can point to no broad highway. He must instead seek out all possible paths of escape, trusting that the advance of many feet will widen some of them. But the geographical analogy is inadequate. The type of think- ing and feeling that our age demands is not simply or mainly di- rected to a wider geographical area. People of distant lands will remain strange and remote to most of us, however much we may learn about them; even foreign travel is apt to endorse the con- clusion that there's no place like home. The prime necessity is a more catholic conception of human nature, our own included, for which the absolutes of nationalism and racism will be too petty and provincial. Such a conception can be fostered by life in the small community no less than in the large one, since it is depth rather than breadth that matters, and the concrete is more salutary than the abstract. To this end the agencies of religion and edu- cation are obviously essential, with the former fundamental to the latter. It is of paramount practical importance to all men that they should cultivate the consciousness of that which is so far above them as to flatten out their local prides and particularities; for oddly enough it is only through the practice of spiritual humility that man attains his full stature.
