LUSION THE LIBERAL TRADITION other observers, arrive at the same conclusion as the the apostles of Christianity; the point at issue being not the necessity, but the nature, of the common religion. Man cannot redeem himself by any process of self-glorification; nor can religions be invented to serve a temporal purpose. The ideology of the peace-by-force school sits like a nightmare on the American mind. Its exponents find it necessary to be in- creasingly apologetic. The war administration, having played on the fear-motif in the period of undeclared warfare, logically plays on the force-motif as the clue to "security"; but it has signally failed to arouse any enthusiasm, and its refusal to make public the terms of settlement creates a profound distrust. The American peo- ple, both individually and collectively, are incredibly generous and altruistic; their conception of their part in world affairs is marked by a unique and almost passionate disinterestedness; they aspire to a role of constructive benevolence that is poles apart from the power politics of the old world; and if their childlike con- fidence is betrayed they will turn on the betrayer. The words of Vera Brittain, written in 1943, find a spontaneous echo in Ameri- can hearts: "The vicious circle of recurrent war will be broken for the first time when one side foregoes its 'right' to demand retribu- tion, and instead offers hope, comfort fort, support." The instinctive American attitude is far more deeply rooted in Christian idealism than is generally realized, and the proposals of Mr. Morgenthau and his backers, whatever their political pretext, do violence to something fundamental and indomitable. American Christianity, both Protestant and Catholic, may well rejoice that in the two re- ports recently presented to the Federal Council of Churches, so clear and realistic a statement of the common Christian tradition received so powerful an expression.7 We quote from the message of the Cleveland Conference: T
