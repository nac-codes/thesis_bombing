o were loudest in their optimism and most lavish in their promises of brave new worlds now hardly even bother to pretend; and while occasionally, in half-hearted tones, they repeat the old incantations, the ring of conviction returns only when they de- mand bigger and better armaments and peacetime military con- scription. The average American, to whom the most brutal war in history is still a remote and abstract affair, has no conception of the horror for which he is being preconditioned. If he had, he would give heed to the biblical maxim, Despise not the day of 261 small things. And if he could still find hope in his heart, he might reach out, in passionate scorn and indignation, after things that were not so small. A significant proposal was recently brought before the Royal Empire Society in London. Professor A. V. Hill, secretary of the society, suggested that the next war would be, not a conflict between armed forces, but a deliberate at- tempt by scientific methods to destroy cities, massacre populations and make whole countries uninhabitable. Â«The only hope of averting disaster which science misapplied could inflict on humanity," he said, "is an international brotherhood of scien- tific men with a common ethical standard by which potential crimes of this character would be exposed and prevented." 9 Many people have wondered how long the scientists-the advance guard of civilization-would consent to be passive tools of the forces of destruction, alike in the armaments and chemical indus- fries and in the service of the national war machines. But the situa- tion is not as simple as the opponents of war might suppose. Scien- lists, in their leisure hours, are also human beings, no more im- mune to patriotic appeals and alarms than the rest of us; only insofar as their international solidarity can be realized, in con- orious devotion to humane and constructive purposes, can they be called on for a stand that would be both costly and dangerous.
