ourg, and France also getting the benefit. The railroad system that conveyed the coking coal of the Ruhr to the ore of Lorraine was keyed into the fabric, and the mixed mills of the Saar Valley were fed by both. One of the principal products was cheap steel rails, and one of the principal families concerned was the Franco-German house of De Wendel. A sane world would have rejoiced over the expan- sion of its resources; and there were in fact certain leading men in both Germany, France, and Britain big enough to see it that way. But on the whole, the appeal of territorial nationalism to the mass mind was more influential. So the Versailles Treaty cut political and economic frontiers  THE LIBERAL TRADITION 264 across the whole technological integration, just as the Silesian struggle did farther east. The Ruhr remained German. The Lor- raine mills, with their insatiable appetite for Ruhr coal, became French. The Saar territory was placed under the absentee govern- ment of the League of Nations, but the French got the mines for fifteen years. It was not enough. French nationalism and high finance, which had taken a very active interest in the construction of Russian strategic railroads, and were now arranging a similar service to Poland, desired that the entire west European steel in- dustry be brought under French control. French realists, then as now, considered that the only way to disarm Germany. The Anglo- American blend of empiricism and idealism frustrated the attempt in 1919; it was renewed by Poincar√© and the Fr e French Army in 1921 and 1923. By 1924 the failure of that method was apparent; bayo- nets had produced neither coal, reparations, nor stock participation in German heavy industry. The following year Germany was to recover most of her tariff autonomy, and there was every prospect of a vigorous trade war. Thanks very largely to American initiative and assistance pacific counsels prevailed. The reparations incubus was lifted out of politics with the aid
