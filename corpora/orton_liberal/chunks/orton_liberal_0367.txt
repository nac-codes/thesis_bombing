Consider the outlook for a defeated Germany, a defeated Japan, Are the people of those countries to be allowed the opportunity of a rising standard of living, or are they to be isolated from all the rest in a condition of hopeless helotry? If the former, they must make a speedy reentry into foreign trade.
