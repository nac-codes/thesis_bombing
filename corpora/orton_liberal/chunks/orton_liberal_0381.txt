it may wither or be per- verted. Such perversion infecting the minds of a great people is a spectacle even more horrible than war itself. 281 ยง 2 SO LONG as law is the practical expression of a general sense of right, the amount of coercion actually required will stay at a minimum. But in proportion as law gets away from that basis, the amount of coercion required automatically increases. The attempt to enforce prohibition on the United States was doomed from the start because it made a legal crime out of action that was not generally regarded as a moral offense. In the resulting failure not only law but social cohesion suffered deep and lasting damage. Such damage must always ensue when the power of coercion rests on an inadequate basis of moral conviction. In recent times the state in America as well as in certain other countries has fallen into the hands of men who proposed to use it as the spearhead of fundamental economic change. For the moment we are not considering the ends in view, though we may cay at once that some of them are consistent with the liberal tradi- sion, and from that standpoint desirable. The question is one of means. New deals like that of Mr. Blum or Mr. Roosevelt are de- signed to advance certain social and economic programs that are, in the main, matters of opinion-of highly debatable opinion. Opinion in all such cases is a matter of propaganda and pressure groups among which the administration recognizes allies and ene- mies.
