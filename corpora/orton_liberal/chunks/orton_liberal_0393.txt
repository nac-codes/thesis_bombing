ortunity. Local governments and utility commissions can do much that is useful, and taxation policies should be directed toward the same objective. The program is economically as well as socially sound. In many areas of the United States, small and medium mills have come through the past decade with a better record than those of the industrial cities; and there is opportunity for many more, provided the requisite initiative is forthcoming. That, unfortu- nately, is hard to find; for the unwholesome urbanization of eco- nomic life has not only drained the countryside, but condemned to a routine existence a high proportion of those who might have been successful entrepreneurs and key men in small communities. This obviously touches on the whole problem of decentraliza- tion, which is one of the specific tasks of liberalism. It calls for de- termined cooperation on the part of all elements in society, and as a long-range project ranks second to none. For it affects not only production and distribution, but the conditions of both cultural and biological development. It is the one project that promises  290 THE LIBERAL TRADITION to salvage the family; and if people could be brought to see the future through the eyes of those who are the future-the children -the policy of decentralization might generate a commanding enthusiasm. $ 5 A SECOND and closely related problem is the restoration of an in- dependent and sound agriculture. From the liberal standpoint this cannot be solved by making the farmer a tenant or a ward of the state, or by making his livelihood depend on a perpetual pegging of prices, rigging of markets, and subsidizing of exports. Mr. Henry Wallace, in his famous booklet of 1934 entitled America Must Choose, frankly offered his program of state control as a second best to the alternative of restoring open international markets. He appears very speedily to have lost faith and hope in the latter- thereby contributing to its abandonment. There was a plausible
