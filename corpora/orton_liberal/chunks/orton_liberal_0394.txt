ond best to the alternative of restoring open international markets. He appears very speedily to have lost faith and hope in the latter- thereby contributing to its abandonment. There was a plausible argument that since urban industry had received so much state protection in the form of the tariff, agriculture should have a quid pro quo; and since tariff protection is not of much use to export commodities, subsidies were apparently in order. It was unfortu- nate that Mr. Wallace did not more vigorously contest the major premise of this argument. American high-tariffism did not really aid American industry. It pampered it, protecting inefficiency and waste, arbitrary prices and practices, reckless overexpansion floated on the export of capital; and the result was disastrous. No single factor contributed as much to prolong and deepen the world depression as did the Hawley-Smoot tariff of 1930. It aroused re- taliation and stimulated isolationism the world over, and in the end American industry and American investments were among the principal sufferers. Even yet the American public has not real- ized that political interventionism and economic isolationism do not mix. But what Mr. Wallace offered agriculture was an even stronger dose of the same bad medicine. To turn the economic clock back thirty years: to clamp the two hands at the angle at which they then stood: and to present the result as a "progressive" policy-that was a romantic performance at which historians will not cease to marvel. The money expended on it is water under the bridge. The unsalable surpluses will either rot or be given away; but other LIBERALISM IN CRISIS 291 nations will not give back the export markets with which Ameri- can price pegging presented them. It is pathetic to see export subsidies again resorted to, as a desperate final endeavor, in de- spite of the antidumping laws of this and other nations: 34 cents a bushel on wheat at this writing, 4 cents a pound on cotton-with Brazil still
