But there are now very few landlords who "grow rich as it were in their sleep," very few who enjoy a nonfunctional return; and much land passes into state ownership by that grisly method of confiscation called death duties. The Party also sponsors agricultural subsidies as an  292 LIBERALISM IN CRISIS THE LIBERAL TRADITION emergency measure for the postwar period; it opposes the alterna- tive method of tariff protection because it still urges a return to unfettered international trade; and its permanent policy aims at the restoration of agriculture, with a minimum wage law, as an efficient self-supporting industry-a not unreasonable aim in view of the strength of the English agricultural tradition and the effi- ciency of British farming. No permanent system of agriculture can be built on a basis of coercion and subsidy; and a liberal policy for the United States would seek to get rid of these features while conditions are favor- able.
