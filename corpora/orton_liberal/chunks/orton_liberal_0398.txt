On the other hand, the record of the coal industry this past thirty years, in both Britain and America, tells a tragic tale of failure of both courage and foresight; nor is this the only case. While one watches with a certain apprehension the advancement of American eco- nomic policy in Latin America, Liberia, North Africa, Arabia, Persia, and the Far East, one wonders whether a more courageous initiative in the home territory might not also be a good invest- ment: especially as it would not ordinarily be saddled with those expenses of military and naval expeditions which are properly chargeable against economic gains secured abroad. $ 7 ASSOCIATED with the conception of the state as entrepreneur is the assertion that it is the duty of the state to provide "full employ- ment." " The idea is neither new nor good. As Dr. Wriston very well puts it, "Full employment by the intervention of political power is based upon defeatist assumptions about our economy."
