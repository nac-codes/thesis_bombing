l the expenditure that the American Government has "organized" since 1932, its spokesmen now appeal to the war economy as a model demonstration. ? But it is not the model of a free society. This becomes startlingly evident when one reflects that the ideal of "full employment" con- tains a hidden stipulation; it means more than it says. If full em- ployment means merely that every willing worker should find a job, while there is no downward limit on earnings, then a slave economy could take care of it. Full employment, in every current proposal, actually means employment at a predetermined standard of real wages. And when the double stipulation is applied, the de- gree of constraint becomes apparent. The primary object of economic activity is the production of goods and services, not the distribution of "purchasing power" nor the "creation" of employment; both these are secondary and con- sequential to the main function, and if they are made primary, free enterprise breaks down. The constant adjustments of a voluntary economy rest on a far more elaborate and sensiti sitive organization than that of any conceivable centralized system; and while they entail from time to time disturbing (though not unmanageable) alterations in the quantity and location of the factors of production, those changes are far less onerous than the manifold and clumsy coercions on which a centralized system must depend. The government of a voluntary system will therefore be guided by two leading principles: it will endeavor to see that its own demands impose as little restraint and embarrassment as pos- sible on productive enterprise; and it will provide only such relief to both capital and labor as is necessary to render the transitions relatively innocuous. If this sounds very conservative by present- day standards, it must be noted that opponents of the voluntary sytem are in the habit of criticizing it as if there had been no rampant nationalism, no aggressive imperialism, no piling up of
