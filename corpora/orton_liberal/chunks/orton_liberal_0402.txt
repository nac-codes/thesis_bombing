From 54 to 64 per cent of the whole cost of the service is to come from taxation; of the insurance features alone, from 31 to 50 per cent. The cost will be very high; and with the increasing age composition of the population during the next thirty years, it will steadily grow higher. The aim is to establish for everyone, as of right, a minimum subsistence level under all circumstances. The popularity of the scheme lies undoubtedly in its promise of a degree of security to millions of persons that they would not otherwise be able to count on; but inasmuch as the scheme does not put the state into business nor provide any new sources of in- come, it is evident that it will not provide them with something for nothing. The only extra resource the state has at its disposal is the power to coerce through taxation and compulsory contribu- tion; though we might include the ways by which a state can get itself into or out of debt that are not available to ordinary busi- nessmen. Undoubtedly, however, the mass of the people do expect to receive more than they pay in. That cannot be true of the en- tire community; but since the number who expect to be mulcted is far smaller than the number who expect to win, popular support is assured. If, one would suppose, the ordinary worker in private employ- ment cannot earn enough to provide, with reasonable care and foresight, for the ordinary contingencies of life- e including mar- riage and the raising of children, occasional sickness and misfor- tune, and provision for old age-then there is something wrong with the level of wages, or the conventional way of living, or both. If we assume that minimum wage laws plus collective bargaining plus collective insurance against abnormal unemployment have achieved a fair standard of earnings, then our working community divides into three classes: those who can and do make voluntary provision; those who can and do
