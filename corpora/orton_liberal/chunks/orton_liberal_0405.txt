It rejects the tradi- tional liberal thesis that the voluntary production of goods in such kinds and quantities as their exchange value determines will of itself provide adequate purchasing power.

This goes far beyond a policy of merely sup- plementary state expenditure in depression periods. Sir William sharply criticizes the present government proposals for not going beyond this policy (Postscript, p. 262). His scheme envisages state expenditure on a scale hitherto undreamed of: "Under the condi- tions envisaged in this Report, probably not more than 25 per cent of the total national investment will be accounted for by private manufacturing industry" (par. 241). It is natural in this prognosis, as in its American counterpart, that far more attention is concentrated on the amount of state expendi- ture than on the goods and services which that expenditure is LIBERALISM IN CRISIS designed to produce.
