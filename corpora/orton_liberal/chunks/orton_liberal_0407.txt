risk bearers now come last, not first. Sir William argues with considerable force not only that con- sumers do not always spend wisely, but that they do not have the chance to spend wisely. "In a free market economy under pres- sure of salesmanship the Negroes of the Southern States of America have, to a large extent, obtained automobiles and radios and have not obtained good housing, sanitation and medical service" (par. 259). We are all aware of that; and the point is well taken. But  300 THE LIBERAL TRADITION unfortunately, the case is generalized. "The additional citizens' outlay might not be directed to those forms of consumption which were socially most desirable" (loc cit. ). The state knows best. Thus, like his American supporters, Sir William deserts the hu- mane empiricism of the Aristotelian tradition for the Platonic wis- dom of the philosopher-king; forgetting that the latter exists only in literature. Thus the mistakes and stupidities attending the exercise of freedom are made a general ground for the curtail- ment of freedom; and liberty ceases to be the "highest political end.' It is inevitable in this philosophy that all the customary in- stitutions and activities of a free economy exist on sufferance. Be- yond a very narrow range, the sacred right of free men to make fools of themselves and suffer the consequences of their folly is taken off their shoulders. Collective bargaining by sectional trade- unions is allowed to survive on the assumption that the "central organizations of labor" will hold the demands within a general pattern. But private initiative and the role of venture capital in creating, owning, and managing economic enterprise hang by a very slender thread. Sir William pays homage to the recognized political liberties; but his list "does not include liberty of a private citizen to own means of production and to employ other citizens in operating them at a wage. Whether private ownership of means of production to be operated by others
