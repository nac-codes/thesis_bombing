Own- ers in practice would hold on condition of good behavior, as judged from the standpoint of full employment; and the right of bequest would be even more conditional. 1 othings ope others as dasthem - les- yes! The administrative machinery by which the full employment policy is to be maintained is, of course, both more ubiquitous and more authoritative ( one must not say authoritarian ) than any that now exists; and its actions would seem to lie outside the scope of detailed parliamentary accountability.

And the means depend on state expenditure additional to all other expenditure, public plus private, and covered by loans.
