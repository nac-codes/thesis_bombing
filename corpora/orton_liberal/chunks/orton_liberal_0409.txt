authority will decide the other uses. There may be occasions on which budgetary balancing is a legiti- mate aim; but it is never to be a primary aim. This freedom of the administration from financial accountability is to be achieved-as it has been in the United States-on the principle that "the State in matters of finance is in a different posi- tion from any private citizen or association of private citizens; it is able to control money in place of being controlled by it" (par. 198). This means that the state is able to carry on indefinitely a borrowing-spending program that would break any corporation in no time at all: but only the state. (Sir William is not unaware that too stringent a taxing policy might lose votes. ) What a wonderful virtue is there! A citizen unversed in this gospel might ask whether the interminable loans would always be forthcoming. The answer is that, in contrast to previous declarations of Liberal Party policy in Britain and of orthodox finance in America, the state is to take over the central bank of issue, which will "become in peace as it is in war an agency of the State, to give effect to the national policy, and with the Governor of the Bank formally appointed by the Government" (par. 242). On the above lines, Sir William is able to argue, as Professor Seymour Harris has done, that a further, and almost unprece- dented 11 expansion of public debt is not only sound, but sup- portable without increase of the tax burden; since the expanding tax base provided by the expanding expenditure will take care of the expanding interest and sinking-fund charges, and these are all that need be seriously considered. If there are secondary effects adverse to the provision or maintenance of employment by private enterprise, the state is fully equipped to counteract them by an expansion of its activities. There is no stop this side of paradise; for the inflationary spiral is constantly held in check by an ex- 11. Almost, but not quite: the experience
