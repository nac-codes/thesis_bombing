Latins and the Irish, all men every- where, are to take it and like it-since it appears they are going to get it anyway. A real modification of the set of values demands far more imagination. There are a couple of rarely printed letters of Macaulay written in 1857-58 to H. S. Randall, the biographer of Jefferson,3 in which Macaulay demonstrates the folly and futility of the Jeffersonian ideal. "I have long been convinced," says Macaulay, "that institutions purely democratic must, sooner or later, destroy liberty or civilization, or both." France in 1848 set up a pure democracy, and there was every reason to expect a general collapse of society. "Happily, the danger was averted; and now there is a despotism. . . . Liberty is gone, but civilization has been saved." Under the American Constitution, says he, it is only a matter of time for collapse to be inevitable; for "your gov- ernment will never be able to restrain a distressed and discon- tented majority." Adversity will give the demagogue ultimate victory over the statesman, and either civilization or liberty must perish. Either some Caesar or Napoleon will seize the reins of government with a strong hand, or your Republic will be as fearfully plundered and laid waste by barbarians in the 20th Century as the Roman Empire was in the fifth, with this difference, that the Huns and Vandals who ravaged the Roman Empire came from without, and that your Huns and Van- dals will have been engendered within your own country by your own institutions. Thinking thus, of course I cannot reckon Jefferson among the benefactors of mankind. Macaulay's case is well argued. The English nineteenth century is studded with similar forebodings, both Whig and Tory, as to every extension of the franchise. And the warnings still have their relevance, the danger is still there. So what? The one thing we can- not do is turn our backs on it. If we accept it and wrestle with it, such a triumph is possible as only cranks and visionaries dreamed
