evance, the danger is still there. So what? The one thing we can- not do is turn our backs on it. If we accept it and wrestle with it, such a triumph is possible as only cranks and visionaries dreamed 3. See Beck, J. M., The Constitution, Appendix IV. ECHO OF AN OLD SONG of two centuries ago. Macaulay saw the danger, he could not dream the triumph; but the dream is life, the terror is the Boyg. How tranquil and secure seems the old home across the retro- spect of forty years! There was a true sanctity, with something eternal in its set of values. Yes, but we could not live in it now; and indeed, if we remember, we were eager to get away. Now it is gone, and can never be rebuilt. A new home must reformulate the values that were enduring. We toil in tears, for we actually knew and experienced the goodness of the past.

It was night in the wilderness when Jacob met the wrestler who would not give his name; and Jacob went forth limping. But he saw the dawn on Peniel.
