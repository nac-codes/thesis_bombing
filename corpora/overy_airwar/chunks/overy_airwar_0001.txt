analysis. It is a difficult task to compare the economic and scientific systems of the major warring powers without, albeit sometimes unconsciously, producing some scale of values in making comparative judgements. In war this is perhaps inevitable. One side lost the war; another side won it. It would be plausible to argue that the Allies made better use of their resources for war than did the Axis powers, but this was not always so. A comparative view allows a more critical approach to the waging of war on both sides. In some cases the Allies won their battles through the possession of huge resources rather than through the efficient use of those resources. It was possible for Axis forces to be used with great efficiency from a military point of view but for these forces to be overwhelmed by sheer numbers. A comparative approach is indispensable in illuminating such perspectives.  It is important to state at this point that the book has a historical rather than a polemic purpose. The war itself raises the temptation for the historian to be continually passing judgement on military decisions knowing as he does the final outcome of the battles for which such decisions were made. The danger here is that military history turns into mere argument with the figures who made it. In the air war the danger is perhaps more obvious with the debate about the efficacy of bombing still warm. I have tried to avoid this kind of argument. I have concentrated instead on trying to establish the historical context within which such decisions were taken. That the war did raise important ethical questions, particularly in the context of bombing, is clear. This account is not about the history of post-war recrimination. It is about the war as it was understood, however imperfectly or unethically, at the time. This of itself involves a great deal of historical judgement in analysing motives, purposes and choices. Moreover in the course of reconstructing that historical context many of the
