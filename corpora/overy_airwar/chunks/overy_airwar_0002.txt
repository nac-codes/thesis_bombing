Moreover in the course of reconstructing that historical context many of the myths sustained since the Second World War can be shown to be just that; myths created for a special purpose but uncorroborated by the evidence. In this respect history itself is the harshest judge of yesterday’s errors and the sternest critic of man’s unfailing propensity to see things as The final problem in so general a book as this is the source material. Even were it not for the fact that much of the necessary documentation has been destroyed or is closed to researchers, the sheer volume remaining would barely be covered in a lifetime and could not then be compressed into a book of 90,000 words. Much of the material used is therefore published, either as official histories, volumes of documents or memoirs. My own work on the Luftwaffe has proved invaluable as so little has been written on the German air force from original sources and it still lacks even an official history. This book is offered as an introduction to the general history of the air war and will, I hope, in its turn prompt more research in those areas still starved of scholars.
