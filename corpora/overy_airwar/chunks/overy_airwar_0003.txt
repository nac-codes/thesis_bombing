It could be argued that strategic bombing is the exception. The bombing offensive, the one ostensibly independent air operation, was regarded by some of its supporters as capable of winning the war on its own. For Britain bombing was the sensible successor to the old policy of naval blockade. Unable to challenge the Axis powers in Europe with large land armies, it was tempting to see strategic bombing as a way to destroy the German and Italian will-to-war without having to set foot on the Continent. A group of senior American soldiers subscribed to the same view.

In the end neither the British nor the American supporters of bombing could provide convincing evidence that the war in Europe could be ended from the air. Pressure from the Russians and the Joint Chiefs of Staff persuaded the Allied leaders that only a large-scale invasion of mainland Europe would achieve the desired strategic goal of defeating Hitler and liberating Europe within a reasonable length of time. In the Pacific the bombers had a better case. Japan’s economy was weaker and her air resistance much poorer. Bombing would avoid the needless loss of life that an invasion of the Japanese mainland would predictably produce. Yet the American defeat of Japan was a combined operation in every sense. Naval power cleverly combined with air power helped to back up and protect the long haul of the American and Commonwealth armies into the land perimeter
