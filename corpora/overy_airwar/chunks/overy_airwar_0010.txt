years of peace before 1939 and then at too short notice to allow strategic and operational planning to catch up with it before war actually broke out. The development of air doctrine during the intervening period concentrated much more on what it was already known that aircraft could do. It was as much recapitulation as vision. Even if air power could be exercised with greater intensity and better techniques during the second war these were changes of degree rather than kind. The impact of jet aircraft, rockets and nuclear power came too late to substantially change this fact, and were brought into none of the early strategic calculations of the major air powers before 1939. Preparations of a strategic, doctrinal and technical character were related closely to the world of 1914-18. technical lead 1n 1756-59. japan certainly Nad close to parity at the same time, yet 1n Doth cases that lead was squandered througn poor development procedures and wrong strategic decisions. With By the 1930s the lessons of the earlier conflict had been turned from a hasty empiricism into a refined doctrine. By 1939 even the refined doctrine was becoming obsolescent, overtaken by scientific and strategic events. But even though doctrine was sometimes inappropriate to the circumstances of war, the formulation of air theory before 1939 was crucial in understanding the actual development of air forces and the choices made about how they should be used. It is possible to distinguish four separate, though not mutually exclusive, areas of strategic thinking on air power: co- operation between ships and aircraft; co-operation between armies and aircraft; ‘independent’ or ‘strategic’ bombing; and aerial defence.
