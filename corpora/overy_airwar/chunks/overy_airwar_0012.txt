As there was no restriction on ships of less than 10,000 tons the Japanese navy designed small aircraft carriers whose effectiveness against larger warships more than compensated for restrictions in size.® The aircraft carrier lay at the centre of Japanese Pacific strategy. It was to be used for fleet protection, for destroying enemy ships and for bringing air reinforcements quickly to distant land battles.

It was to be used for fleet protection, for and south-east Asia, and was used with great effect in the fighting with China in 1937. Moreover the discovery that aircraft could destroy large warships provided the Japanese armed forces witha means of narrowing the gap that existed between Western and Japanese power in the Far East.
