By the 1930s the use of aircraft carriers to attack the enemy fleet, to protect the American fleet and to give flexibility to the defence of Pacific possessions was fully accepted. Because only limited intelligence existed on Japanese preparations the total number of carriers and naval aircraft available failed to match those of the Japanese navy in the Pacific; but the naval commitment to a carrier strategy bound the government to an expansion of naval aviation in the event of a deterioration in the military situation of the United States in the Far East.1! In Europe the attitude towards naval aviation and to carriers in particular was unenthusiastic. In Germany and Italy the carrier had no role at all. In Germany this was partly because of Luftwaffe claims to be able to attack ships at sea with shore-based aircraft under its own command and partly because of rivalry between the services. The Luftwaffe was reluctant to pass control over any air forces to the navy, whose aviation accordingly got the lowest priority.12 In Italy the lack of aircraft carriers stemmed from Mussolini’s mistaken belief that Italian bombers and torpedo-bombers could operate from land bases against potential French or British naval targets. It was only after the battle of Matapan that Italy began seriously to consider a carrier programme but with little success.13 What was more surprising was the weakness of the senior naval powers, Britain and France, in naval aviation and aircraft carriers. France possessed one converted carrier by 1939 and had one major carrier under construction but uncompleted by the armistice. Britain, although possessing the largest carrier force on paper, had failed to develop a doctrine for its offensive use, had too few trained nava
