Britain, although possessing the largest carrier force on paper, had failed to develop a doctrine for its offensive use, had too few trained naval pilots and carrier and naval aircraft considerably inferior to those of America and Japan.14 Two factors explained the situation in Europe. First of all the distances to be covered were small; the  Page 15 of 309 3% whose effectiveness against larger warships more than compensated for restrictions in size.® The aircraft carrier lay at the centre of Japanese Pacific strategy. It was to be used for fleet protection, for and south-east Asia, and was used with great effect in the fighting with China in 1937. Moreover the discovery that aircraft could destroy large warships provided the Japanese armed forces with a were essential to the success of any imperial expansion which might bring an armed clash with American or British naval power.” In 1936 Commander Genda completed the development of Japanese established capable of accompanying and operating with the Fleet in all waters of the globe’.1° If such a service was slow to develop it was due more to the policy of isolationism than to reluctance on Far East.11 forces to the navy, whose aviation accordingly got the lowest priority. In Italy the lack of aircraft carriers stemmed from Mussolini’s mistaken belief that Italian bombers and torpedo-bombers could seas in which carriers were to operate were narrow and subject to air attack from land-based enemy aircraft, or from submarines. The second factor was the generally poor relationship between air force and navies during the inter-war period. Naval conservatism was hard to overcome. Most emphasis in the 1930s was placed on the construction of fleets of new capital ships which were still widely believed to be unsinkable from the air. Even in Britain it was still maintained in 1939 that aircraft from carriers could only slow down large ships leaving them to be sunk by other
