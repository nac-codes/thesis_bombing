were still widely believed to be unsinkable from the air. Even in Britain it was still maintained in 1939 that aircraft from carriers could only slow down large ships leaving them to be sunk by other ships rather than by aircraft. Even in those cases where naval commanders were willing to adopt naval aviation more enthusiastically the air forces themselves, particularly if they were independent services as in Britain and Germany, were reluctant to divert air resources to navies or to work in co-operation with naval forces.15 The land-based bomber was seen to be the key to sea power in any future war and naval air arms, with their unfulfilled demands for high-performance special-purpose aircraft, became so many Cinderellas. The independent air forces instead brought their own doctrine for use in aero-naval strategy; the blockade from the air of the enemy’s sea-borne trade. This could be carried out by using conventional land-based bombers of long range with special armament. For Britain aircraft complemented a traditional strategy of naval and diplomatic activity to cut off supplies to a European enemv. The attack on trade was introduced during the 1930s as one of the roles assigned to bomber forces on the outbreak of a war.

Even and south-east Asia, and was used with great effect in the fighting with China in 1937. Moreover the discovery that aircraft could destroy large warships provided the Japanese armed forces witha forces to the navy, whose aviation accordingly got the lowest priority.12 In Italy the lack of aircraft carriers stemmed from Mussolini’s mistaken belief that Italian bombers and torpedo-bombers could operate from land bases against potential French or British naval ta
