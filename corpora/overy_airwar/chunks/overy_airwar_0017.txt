y.12 In Italy the lack of aircraft carriers stemmed from Mussolini’s mistaken belief that Italian bombers and torpedo-bombers could operate from land bases against potential French or British naval targets. It was only after the battle of Matapan that Italy began seriously to consider a carrier programme but with little success.12 enemy. The attack on trade was introduced during the 1930s as one of the roles assigned to bomber forces on the outbreak of a war. The only restriction imposed upon it was the need to avoid civilian casualties in carrying out such attacks, making it almost impossible to plan attacks on ports or food stocks. Merchantmen at sea were given as the prime targets.1© For Germany a blockade of Britain had become a real possibility by combining aircraft and submarine warfare. Yet preparations for such a contingency lagged considerably behind the idea. Not until 1939 did the German navy begin making plans for combined naval-aerial attacks on British shipping lanes beyond the range of British shore-based fighters. The Luftwaffe had itself only begun to plan attacks against coastal shipping and ports in 1938 and even by the outbreak of war had not yet produced special-purpose anti-shipping aircraft fitted with torpedoes. Nor did the air force and navy work well together on the planned mining campaign because of the diversion of insufficient aircraft for the task, and the refusal of Goering to give it any priority or to train the crews required for the specialized work.17 Raeder believed that the blockade strategy properly applied was ‘capable of exerting a decisive influence’.18 Even Hitler himself approved ‘of the view always held by the Navy, namely, that only that naval and air activity which is concentrated on cutting off supplies will help to bring about the defeat of Great Britain’.1° But lack of preparation, poor co-operation with the jealous Luftwaffe, and the failure to produce a satisfactorv long-range bomber all prevented the aero-naval str
