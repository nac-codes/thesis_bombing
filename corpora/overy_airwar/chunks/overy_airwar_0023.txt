he protection of ground troops and rear areas from enemy air attack. The best means of defence was regarded as offence, the ability to knock out an enemy air force before it arrived at its destroy the enemy armed forces... it is the task of the air force in leading the war in the air within the wider framework of the whole war, to serve this goal’.21 Since the strategy favoured by the army were all developed with the support of the German army in mind.22 The same was the case in Russia and Japan. leaders favoured independent command over air forces on the battlefield for they argued that this would allow more latitude in deciding the crucial areas for air support as well as giving greater freedom to choose whether to protect troops in the field or combat enemy aircraft and troops away from the battle itself. In addition the American air theorists developed the view that strategic bombing, carried out independently of the army, was a more useful way of making a contribution to eventual victory.25 On both points the army disagreed. The problem of air force command and battlefield doctrine was not resolved until the middle of the war when combat experience demonstrated the shortcomings of the army view. In France there was too little time for combat experience to provide lessons in air force use. Despite the fact that the French air force had won the battle for constitutional independence from the army in 1933, the unity of command over the armed forces remained, as did the predominant position of the army in French military life. Air force demands for an independent air strategy and for more tactical freedom in support of ground troops were both effectively combated by the over-representation of the army on the Commission du Conseil supérieur de la Guerre and the Section de la Défense nationale du Cabinet. By the outbreak of war French aircraft were to be used like French tanks, in close support of front ground units and tied to the commands of the ground forces thems
