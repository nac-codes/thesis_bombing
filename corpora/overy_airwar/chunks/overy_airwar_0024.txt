By the outbreak of war French aircraft were to be used like French tanks, in close support of front ground units and tied to the commands of the ground forces themselves.2° Even attacks in the rear areas on supplies and troops, although planned for, were regarded askance by the army commanders. General Weygand told a British audience in May 1939 that ‘Douhet has no partisans in France... There is something in these bombardments of defenceless people behind the front that smacks of cowardice which is repugnant to the soldier’.27 The attitude in Britain was, however, very different. The fear of a new continental commitment and the renewed horrors of army warfare along the lines of the First World War reduced army influence in favour of an air force capable of carrying out independent tasks through blockade and bombing. This did not blind the RAF to the need for army support, but it gave it a different character.

Resistance to such a view persisted, although it
