my economy and rear areas, in which case the army units would be unlikely even to see a British aircraft for they would be engaged on tasks elsewhere. Resistance to such a view persisted, although it was to be finally vindicated in North Africa and Europe after 1942. As a result of such resistance the air forces that faced the German attack in 1940 were used hesitatingly in a role that fluctuated between the French view of aircraft use and that of the RAF against an air force large enough to be able to do both. Although armv conservatism at times compelled air forces to adovt a restrictive operational framework. most armies agreed that if aircraft were to make a full contribution to defeating the enemv a ne i =a ee a — _ the army groups for use on mainly tactical missions close behind the front.*4 This integration of air forces with small land units was practised in America and France as well, as a means of checking aircraft were to be used like French tanks, in close support of front ground units and tied to the commands of the ground forces themselves.26 Even attacks in the rear areas on supplies and troops, doctrine stressed that aircraft should be used in as flexible a way as possible and should not be parcelled out to each small army unit for its own protection.28 The best method of defence against an Although army conservatism at times compelled air forces to adopt a restrictive operational framework, most armies agreed that if aircraft were to make a full contribution to defeating the enemy ground forces then tactical bombing attacks on rear areas, sources of supply, bases and equipment were equally as important as attacks on the battlefield itself. Although tactical bombing was operationally independent, targets were usually designated by army commanders while it was made clear that such bombing attacks were designed only to speed up the process of defeating an enemy army. This was not ‘independent’ or ‘strategic’ bombing in the sense in which its proponents
