t was made clear that such bombing attacks were designed only to speed up the process of defeating an enemy army. This was not ‘independent’ or ‘strategic’ bombing in the sense in which its proponents understood it, since it was undertaken in immediate conjunction with a land battle and was concerned not with long-term targets such as economic collapse or morale-breaking but with short-term objectives designed to hinder the direct deployment of troops or material in a particular battle. The most important target was enemy air power itself, in particular air bases and air supply depots in the immediate rear of operations. By 1939 the RAF was committed to carrying out ‘the attack on the German Air Striking Force and its maintenance organisation’ as a first priority in tactical support.22 The Luftwaffe was similarly instructed to protect the land advance ‘by an offensive use of air forces against the opponent’s air force in enemy territory’.2° In addition to such attacks bombers were also expected to attack stocks of military materials, supply lines and communications to the front and other military targets whose destruction would lead to the reduction of enemy fighting capabilities. This extended too, to attacks on aircraft factories where such attacks were likely to lead to decisive shortages for the enemy in the battle itself. Some air forces, in particular the Soviet and French air forces, favoured limited tactical bombing in the immediate vicinity of the front. The British, German and Japanese air forces all favoured more adventurous tactical bombing but in all cases such bombing was planned as an integral part of the general land battle and was subordinate to the needs of the LTECOOI LO CHOOSE WHIELHIET LO PLOLECt LLOOPs Lil Ule Leis OF COMIDAL CMemnly alfCrall allG LLOOPs AWay LLOIT) Lie VALLE ILSEll.
