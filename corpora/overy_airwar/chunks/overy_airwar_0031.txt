rge strategic bombing force was partly based on the belief that it might serve as a substitute for armed continental intervention through terrorising a European enemy from the air, and partly on the grounds that the existence of a terror bombing capability might deter a prospective enemy from aggressive acts. Most major air powers were aware of the terroristic nature of bombing but only the RAF believed that it would seriously act as a deterrent or, in the event of its use, so undermine enemy morale that it would force capitulation or the demoralization of enemy armed forces.3° Although Hitler used the terror bombing threat to gain diplomatic concessions, neither he nor the Luftwaffe staff planned seriously for its use against a major military power once war had actually broken out.

By destroying its key areas the armed forces of the enemy would be so weakened as to leave only token resistance to an advance by ground troops; or it might lead in certain cases to the enemy government giving up the struggle altogether.

In the United States bombing was used for the same purpose. General Mitchell’s attempts to secure an independent air force in the 1920s was underpinned by his argument quantitatively but which nevertheless attracted the more enthusiastic bombing theorists to morale as a potentially decisive target.25 Moreover the choice of morale served the political aims of those British and United States air forces favoured attacks against crucial economic and military targets. The British air staff saw such attacks as a means of reducing the offensive capability of an enemy air force and of producing
