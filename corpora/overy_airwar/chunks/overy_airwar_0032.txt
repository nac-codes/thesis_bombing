air forces favoured attacks against crucial economic and military targets. The British air staff saw such attacks as a means of reducing the offensive capability of an enemy air force and of producing ‘an adverse effect on the German war effort and German economic life generally’.3”7 Not until 1936, with the establishment of an Air Targets Sub-Committee of the Industrial Intelligence Centre, was a priority of essential targets worked out. An obvious choice was the enemy aircraft industry, on the basis that aircraft factories were ‘large, distinctive and vulnerable targets’.28 But the main argument concerned the relative merits of attacks on electricity, communications and oil. By the outbreak of war oil was chosen as the single most important target.32 In the United States, under the influence of General Mitchell, the air force developed a theory of striking at the ‘vital targets’, one of which was oil. Mitchell's supporters argued that an air force should attack ‘the whole of the “enemy national structure” and in particular the “industrial web””. ‘A nation’, the Air Corps claimed, ‘may be defeated simply by the interruption of the delicate balance of this complex organization... It is possible that a moral collapse brought about by the disturbances in this close-knit web may be sufficient to force an enemy to surrender, but the real target is industry itself, not national morale’4° At the Air Corps Tactical School throughout the 1930s the doctrine of strategic bombing of vital industrial targets was elaborated and strengthened by further research although no decision was made until 1941 about what the most vital targets actually were.4! No other air force became committed to the idea of long-range bombing of strategic objectives as a prime function of air forces. The Luftwaffe prepared target folders on all important British and French industrial installations without committing the air force in advance to any particular bombing strategy.42 The Soviet Union, which
