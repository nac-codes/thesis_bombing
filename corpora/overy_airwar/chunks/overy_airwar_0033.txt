uftwaffe prepared target folders on all important British and French industrial installations without committing the air force in advance to any particular bombing strategy.42 The Soviet Union, which had at first favoured long-range bombing, abandoned the pursuit altogether after 1938 in the wake of experience in the Spanish Civil War.*3 In fact all those who participated in the war in Spain emerged with considerable support for tactical air forces and a certain scepticism over the probable effect of an independent bombing campaign.“ By contrast, British experience of aircraft use in colonial crises in India or Iraq tended to confirm the importance of independent action, for aircraft on their own had proved capable of subduing rebel tribesmen through terror bombing tactics. Only when the RAF began to make serious operational surveys of the likely effect of a bombing campaign in the late 1930s did it become aware of the shortcomings, both technical and tactical, in carrying such an offensive out.*® By that time the air force was already too committed to the plan and, like its United States counterpart, too anxious to preserve for itself an area of action independent of that of the other services to be very disturbed by the obvious gap between strategic intention and the operational possibilities.  (iv) Aerial Defence The irony of the situation was that at the very time that the RAF re-emphasized its commitment in the mid-1930s to a strategic bombing force, other British airmen were at the forefront in the  development of a theory of air defence. The bomber theorists of the 1920s had rested much of their case on the belief that there was little effective defence against bombing. Douhet wrote that ‘the aeroplane is not adaptable to defence’ and that ‘nothing man can do on the surface of the earth can interfere with a plane in flight’.4° By the time Baldwin made his remark that ‘the bomber will always  Page 22 of 309 6% force and of producing ‘an adverse effect on the G
