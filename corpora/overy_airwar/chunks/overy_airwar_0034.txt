Not until 1936, with the establishment of an Air Targets Sub-Committee of the Industrial United States, under the influence of General Mitchell, the air force developed a theory of striking at the ‘vital targets’, one of which was oil. Mitchell’s supporters argued that an air force should attack ‘the whole of the “enemy national structure” and in particular the “industrial web”’. ‘A nation’, the Air Corps claimed, ‘may be defeated simply by the interruption of the delicate balance of this complex pursuit altogether after 1938 in the wake of experience in the Spanish Civil War.*2 In fact all those who participated in the war in Spain emerged with considerable support for tactical air forces and  get through’, the disparity in performance between fighter and bomber aircraft was still so low that the prospect of a successful fighter defence seemed correspondingly unlikely.4? Anti-aircraft defences and passive defences were developed only slowly in the 1930s as public concern at the threat of a bombing attack became more acute. America relied on distance as an immunity against such attacks; France on the fact that French industry was so dispersed as to discourage enemy air forces from seeking targets behind the front. Policies of active air defence remained half-hearted as long as the technical means of combating bombers was lacking. Two things revolutionized the doctrine of air defence and gave it a new strategic significance. The development of the fast monoplane fighters gave a growing performance superiority to the fighter, particularly when equipped with heavy armament. Secondly the long search for effective ways of predicting where bomber aircraft were coming from and at what height was finally resolved by the in
