hter, particularly when equipped with heavy armament. Secondly the long search for effective ways of predicting where bomber aircraft were coming from and at what height was finally resolved by the invention of radar and the development of an operational organization to use radar information effectively. The shift towards a mixed air doctrine of defence and offence was met with some reluctance by those in the RAF who favoured the bombing strategy. To admit that there was a defence against the bomber was to question the whole basis upon which an independent air force had been built up. That the bombing role did not suffer as much as it might have done was due in part to the growing preference for night-bombing over day-bombing, against which it was thought there was still no satisfactory defence, and in part to the hope that British efforts in radar and co-ordinated fighter  Aafanana urawld nant ha imitatad ahennd av natamntil it ure tan lata 48 Tn 1026 tha DAT andar nencoiuien Fram nalitiniane and canine ealdiare annantad tha Da aviantatinn Dlan undar urhinh evantar  Page 23 of 309 6% capitulation or the demoralization of enemy armed forces.2° Although Hitler used the terror bombing threat to gain diplomatic concessions, neither he nor the Luftwaffe staff planned seriously for its ‘the whole of the “enemy national structure” and in particular the “industrial web”. ‘A nation’, the Air Corps claimed, ‘may be defeated simply by the interruption of the delicate balance of this complex get through’, the disparity in performance between fighter and bomber aircraft was still so low that the prospect of a successful fighter defence seemed correspondingly unlikely.4” Anti-aircraft defence would not be imitated abroad, or not until it was too late.48 In 1935 the RAF, under pressure from politicians and senior soldiers, accepted the Re-orientation Plan under which greater emphasis than hitherto was placed on air defence and on the production of defensive fighters and anti-airc
