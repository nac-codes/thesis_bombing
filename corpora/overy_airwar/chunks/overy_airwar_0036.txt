re from politicians and senior soldiers, accepted the Re-orientation Plan under which greater emphasis than hitherto was placed on air defence and on the production of defensive fighters and anti-aircraft weapons. A defensive belt was formed from the River Tees to the Solent, which was supplemented over the four years between 1936 and 1940 by the establishment of the Chain Home radar stations giving early warning of approaching enemy aircraft.42 One of the key points of the scheme was communication; between radar stations and fighter controllers, between the controllers and aircraft in the air, between the stations and central Fighter Command. By centralizing the system it was hoped that intelligence could be disseminated much more rapidly and that operations could be mounted with much more effectiveness. Although tactics were to wait upon combat experience, one tactical principle was firmly understood before 1939; the object of the defending fighters was to destroy enemy bombers, not to engage in combat with escorting fighters. Since the objective of the enemy was to drop bombs to cause destruction and dislocation to military and economic targets the objective of a defending fighter force was to deny the bombers the opportunity to ENU VETICL ALE LULLE DICRGIIIS VUITTON BU E1Le LUMO Uh LLIB ML ALIBS UUIIUIIIS UL SLLALE BIL UUJELELIVES AS A PELL LUCIE UE ALE LUE. 2 AIS ULE WELLE PLC PALO LAL ECE LUISE U1L Ad ELIE Lede Dilitioll allt pursuit altogether after 1938 in the wake of experience in the Spanish Civil War.3 In fact all those who participated in the war in Spain emerged with considerable support for tactical air forces and a certain scepticism over the probable effect of an independent bombing campaign.â€œ4 By contrast, British experience of aircraft use in colonial crises in India or Iraq tended to confirm the importance likely effect of a bombing campaign in the late 1930s did it become aware of the shortcomings, both technical and tactical, in carrying such an
