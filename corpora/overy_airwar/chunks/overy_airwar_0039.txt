ible for the defence idea expressing the spirit of the new fascist Italians.*4 In the United States the Air Corps was still under the influence of Mitchell’s assertion that ‘to sit down on one’s own territory and wait for the other fellow to come is to be whipped before any operation has commenced’.*5 In 1936 Arnold, the future chief of the air forces, wrote that the ‘whole concept in the Air Force is offence: to seek out the enemy; to locate him as early and as far distant from our vital areas as we can...’.56 Even Bomber Command of the RAF, in the face of British efforts to arm for aerial defence, still maintained that the primary role of any air force should be offensive. The second factor that affected the development of defence doctrines outside Britain was the reliance based on anti-aircraft fire as a defence against attacking aircraft. In Germany, Russia and France in particular the massed use of heavy-calibre guns against bomber attack was stressed at the expense of fighter defence. In Italy and Japan even this was lacking for it was hoped that pre- emptive strikes against enemy air forces would make expenditure on anti-aircraft defences unnecessary. A final factor lay with the slow spread of radar and good communications equipment. Fighter Command relied on the most modern technical means for air defence and felt under no compulsion to spread the technical secrets until obliged to do so to the French in 1939 and the United States in 1940, by which time it was too late for either to establish a satisfactory air defence system before the onset of hostilities.*” Only the Luftwaffe approached the technical competence of British air defence even though research resources were diverted to other tasks of greater urgencv.
