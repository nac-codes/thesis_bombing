The fact that British strategy increasingly relied on sophisticated defensive technology had brought about a corresponding concentration of British scientific resources upon this critical area. The main areas of strategic air doctrine were not mutually exclusive, nor did they remain constant over the inter-war period. But even though all the major powers took an interest in each of the major strands of air doctrine and recognized to some degree their complementarity, there was already discernible before the outbreak of war a division between those armed forces that favoured a limited as distinct from a general exercise of air power. The former comprised those forces in which the doctrine of army co-operation was most fully developed to the practical exclusion of other alternative uses for air power. The latter were those forces in which all the areas of air power were pursued simultaneously and in an inter-related way. Under conditions of war the distinction between the two became clear. Before 1939 it was obscured by doctrinal instability. This was a product both of inter-service rivalry and of the rapid rate of technical change.
