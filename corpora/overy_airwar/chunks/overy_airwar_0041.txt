The guardianship of strategic prerogatives by the navy and the army encouraged the air force to think of prerogatives for itself. In some cases changes in army doctrine occasioned changes for the air force too, particularly in the area of tactical support where there were few doctrinal fixed points until battle experience determined what they should be. Another factor was technical change. Air strategy was closely related to technical changes and the rate of technical change was unpredictable and accelerating by the end of the 1930s. The ability to cope with technical change was in itself an important component of air strategy. An obsolete air force, however numerous its aircraft, was of considerably less strategic value than a smaller but technically superior force. Changes in aircraft performance or equipment could also alter doctrinal priorities. The shift towards fighter defence before 1939 depended entirely on new fast fighters, good radio and radar. The strategy could not be successfully supported without them. Similarly the possibilities of carryin
