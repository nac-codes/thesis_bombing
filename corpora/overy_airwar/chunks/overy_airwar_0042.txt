towards fighter defence before 1939 depended entirely on new fast fighters, good radio and radar. The strategy could not be successfully supported without them. Similarly the possibilities of carrying out an effective bombing strategy depended on aircraft range, bomb-load, bombing accuracy and the effectiveness of bombs, all of which were altering rapidly over the 1930s. Above all the instability of air doctrine lay in the fact that air forces were compelled to make guesses about how aircraft would be used once war had actually broken out. There was little experience to draw on about the kind of air war most powers expected to fight, so that much air doctrine was an act of faith that the guesses of one particular air force were the right ones. As powers became more aware of what potential air enemies were preparing to do the initial guesswork was often modified or abandoned. The large quantity of conflicting and uncertain doctrine contrasted sharply with the small quantity of practical experience. When this experience was widened in exercises and manoeuvres to test out particular doctrines it was discovered that there had been too little preparation and aircraft defence but few aircraft.5! Russia and Japan also had a system of decentralized defence districts with little or no advance warning of attacking aircraft and only arelatively small number of other fellow to come is to be whipped before any operation has commenced’.** In 1936 Arnold, the future chief of the air forces, wrote that the ‘whole concept in the Air Force is offence: to seek out the too much theory. The practical capabilities of aircraft had been prone to much exaggeration. Bombing and blockade were not as simple as Douhet’s paradigm has suggested. Moreover the emergence of fighter defence had, in a relatively short space of time, rendered much of the thinking on bombing obsolete. A new bombing technology was needed before bombing could hope to match the expectations held out for it between the war
