At the height of the Abyssinian crisis there were real fears that Italy would undertake a bombing strike against London in retaliation for British intervention in the dispute.52 Many such fears were exaggerated for they ran considerably ahead of the technical capabilities of bombing aircraft currently in use. They were nevertheless important as a measure of public concern at the changes air power promised to bring about in warfare. It was this same public concern that spurred governments on to carry out rearmament schemes and civil defence measures in France and Britain and later in the United States.©° It was concern over the political effects of bomb attack that prompted the Axis powers to build up large active and static defences and to boast that fascist armed strength would forestall the enemy from the air. If military leaders were uncertain about the prospects of a future war in the air, governments were compelled for political as well as military reasons to assume the worst. So much was this the case that by 1938 Hitler was able to brandish the threat of bombing as a diplomatic weapon, using it to put pressure on the western powers at Munich and successfully intimidating the Czech government in the spring of 1939.51 force too, particularly 1n the area of tactical support where there were few doctrinal fixed points until battle experience determined wnat they should be. Another rfactor was technical change. Ar The response of all the major powers to the new threat from the air was to embark upon a policy of air rearmament and a new arms race, while preparing the civil population to meet air attacks and, half-heartedly, exploring the possibility of outlawing air terrorism by international agreement. The scope of air rearmament was conditioned by the extent of the perceived th
