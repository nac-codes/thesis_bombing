to meet air attacks and, half-heartedly, exploring the possibility of outlawing air terrorism by international agreement. The scope of air rearmament was conditioned by the extent of the perceived threat and by the nature of military ambitions. Those countries more committed to air warfare gave greater prominence to schemes for air expansion. Where the army or navy had a large claim on military resources the opposite was the case. The influence of the more senior services in the military and political establishment ensured that politicians did not neglect the interests of military preparation in general in favour of an uncritical and panic-ridden growth of air forces. That such a danger was never far removed was shown by the clash of priorities in Germany in 1938-39, Britain in 1935-37 and the United States in 1940-41.92  The threat for which such preparations were put in hand had become clear only by the mid-1930s. The growing threat of Japan to British and United States interests in the Pacific, the fear in Russia that at any time the capitalist west or east might try to destroy the Bolshevik state, and the growing instability of Europe with the rise of fascist military power all contributed to the desire to arm in strength everywhere. For France and Britain there was an additional strain on military resources in policing and keeping together empires that were larger in extent than they had been in 1914. During the 1930s the arms race was largely confined to Europe. Japan was only in the process of creating a large-scale air force and an industry to support it and remained consistently weaker than any of the other major air powers before 1939; the United States sanctioned large-scale rearmament only when the crisis in Europe had reached a crucial stage in 1939. Within Europe the powers were more aware of where their interests and loyalties lay. Britain and France armed for a possible war with Germany and Italy. Germany re-armed to fulfil Hitlerâ€™s opaque ambitions
