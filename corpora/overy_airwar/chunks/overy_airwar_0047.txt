regarded the air force as an auxiliary service it was the most expensive of the three, and such large expenditures had to be justified in the face of naval or army shortages. In Germany the air force consumed some 36 per cent of all military expenditure between 1934-35 and 1938-39. In Britain the RAF took 36 per cent of expenditure in 1938, rising to 41 per cent in 1939.®¢ In both cases efforts were made to force the air service to take smaller funds; in the German case successfully. In the American rearmament programme of 1939 the air forces were also compelled to reduce the large allocation given to them by the President in favour of the demands of the army.S2 Nevertheless such constraints only imposed temporary limits; expansion was constantly revised upwards in the face of mounting international insecurity. All powers planned within such limits to build large air fleets. Rearmament accelerated after the Abyssinian crisis and the formal remilitarization of Germany in 1935, though in the British case it had begun even before Hitler came to power. A second expansion came in the wake of Munich, particularly for the non-fascist powers. In reply to this crisis Roosevelt announced that ‘neither we, nor any nation, will accept disarmament while neighbor countries arm to the teeth’. His immediate response was to authorize in November 1938 the beginnings of American rearmament with a provisional programme of 30,000 aircraft, a figure subsequently reduced because of the hostility of Congress.®8 The Soviet Union, alarmed more seriously by Japanese expansion, introduced plans early in 1939 to expand air forces to over three times their size in 1933.52  Air rearmament was, however, a more complicated affair than simply expanding numbers. Numbers had to be related to performance, and a balance kept between quantity and quality. Technical changes in aircraft had reached a critical point by the mid-1930s, reflected in the symbolic switch from biplanes to monoplanes. This change
