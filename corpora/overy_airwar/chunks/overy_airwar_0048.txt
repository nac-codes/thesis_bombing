This change was reflected in the rearmament programmes. Germany planned a special stage of conversion (Umbau) for the air force in 1938-39 that temporarily reduced the number of aircraft and left the Luftwaffe weaker in early 1939 than it had been in early 1938 as older aircraft were scrapped from the squadrons.”° The RAF began a similar phase of conversion between 1938 and 1941, again with the effect of temporarily weakening defences by too great a reliance on old models while the new ones were being tested and phased in. For much of this period combatant powers everywhere progressively removed more obsolescent aircraft from the front- line and put them into reserve or in training schools. Front-line aircraft of the most modern quality were small in number in most air forces even by 1939 and an air war fought in the early part of the year would have found most air forces poorly prepared in terms of reserves and in terms of aircraft quality. Another problem was that of deciding the right proportion between aircraft of different types in an air force. This depended on changes in a
