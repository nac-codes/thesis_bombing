ared in terms of reserves and in terms of aircraft quality. Another problem was that of deciding the right proportion between aircraft of different types in an air force. This depended on changes in air doctrine. For example the interest of the French army in ground-support aviation meant that 37 per cent of the production planned in the first rearmament ‘Plan I’ was made up of reconnaissance aircraft.” In Britain, on the other hand, the central position of bombing in RAF strategy gave a preponderant position to bomber production. Between 1936 and 1939 2.3 bombers were produced for every fighter. The Luftwaffe too began by planning a ratio of two bombers to every fighter in 1936 but by 1939, with the growing emphasis on tactical air striking forces, the ratio had dropped to 1.3:1, a little lower than that in the RAF after 1939.72 The trend towards greater fighter production reflected the increasing technical superiority of Page 28 of 309 8% expenditure between 1934-35 and 1938-39. In Britain the RAF took 36 per cent of expenditure in 1938, rising to 41 per cent in 1939.® In both cases efforts were made to force the air service to take favour of the demands of the army.” their size in 1933.6 fighters over bombers and the growing realization that the potential of bomber aircraft had been exaggerated.

In Britain, on the other hand, the central position of bombing in RAF strategy gave a preponderant position to bomber production. Some biplanes survived the whole war. The British ‘Swordfish’, seen here armed with modern rocket weaponry, gave sturdy service in the war at sea. Imperial War Museum  It is difficult to compare figures for aircraft rearmament in simple numerical terms, for the quality of aircraft differed so much from country to country. What was a front-line aircraft in one air force was obsolescent in another. Moreover the effectiveness of an air force depended on which enemy it wa
