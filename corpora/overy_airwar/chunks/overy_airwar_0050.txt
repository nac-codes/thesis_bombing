aircraft differed so much from country to country. What was a front-line aircraft in one air force was obsolescent in another. Moreover the effectiveness of an air force depended on which enemy it was fighting. A comparatively obsolescent aircraft of the Polish air force would, for example, have been of little value in a combat with the Luftwaffe but would have been more than equal to a war with Finland or Hungary. Nor do simple current output figures indicate long-term plans or the ability of an aircraft industry to convert to war production after mobilization. With such qualifications borne in mind Table 1 gives figures for aircraft production, where known, of the major powers before 1939.73  Table 1: Aircraft Production of the Major Powers 1932-3974  France Germany  Italy Japan  Page 30 of 309 9% Table 1: Aircraft Production of the Major Powers 1932-3924 1932 1939 France - 3,163 Germany 36 8,295 Italy 1,750 Japan 691 4,467 U.K. 445 7,940 U.S.A. 593 2,195 U.S.S.R. 2,595 10,382 Nor was rearmament confined simply to aircraft. Static defences also consumed considerable production and planning effort, particularly in Germany where greater emphasis was placed on anti- aircraft artillery. By 1939 Germany had available some 650 heavy batteries with 2,600 guns and 560 light batteries of anti-aircraft guns with 188 searchlight batteries of 3,000 lights, quantities considerably in excess of those of any other power.?5 In Britain and France production difficulties, due partly to the greater effort and urgency devoted to aircraft, held up the expansion of static defences. By spring of 1939 only 570 heavy guns were available in Britain, some 45 per cent only of the Ideal Plan formulated in 1937 for 1,264 heavy guns and 4,700 lights. In fact the 1937 plan was not fulfilled until the Battle of Britain by which time even higher plans had been laid.”® The French situation was the same. Equipment was old and in small numbers with only a few hundred, mainly light, anti-aircraft gun
