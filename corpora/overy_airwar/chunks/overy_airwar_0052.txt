aviation equipment. By 1939 the Spitfire took two and a half times the man hours that it took to produce a Hurricane fighter.278 Moreover those countries that had allowed air forces to decline numerically or, like Germany, had been prohibited from keeping large air forces, had the task of building up a large industrial and organizational structure for air rearmament in a very short space of time. Only the Soviet Union had been building up continuously a large aircraft industry since the 1920s and although backward in some respects industrially, was the largest air power in the world throughout the 1930s. Moreover central control over the industrial system made it easier to integrate military and economic planning than in western countries where a balance had to be struck between war preparation and commercial expansion.” In the west large plans were laid either to allay public fears or to exaggerate military preparedness and such plans ran invariably ahead of the ability to fulfil them. In fact the anxiety of governments chasing a quick air capability led to atemptation to put everything into the ‘shop window’. Both Baldwin and Chamberlain found themselves in that situation, forced on occasion to go against the interests of the air staff to appease the voters. So much so that the Air Member for Supply complained in September 1938 that ‘We had during the past few years been building up a front line Air Force which was nothing but a facade. We had nothing in the way of reserves or organization behind the front-line with which to maintain it’ 8° Hitler, too, in order to gain the maximum effect abroad of the German rearmament drive, created an air force that appeared numerically strong on paper but still lacked by 1938-39 much of the essential material and organizational background and whose numbers were swollen by including transport, trainer and converted aircraft of doubtful usefulness. The ‘Risikoluftwaffe’ was always in fact weaker than its enemies believed.®! Aft
