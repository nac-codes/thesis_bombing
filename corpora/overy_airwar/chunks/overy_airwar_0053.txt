ackground and whose numbers were swollen by including transport, trainer and converted aircraft of doubtful usefulness. The ‘Risikoluftwaffe’ was always in fact weaker than its enemies believed.®! After the war Erhard Milch, head of the German air ministry, complained that ‘the Luftwaffe was not prepared for a major war in 1939... the plans envisaged were scheduled for completion in six or eight years... about 1944-46’.82 Such a view was confirmed by the German air leaders themselves in 1938 and 1939 when active preparation for a future war was undertaken and the shortcomings of the air force made more public.83 The value of the German air force, like that of most other air forces, was as a deterrent rather than as a weapon ready for major strategic operations against strong enemies.  Another problem with rearmament and strategy was the extent to which the decisions taken in both depended upon intelligence of enemy intentions. Except in areas such as anti-aircraft defences where requirements were self-evident, much of the arms effort and the strategy that accompanied it depended on what one power believed another to be doing or planning to do. Before 1939 the western allies tended to overestimate German strength, the Germans to underestimate that of the allies. Fear of German rearmament produced a popular belief that Germany already possessed an air force larger than Britain by 1935, a view fed by uncritical intelligence to politicians such as Churchill and civil servants such as Vansittart who used the information to turn the British government to a policy of rearmament directed against Germany.®4 Although the figures used about Luftwaffe strength were considerably exaggerated, failing to take account of the large number of training aircraft currently in production in Germany or of the number of obsolescent civilian aircraft converted to war use, even the RAF expected the German air force to be expanded faster and further than was in fact the case.
