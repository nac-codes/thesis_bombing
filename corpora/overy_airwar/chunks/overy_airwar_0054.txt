Germany or of the number of obsolescent civilian aircraft converted to war use, even the RAF expected the German air force to be expanded faster and further than was in fact the case. This view was not based on poor information on current production, which tended to be accurate enough before 1939, but on what Germany might produce when mobilized.®> British and French air planning took place on the basis that German aircraft production would expand enormously on the outbreak of war, while the belief that Germany had a large fleet of bombers ready to not fulfilled until the Battle of Britain by which time even higher plans had been laid.76 The French situation was the same. Equipment was old and in small numbers with only a few hundred, mainly man hours that it took to produce a Hurricane fighter.78 Moreover those countries that had allowed air forces to decline numerically or, like Germany, had been prohibited from keeping large air forces, led to a temptation to put everything into the ‘shop window’. Both Baldwin and Chamberlain found themselves in that situation, forced on occasion to go against the interests of the air staff to appease We had nothing in the way of reserves or organization behind the front-line with which to maintain it’.£° Hitler, too, in order to gain the maximum effect abroad of the German rearmament drive, confirmed by the German air leaders themselves in 1938 and 1939 when active preparation for a future war was undertaken and the shortcomings of the air force made more public.®3 The value of a policy of rearmament directed against Germany.*4 Although the figures used about Luftwaffe strength were considerably exaggerated, failing to take account of the large number of training aircraft fact the case. This view was not based on poor information on current production, which tended to be accurate enough before 1939, but on what Germany might produce when mobilized.5 British One of the main explanations for this disparity lay in the German failur
