current production, which tended to be accurate enough before 1939, but on what Germany might produce when mobilized.5 British One of the main explanations for this disparity lay in the German failure to discover the true state of Allied preparations. Believing the Allies to be producing far fewer aircraft than was in fact the case encouraged a complacent belief that German plans were more than sufficient for the immediate future. Intelligence reports in 1938 and 1939 dismissed French and Soviet air forces on the one hand because production was too small, on the other because they were believed to be technically and tactically inferior.8” The British air force was seen as the greatest threat, but British industrial potential and defensive capabilities were both considerably underrated. As late as May 1939 German air intelligence believed Britain capable of producing only 3,000 aircraft during the next year, when the true figure was over three times as great.88 Such over-confidence tended to undermine further attempts to strengthen the Luftwaffe at just the time that its likely enemies were renewing efforts to erode its lead.  Germany was in fact relatively weaker in the air than her enemies believed in 1939, and the Allies correspondingly stronger. The balance of forces shifted somewhat in Germany’s favour with the conquest of Czechoslovakia, many of whose aircraft were brought into the Luftwaffe in subsidiary roles, freeing production resources in the Reich for combat production. But at the time of Munich and at the outbreak of war in September 1939 the Allies had more first-line aircraft than Germany and considerably larger reserves.82 German first-line aircraft were of a higher technical quality than those of the Allies. hut the sreat disnaritv of forces helieved to have existed in the air was a mvth (see Table 7)  pill, dAlltimallelall SULIS AVALLADIE DY L797.
