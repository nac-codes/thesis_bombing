German air staff planning was based on the belief that war would not break out until at least 1942 and was circumscribed by the amount of industrial capacity still left for use after the outbreak of war, which was believed to be little, given existing raw material difficulties. Even when war broke out the Luftwaffe remained trapped in the planning schedules produced by Milch in 1936 which were little above peace-time levels of output.21 The RAF, by contrast, still in the expectation that German output would similarly expand during the war, planned to increase production 100 per cent in the first year of war, and another 100 per cent the following year.
