were little above peace-time levels of output.2! The RAF, by contrast, still in the British ‘War Potential’ programme projected an output in 1940 of 16,000 aircraft, the first German wartime plan, Plan 16, called for 11,000.22 Had the Luftwaffe been brought more fully into Hitler’s confidence the level of preparation would perhaps have been higher. As it was throughout the summer of 1939 there prevailed uncertainty about the kind of war to prepare for and if war would break out at all, made more uncertain by Goering’s personal conviction that Hitler would not dare to risk war against the western powers under the conditions of 1939.93 Yet it was as a result of Goering’s own uncritical optimism, and his desire to please Hitler by representing the Luftwaffe as a force much stronger than was the case, that Hitler moved one step nearer to accelerating his foreign policy initiatives, confident himself of the superiority of his arms.
