German air staff planning was based on the belief that war would not brea out at all, made more uncertain by Goering’s personal conviction that Hitler would not dare to risk war against the western powers under the conditions of 1939.23 Yet it was as a result of Goering’s the crucial years of preparation.®4 So, too, did the conflict within French strategy between army and air force views of air power which made it difficult to select weapons and held up the introduction of aircraft of the highest quality. Further delays in development occurred as a result of the decision to separate air force procurement from design and development, giving the air force little say in choosing its weapons and antagonizing both manufacturers and professional airmen.25 These were problems not unknown elsewhere but coming as they did together with a more deep-rooted military and political crisis, French efforts at air rearmament were continuously frustrated by events. Even then the three powers that found themselves at war with Germany in 1939 were much closer to German air power than the outcome of the Battle of France might suggest. It was the German army more than the German air force that exposed the very considerable gap in military capability that separated Germany from the Allies. At the time, however, many of the weaknesses of both sides were unknown to the other. In the hope that an air war might not break out at all, and the untried weapon not be tested, efforts continued throughout the 1930s at reaching agreement on multilateral air disarmament.2 Nor was such an effort confined just to the democracies. Hitler, anxious to make every effort to avoid the bombing of German civilians which he feared might bring a second ‘stab-in-the-back’, expressed to Eden and Simon in 1935 his view that ‘the German government particularly like
