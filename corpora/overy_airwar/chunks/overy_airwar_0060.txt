The Malkin Committee set up in Britain in 1938 to study the possibility reached the conclusion that any quid pro quo demanded by other powers would be too costly to Britain’s strategic position.22 Germany felt too insecure in the face of the Soviet presence to risk disarming. Von Ribbentrop told the British ambassador in 1938 that ‘even if the Soviet Union declared itself ready to refrain from the use of bombs, it would be impossible to place any faith in such a declaration’.1°° Thus by 1939 the situation had been reached where both sides possessed considerable bombing forces to deter the other from using them for terror bombing attacks. On the eve of war Hitler announced that he would restrict bombing to military targets only, and Goering asked Dahlerus to convey to the British that if the RAF would do the same the Luftwaffe would  Page 33 of 309 10% British ‘War Potential’ programme projected an output in 1940 of 16,000 aircraft, the first German wartime plan, Plan 16, called for 11,000.92 Had the Luftwaffe been brought more fully into Hitler’s the crucial years of preparation.%4 So, too, did the conflict within French strategy between army and air force views of air power which made it difficult to select weapons and held up the introduction in choosing its weapons and antagonizing both manufacturers and professional airmen. These were problems not unknown elsewhere but coming as they did together with a more deep-rooted cont
