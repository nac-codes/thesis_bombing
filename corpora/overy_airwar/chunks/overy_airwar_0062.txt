emical and biological warfare. Plans were elaborated for the evacuation of urban areas and the dispersal of industry. A general programme of education in air raid protection was begun all over Europe.1 In Russia a policy was followed from the 1920s of creating cadres of trained men and women capable of restraining panic in the face of attack and of restoring essential services. Each cadre was based on an individual factory or residential block.1% In Germany the Reich’s Air Defence League (Reichsluftschutzbund) trained some 12 million Germans in elementary passive air defence, and provided advanced courses of 26 weeks training to those entrusted with civil defence organization.1°° By 1939 the British Government, while providing free air raid precaution information and training, became the only government to supply every member of the population with a gas mask.12 Air raid shelters were built in all major cities and air raid building regulations became statutory requirements in most major European countries during the 1930s. The enthusiasm for civil defence preparations reflected a general fear that however good the active defences or however powerful the deterrent quality of bomber fleets, a policy of unrestricted bombing would be too tempting a weapon for any combatant to lightly abandon it. The experiences of Abyssinia, Spain and China were seen as pointers to the effects of an air war between even more powerful air rivals. If air commanders were more critical of air power than the public, sufficient uncertaintv existed as to the scone of the air force in war to warrant both anxietv and optimism at the same time when that war finallv broke out in Seotember 1939. out until at east 1742 alld Was Circurmscribed by the amount OF indaustrial Capacity still tert ror use alter the Outbreak OF Wal, WiliChi Was Delleved CO DE Little, Piven existing raw Ilaterlal AUTICutles, Even when war broke out the Luftwaffe remained trapped in the planning schedules produced by Milch in
