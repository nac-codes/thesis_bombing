arations demonstrated the hollowness of the threat of air power, used on its own, the politicians’ reluctance to strike the first blow was given a pragmatic justification. Not only were the technical means to hand unsuitable for a sustained and effective bombing campaign, but the air crews lacked training; and the air staffs had not yet prepared a strategy in detail for the independent use of aircraft. As a result aircraft remained at first, for both sides, auxiliary to the army and navy, while retaining the promise that technical improvements would give air power a more decisive role at a future date. This situation worried Hitler less than the Allies because co-operation with the army, with its emphasis on dive-bombing and battle aircraft, remained central to his strategy. There was no question, despite Goering’s boasts, that a German strategic bombing campaign could be launched in 1939 with any prospect of success. In the event co-operation between the Luftwaffe and the army proved to be a vital factor in German victory.

The manoeuvres, while exciting a considerable amount of anxiety among the air staff as to the poor state of training and operational preparedness, were carried out along the lines predicted in earlier contingency planning. The Luftwaffe was to destroy the Polish ai
