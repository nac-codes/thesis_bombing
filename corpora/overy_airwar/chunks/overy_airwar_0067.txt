mong the air staff as to the poor state of training and operational preparedness, were carried out along the lines predicted in earlier contingency planning. The Luftwaffe was to destroy the Polish air force by attacks against airfields and then turn to give close tactical support to the attacking armies. This intention was given substance in Hitler’s first war directive.1° Hitler also asked that operational preparations for attacks by air against England should be worked out but the result was disappointing. It was concluded that there would be great difficulty and little chance of success in waging an independent air war against Britain in the immediate future.1%  The same conclusion had been reached by a different route in the Western Allies’ planning. Direct preparations for a possible war against Germany had been begun after the occupation of rump Czechoslovakia. Uppermost in the minds of both the French and British supreme commands was the desire not to initiate anything that could be interpreted as unrestricted bombing. The major task of the bomber forces was to help as far as was possible in the event of attack by Germany over land or in retaliation for air attacks by enemy bombers but at all events to try to conserve and expand forces that were ill-prepared for such a campaign in September 1939.10 French leaders remained consistently opposed to the use of bombers on strategic tasks, particularly the attack against the Ruhr, and insisted that bombers be used to attack enemy columns and hold up the enemy advance.1!! The RAF retained in its planning the use of bombers in strategic attacks with a maximum striking force only if there appeared to be imminent danger of total defeat. For the carrying out of these and other priorities the RAF had produced by the end of 1939 a list of fourteen tasks under the Western Air Plans which were sufficiently flexible to allow rapid switch of priority should the need arise. The major task was defensive.112 The French air forc
