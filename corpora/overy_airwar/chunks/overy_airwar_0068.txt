In order to co-ordinate the different aspects of allied air strategy an Allied Central Air Bureau was established designed to work closely with the supreme command organization under Gamelin who was able to insist that air forces should follow the French interest rather than the British in any effort to repulse a German attack. Preparations of a broad strategic nature were finalized in November 1939 under the heading Plan D, the plan to move French and British armies as quickly as possible into Belgium to form a defensive line on the rivers that would link up with actual fortifications in France.
