the state of air technology, which conditioned the strategic choices open to both sides. The lack of heavy bombers, or of bombers fast enough to avoid fighter defences, or of bombing aids accurate enough for economic warfare restricted air forces, and particularly the RAF, to carrying out very little. The second factor was the supply of aircraft. Of the Western powers’ aircraft a large proportion were obsolete or becoming so and were to be replaced by newer types still at the testing stage or only coming in small quantities from the factories. British planning assumed the need for the eventual production of 2,000 to 3,000 aircraft a month after 18 months of war. The first year of war under the Harrogate programme published in January 1940 was to aim for 1,700 aircraft a month by September 1940, sufficient to meet the needs of a wartime establishment of 360 squadrons.144 French intentions were much more modest. Plan V, the past pre-war programme, had called for an output of 330 aircraft a month by early 1940. When war broke out the war mobilization plan aimed for 780 Page 36 of 309 10% justification.

This intention was given substance in Hitler’s first war directive.1°8 Hitler also asked that operational preparations for attacks by air against England should be worked out but the result was disappointing. It was concluded that there would be great difficulty and little chance of success in waging an independent air war against Britain in the immediate future.10 of the bomber forces was to help as far as was possible in the event of attack by Germany over land or in retaliation for air attacks by enemy bombers but at all events to try to conserve and expand. forces that were ill-prepared for such a campaign in September 1939.11° French leaders remaine
