This was effectively the plan that was to go into operation in the battle for France six months later.113 the Harrogate programme published in January 1940 was to aim for 1,700 aircraft a month by September 1940, sufficient to meet the needs of a wartime establishment of 360 squadrons.1!4 French aircraft a month by the seventh month of war, although more ambitious plans were laid for a war of longer duration.115 The immediate mobilization plans for the Luftwaffe did not reflect the same sense of urgency as those of the Allies, partly because of industrial restrictions and unsatisfactory planning, partly because of the over-confidence of the leadership secure in possessing in 1939 the larger and more effective air force. The first mobilization plan aimed for a production of 1,040 aircraft per month of all types by the end of the first year of war, with a long-term aim of producing an average of 1,100-1,200 a month for a war of three years duration. Successive plans revised these totals downwards to a planned monthly production of 1,000 a month until 1942.116 British monthly production thus began to exceed that of Germany in the course of 1939. French production totalled 2,113 aircraft for the first five months of 1940, giving the Allies an advantage in the supply of aircraft of almost two to one.1!2 Moreover Britain and France were able to call on the aircraft manufacturing capacity of the United States, which, despite the political arguments over the question of neutrality, proved willing to supply large quantities of aircraft. By September 1939 orders for 1,500 had been gi
