333 Polish aircraft.112 Between the defeat of Poland and the campaign in France there was relatively little air activity. Hitler directed that the air force limit its operations to attacks on shipping and reconnaissance work in order to conserve forces for the major offensive and to reduce the risk of starting an unrestricted air bombing war. Plans were laid in reluctant co-operation with the German navy for attacks on Britain’s trade and ports but the attack was postponed until after the Western army offensive.!2° Allied air activity confined itself to intelligence work and propaganda from the air.  The campaign in Norway and Denmark marked the first real air activity of the war in the west although the commitment of air forces was limited, particularly for the Allies, by the demands in the main theatre of war. The Luftwaffe gained air superiority by virtue of the larger numbers diverted to the operations and the advantage, after the occupation of Denmark, of internal lines of communication over land with good air bases against the Allies’ difficulty in flying from distant bases over sea in hazardous conditions. If the campaign demonstrated anything it was the failure of both sides to prepare for effective air-sea co-operation, symbolized by the sinking of two German destroyers by the Luftwaffe. Both sides were persuaded of the importance of air support for ground forces, if such persuasion were needed. On observing German success with close-support aircraft the British air minister commented that ‘strong air power must be met by stronger air power’ while, as in Poland, the German army was confirmed in the wisdom of tying the aircraft to a tactical role with the army. Again Luftwaffe losses, against light opposition, were high: some 242 aircraft were LO WOLK CLOSELY WIUTL ULE SUPLEIMME COMMMANG OLEAlliazdliOl UlGEL GAalleilli Wi1O Was ADIE LO Ilsist Uildal all LOLCEs SHlOUIG LOMOW LIE Fee) IELe st LALLer Ullal) Lie Diitisih iil ally CitOLre LO LEPulse a aircraft a
