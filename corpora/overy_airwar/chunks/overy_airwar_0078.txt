Both strategies were soon to be subordinated to the new goal of moving east against Soviet Russia, a decision that Hitler reached before he knew finallv whether or not the British would seek a veace.126 Both the alternatives against Britain necessitated the use of air forces as an anti-trade weapon in co-overation with the Navv or in prevaring rr ee a OO i ii, ee i an ae ee a EE OS finally whether or not the British would seek a peace.126 Both the alternatives against Britain necessitated the use of air forces as an anti-trade weapon in co-operation with the Navy or in preparing the ground for any invasion by defeating the RAF.

By 2 July Hitler asked the services to provide contingency plans for the invasion of Britain but made no final decision.
