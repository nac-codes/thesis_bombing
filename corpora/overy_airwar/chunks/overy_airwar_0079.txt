win mastery in the air without which no invasion would be possible. For the first time the air forces were to be launched on a major strategic operation for which there had been little preparation and little experience. The plan was not, however, to win the war with the air force alone. The battle for which Hitler was preparing was an enlarged version of the attack on France.

If the Battle of Britain tested the German
