ly.13°  For the British the situation that developed after the fall of France was exactly the contingency for which preparations had been in hand since 1937. If the Battle of Britain tested the German ability to undertake a strategic air campaign it was also a test of the major strand of British air doctrine, the provision of adequate aerial defence against the air attack. The advantage lay very much with the defender since the equipment and organization of Fighter Command was for the express purpose of preventing enemy air attack. The equipment and preparation of the Luftwaffe was hardly adequate since such a campaign had not been an important part of German air planning. There was no heavy bomber capable of carrying large loads over long-range. Fighters were not long-range and the heavier fighters and dive-bombing aircraft were produced for the main purpose of supporting ground troops in battle, not guarding bomber groups or attacking well-defended airfields. Finally, i re ee finally whether or not the British would seek a peace.12° Both the alternatives against Britain necessitated the use of air forces as an anti-trade weapon in co-operation with the Navy or in preparing September during which time Hitler finally recognized that air superiority of the kind required could not be achieved and postponed the invasion indefinitely.12° there was no real operational experience of combating an enemy equipped with a comprehensive early warning system and centralized communications and command systems. The technical and organizational advantages enjoyed by the RAF could only have been overcome by massive bomber attacks for which the Germans were ill-prepared or by overwhelming numerical superiority, which the Luftwaffe lacked.131  It was on this question of numbers that the Luftwaffe made its major mistakes, both in estimating the strength of the British air forces and in deciding the necessary level of supply for its own forces. Goering relied on information from his chi
