Moreover the very strategy of overwhelming an air force in a single ‘battle’ betrayed the Luftwaffe’s failure to grasp that air superiority could not be absolute against a well-armed enemy with large economic resources, a fact that had been widely misunderstood amongst the pre-war air powers. It was impossible under the conditions of the summer of 1940 for the Luftwaffe to eliminate the RAF because it lacked the operational and material means to destroy the British aircraft industry — in fact air attacks spurred on the industrial effort — or to prevent the RAF from regrouping again for renewed combat over the contested area. Poor German intelligence coupled with a complete lack of urgency in the question of production and repair had a crucial part to play in the failure of the Battle of Britain. Douhet’s contention that air command could be considered won when one side was forced on to a permanent defensive in air warfare was finally confounded. The Luftwaffe was, of course, able to inflict heavy losses on the RAF in both pilots and aircraft. Lack of combat training and the inadequacy of early British fighter tactics contributed to this. But it should be remembered that the RAF sustained higher losses in the seven weeks of the Battle of France than in the whole period of the Battle of Britain. In many ways the battles in May and June were more critical for the survival of the RAF than the attacks in August and September 1940. In these attacks the Luftwaffe was caught in an operational cleft stick. Attacks by bombers by day had to be escorted by large numbers of fighters. The early attacks by fighter-bombers and
