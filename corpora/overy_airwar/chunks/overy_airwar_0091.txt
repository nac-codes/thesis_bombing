also attacked. The resistance among the Luftwaffe junior officers to mere terror raids meant that unless Hitler or Goering specifically asked for retaliation, the bombing campaign was directed against military and economic targets as originally intended. Hitler himself complained later of the ineffectiveness of such a programme. ‘The munitions industry... he said ‘cannot be interfered with effectively therefore, Hitler inst make one last attempt to bring Britain to defeat in 1940. For the first time the Luftwaffe was to be given the task of bringing the war to an end by the exercise less satisfactory.444 by air raids. We learned that lesson in the autumn of 1940... usually the prescribed targets are not hit; often the fliers unload their bombs on fields camouflaged as plants; and in both countries the armaments industry is so decentralized that the armament potential cannot really be interfered with....147  The Blitz finally ended in the spring of 1941. Nothing had changed since 1940 as a result of the campaign except that the Luftwaffe was more than ever persuaded of the advantages of a tactical role for air forces. The theories of Douhet seemed doubly confounded. Fighter defence had proved an active and effective deterrent by day. Technical shortcomings and poor planning had contributed to the failure to achieve any decisive result through bombing alone. The Blitz had anyway long dropped out of Hitler’s main strategic thinking. Aircraft needed to be conserved for the coming attack against Russia, for the problem of aircraft supply had not yet been solved and the winter and spring of 1940-41 still found the Luftwaffe producing well below its planned output. In January aircraft production sank to 635 for all types, just over 50 per cent of the planned number. Moreover the temporary priority won by aircraft production in the armaments economy after June was rescinded by Hitler in late September 1940 and a renewed effort made with army armament to meet the requiremen
