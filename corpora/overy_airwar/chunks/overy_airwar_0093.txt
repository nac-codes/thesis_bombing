thin the foreseeable future’.142 Air force co-operation with the navy had never been good, however. The naval air forces were small and poorly equipped and Goering jealously guarded his command over all Luftwaffe units that might be compelled to support naval operations. Nevertheless the far-ranging Kondor aircraft in co-operation with submarines achieved remarkable successes in the early stages of the campaign,1"° partly because the British convoy system had not yet been fully organized; partly because Coastal and Bomber Command had not prepared for a major air-navy war of the kind now required. But once such preparations were in hand it became a relatively easy matter to restrict the impact of German aircraft on British shipping; with the improved weapons of Coastal Command the threat from the submarine and surface raider was also substantially (if temporarily) reduced. The German navy remained starved of enough resources in aircraft. The mine-laying campaign which promised considerable success ground to a halt because Goering would not release enough aircraft for the task. Torpedo development was well behind that of the other combatants because of the lack of interest shown in naval co-operation during the 1930s. No delayed fuse torpedoes were available in 1940 and fuses had to be purchased from Italy. Conventional bombers had to be converted to the task and such a conversion took time. Not that conventional bombers had a sufficient range, for the Navy needed a long-range heavy bomber built for the purpose. The Kondor was in fact a converted airliner and transport plane and could not hope to compete with the modern fighter aircraft it opposed. Finally the German Navy possessed no aircraft carriers that would have allowed greater tactical flexibility in choosing where to concentrate the aerial attacks on shipping.151  Blockade failed like the Blitz and the Battle of Britain through the lack of preparation for such strategic employment and the rapid ability of the
