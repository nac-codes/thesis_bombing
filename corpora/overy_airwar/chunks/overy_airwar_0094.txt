The failure of the Luftwaffe in the autumn and winter of 1940-41 marked the high-watermark of German air strategy. Thereafter the air force was to play a vital but mainly tactical role. In this capacity it had more than proved its value, justifying the faith in the dive-bomber and the tactics of close support for ground troops championed by Jeschonnek and the German air staff. The lesson that the German high command drew from the experience of 1940 was that ‘air strategy’ as distinct from a ‘combined strategy’ was a delusion.
