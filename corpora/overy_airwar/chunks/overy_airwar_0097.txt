e inadequate for the major tasks, although efforts were made to improve the bomb itself. Finally there were no effective navigational aids introduced even though scientific intelligence had already located and described the German aids and prepared ways of defeating them. Despite these drawbacks the Air Staff continued to press for precision bombing and concentration on synthetic oil plants.154 The Prime Minister and Cabinet took a different view. On the basis of the evidence that targets could not be easily destroyed by night bombing, the War Cabinet insisted that ‘whilst we should adhere to the rule that our objectives should be military targets, at the same time the civilian population around the target areas must be made to feel the weight of the war’.155 Such an ambiguous statement emerged as a directive to the Commander of Bomber Command to start ‘harassing the enemy’s main industrial towns and communications’ when the attack on oil could not be carried out. As it happened a general harassment was all Bomber Command had been operationally capable of. Photographic evidence showed that the targets claimed as destroyed were often not hit at all. These were all lessons which were easily available from the failure of  a aad 1  Page 47 of 309 15% at the same time the civilian population around the target areas must be made to feel the weight of the war’.455 Such an ambiguous statement emerged as a directive to the Commander of Bomber German night bombing. During the first six months of 1941 the Government’s growing concern with the ineffectiveness of bombing and the indecisiveness of its strategy coincided with the gradual acceptance by the airmen that they lacked the operational means to do more than simply bomb cities and communications more or less indiscriminately. Such a situation paved the way for the development of area bombing, a strategy arrived at by a process of elimination. Only Churchill seemed genuinely convinced that area bombing would be capable of c
