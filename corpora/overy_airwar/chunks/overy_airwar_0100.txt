ere was less success with the war against the submarine even after air command had been won over the sea because of the need for advanced radar detection equipment, but even in submarine warfare a temporary fall in shipping losses was secured by better patrolling of the seas within aircraft range which forced the submarines to shift the battleground to the mid-Atlantic.152 In these changes in the Atlantic battle the use of bombers and carriers was crucial. The diversion of sufficient heavy aircraft from bombing Germany to bombing German naval targets and for patrolling purposes, while it led to a reduction in the bombing attacks on Germany itself, provided a weapon against which the German navy and air force were themselves ill-prepared. The same was true of the introduction of escort carriers. An ambitious carrier programme was begun when it was realized that aircraft would be needed to help protect the large convoys. They were brought into operation from September 1941 and within a short period of time eliminated the threat from the Kondor aircraft which had no long-range supporting aircraft to give them protection.1© In response to these changes in organization and weapons the German navy demanded throughout 1941 that the Luftwaffe provide more assistance in mine-laying and in general support of naval operations. The stumbling block to this policy was not a shortage of resources, as Goering argued, but the fact that Goering would not relinquish control over the Luftwaffe in the way that operational control over Coastal Command in direct support of naval activity had been granted in March 1941. Since Hitler agreed with Goering over the question of indivisibility and since Goering gave little credence to the view that the air war at sea could achieve anything decisive, the German navy was starved of resources that might otherwise have been used to great effect in the spirit of Hitler’s rather hollow directive ‘to concentrate all the weapons of air and sea warfare a
