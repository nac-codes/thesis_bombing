From June onwards anything that could be spared was pressed into service in the Middle East.168 Not until October, however, could the government comply realistically with the demands for reinforcement, particularly re-equipment with modern types, and not until the middle of 1941 was the help sustained and significant. Before then the valuable resources of modern aircraft that were released to the Middle East were used in a primarily defensive and reconnaissance role. There were not enough aircraft available to do more. The only independent operations were carried out by bombers and torpedo-bombers against Italian shipping, which, despite their small numbers, were able to cripple the Italian fleet at Taranto due to good use of intelligence and poor Italian defences. The combined use of aircraft with the other services gave the British the first real opportunity of testing the tactical use of air power. The naval war, and in particular the use of aircraft carriers, anticipated the experience of successful aero-naval co-operation in the Atlantic and the Pacific.1©° Fewer mistakes were made than had been exhibited in the Norwegian campaign or the early stages of the northern naval war. The early use of aircraft in the desert and the East African campaign anticipated the use to which tactical air power was to be put in the campaigns from 1942 onwards. In both cases, however, the tactical achievement was compromised by poor supply and poor maintenance. Any appearance of success came through the greater weakness of Italy’s colonial and naval  Caen nk we ee ed tet a nett oni in---- MEET a meee alan ee Tha ine mee tht ee a ee fa ot Ble pee tee REL REL ods cern et man ee dist A cet tees od ao ot dn Si SS Se Seeks FE RE ee Slee ee eee SERS SS SRE SE Ee SR eS Be EE ee ee Se eee OS AE ek ee She  Italian strength on paper looked impr
