It was only at this point that Hitler was forced to commit German air forces to a second front to redeem the disasters of his ally’s independent policy.17°  The British reaction to the new threat was to build up the supply of aircraft and equipment to produce an aerial defence similar to the one that had worked so well in England in the autumn of 1940. By September 1941 more fighters were available in Egypt than had been available in England at the beginning of the Battle of Britain. Moreover the Italian and German air forces continued to  be considerably under-supplied. For East Africa only 75 additional aircraft were made available for the Italian air forces in the period from June 1940 to the end o  the campaign. Some 250 aircraft  were destroyed in the area and the remaining 200 were unserviceable owing to a shortage of parts, fuel and trained maintenance men.!“ In North Africa on the eve of Graziani’s offensive, General  Porro had approximately 300 serviceable combat aircraft of all types which were rapidly whittled away through poor supply, maintenance and non-combat wastage.1”2 Very little new material was made available from Italy. The disparity in numbers also rendered the impact of the Luftwaffe Fliegerkorps X increasingly half-hearted and ineffective. The British emphasis on supply and material superiority was underlined by the importance in overall strategy attached to the long air supply route to the Middle East and to the improvement in the maintenance of those aircraft that arrived at 17% anticipated the experience of successful aero-naval co-operation in the Atlantic and the Pacific.1©2 Fewer mistakes were made than had been exhibited in the Norwegian campaign or the early stages down. East Africa was lost, with the loss of almost all Italy’s colonial air forces of over 400 aircraft. The initial thrust by Graziani along the road to Egypt was repulsed and a successful British counter- offensive drove the Italians out of Cyrenaica. It was o
