It was only at this point that Hitler was forced to commit German air forces to a second front to redeem the disasters of his ally’s independent policy.1”° be considerably under-supplied. For East Africa only 75 additional aircraft were made available for the Italian air forces in the period from June 1940 to the end of the campaign. Some 250 aircraft their destination. In both respects the RAF emerged in 1941 with a considerable advantage over the Axis powers that laid the foundation for the successful capture of air superiority in 1942. A special route for aircraft deliveries was established across Africa from Takoradi in the Gold Coast, a route that provided a defensible lifeline for the Egyptian air forces and released valuable shipping space for the supply of valuable fuel and spare parts by the longer route around the Cape.1”3 The realization that many of the new aircraft remained grounded for want of parts or proper maintenance prompted the RAF to establish a Maintenance Group responsible directly to the area commander-in-chief, in charge of maintenance, repair, salvage and stores. The group was given wide responsibilities along the lines of the Maintenance Command set up in Britain to such good effect. As a result not only were more aircraft available to the RAF than to the enemy, but the level of serviceability was also much higher.174 Yet despite the success in building up supplies, in containing the Luftwaffe in the Mediterranean and in breaking Italian air power, the British were unable to bring about the speedy defeat of Rommel. His success in the desert was certainly not due to air supremacy; far from it. The Luftwaffe had had little time to plan for a southern campaign and few resources could be diverted to it away from the main campaign in Russia. Ground organiz
