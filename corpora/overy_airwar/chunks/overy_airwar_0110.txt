not due to air supremacy; far from it. The Luftwaffe had had little time to plan for a southern campaign and few resources could be diverted to it away from the main campaign in Russia. Ground organization was poor in the Balkans. There were very few long-range bombers, which were essential to bring effective damage to the British military build- up in Egypt. Hitler’s enthusiastic directives to the Luftwaffe betrayed an ignorance of its true capability.175 Nursing wounds from the failure of the Blitz, and engaged from June onwards in Russia, the bomber forces were in no condition to provide large numbers of pilots or aircraft for hurried strategic tasks in the south. The main aircraft, the Ju 88, was unsuitable for long-range operations and was a fairly limited weapon against small and scattered targets which were increasingly well-defended by modern fighter aircraft. This was certainly the case in the attacks on Malta which took a heavy Page 52 of 309 17% offensive drove the Italians out of Cyrenaica. It was only at this point that Hitler was forced to commit German air forces to a second front to redeem the disasters of his ally’s independent policy.17° Porro had approximately 300 serviceable combat aircraft of all types which were rapidly whittled away through poor supply, maintenance and non-combat wastage.172 Very little new material was toll of Luftwaffe aircraft for little military advantage.1”6 There were other problems too, not least being the need to co-ordinate Italian and German air planning as well as to integrate air activity into the wider campaign. Neither enterprise was particularly successful, partly because the German and Italian commanders had different priorities. Hitler had achieved his minimum aim in the south with the final expulsion of British forces from Crete. Italian commanders wanted to drive the British out of North Africa and recapture the empire, and although resentful of having to co-operate with German forces were also anxious that
