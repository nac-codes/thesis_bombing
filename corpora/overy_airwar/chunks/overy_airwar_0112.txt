In the Middle East air supremacy passed to the RAF not long after the invasion of Russia and little effort was made to recapture it. Britain was able to draw more extensively on American aid as well. By July 1941 Britain was planning for an air force of 62 1/2 squadrons in the Middle East with initial equipment of 1,046 aircraft. By mid-October 52 of the squadrons were already in being with a strength of 846 aircraft and substantial repair and maintenance facilities. Fliegerkorps down. East Africa was lost, with the loss of almost all Italy's colonial air forces of over 400 aircrait. lhe initial thrust by Graziani along the road to Egypt was repulsed and a successful british counter- offensive drove the Italians out of Cyrenaica. It was only at this point that Hitler was forced to commit German air forces to a second front to redeem the disasters of his ally’s independent policy.172 the main weight of the attack on Britain should be borne by the air forces, centred around a new force of heavy bombers planned for 1942.17” The attack on Russia was planned according to the X, on the other hand, was starved of aircraft as the Russian front expanded. Total strength varied between 400 and 450 aircraft, of which only about 250 were serviceable at any one time — a figure that included only about 30 single-engined fighters.178 This situation was due not just to production priorities in the Reich. The German maintenance network was improvised, and the crews under a heavy strain of fighting throughout the summer of 1941 with insufficient replacements. The Italian commitment was even more meagre. Having lost all the aircraft in East Africa, the North African air force contained only 210 aircraft by the late sum
