f 1941 with insufficient replacements. The Italian commitment was even more meagre. Having lost all the aircraft in East Africa, the North African air force contained only 210 aircraft by the late summer of 1941. There were in addition some 83 Italian aircraft in the Aegean area with a low rate of serviceability.172 The only thing that prevented the RAF from exploiting the local advantage was the fact that the loss of Greece, Crete and Cyrenaica had reduced the number of good air bases from which to be able to strike effectively at the Axis powers from the air. A large number of aircraft helped to safeguard Egypt and the Canal but did not necessarily make it possible to accelerate the return to the offensive in North Africa and the seizure of the new air bases. Only the army could do this and until better co-ordination had been established between army and air force the amount of aid that the RAF could directly bring to bear on army operations was also limited.

(iv) Air Power and War 1939-41  The impact of aircraft on the war in the first two years was both less decisive and less terrible than had been expected before 1939. In combination with
