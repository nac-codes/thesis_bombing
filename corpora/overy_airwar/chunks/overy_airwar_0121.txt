onfidence lay not only with their own battle experience but with estimates that total Red Air Force strength was only 5,500 aircraft of poor quality; that pilot training was well below standards set in the Luftwaffe; and that the Soviet aircraft industry was small, strategically vulnerable and relatively inefficient.183 Some of these impressions of the Soviet Air Force were, to be sure, not unfounded. It was known that large formations of uncamouflaged and undispersed fighter aircraft were stationed on often inadequate airfields close to the frontier openly inviting the kind of massive first strike that the Luftwaffe planned. These represented fundamental tactical errors on the Soviet side.184 It was also known that the quality of Russian aircraft was well below that of Germany, although Russian air forces were in the process of being converted to more modern types as the Luftwaffe had itself been converted in 1939-40. What was underestimated was the production and technical potential of the Soviet aircraft industry and the Russian ability to improvise and reorganize the structure of air forces under the circumstances of a sudden and devastating attack.  The first miscalculation was the more serious one. The Luftwaffe wanted to win supremacy over a wide and increasingly deep battle zone through operations ‘to paralyse and eliminate the effectiveness of the Russian Air Force as far as possible’.185 The directives to the Luftwaffe, however, failed to include any instructions for follow-up attacks to deny the Red Air Force the opportunity to mount a counter-offensive or to continue to reinforce itself from internal supply lines. The ‘paralysing’ of the Red Air Force was only a short-term objective. The longer-term objectives remained undefined. All subsequent directives indicated Hitler’s failure to understand that the winning of air mastery was a continuous operation and that against an enemy like Soviet Russia the ‘knockout blow’ was as inappropriate as it had been a
