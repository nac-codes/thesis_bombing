dicated Hitler’s failure to understand that the winning of air mastery was a continuous operation and that against an enemy like Soviet Russia the ‘knockout blow’ was as inappropriate as it had been against Britain in 1940. Hitler obviously hoped that air command would last long enough to allow the army’s Blitzkrieg to succeed, but such success was not strategically inevitable. As a result of his exaggerated belief in the invincibility of German forces insufficient attention was paid to longer-term strategy or to other contingencies. Since Soviet air strength had been underestimated the need for alternative air strategies was all the more pressing. When it came to the air force, however, Hitler lacked strategic imagination, preferring to use it in close support of the army whose strategy he more fully understood and even to the extent of denying the air force the same degree of freedom in choosing objectives not directly related to the battlefield than it had had in the battle of France and the preparations for Sealion.186 Had the true state of Russian air preparation been known, German air strategy might have been different. Even without this knowledge Hitler was placing undue faith in the ability of air forces to inflict a knockout blow against the Red Air Force, given the size of the Luftwaffe in the East. As it was Russian air rearmament had expanded rapidly. German intelligence estimated that some 5,000 aircraft per annum were produced in 1939 and 1940. In fact Russian sources show that 10,382 were produced in 1939 and 10,565 in 1940.187 In 1941 Russian air forces in the west, including reserves, probably numbered up to 10,000 aircraft, supported by an average monthly production in 1941 of 1,311 aircraft. By mid-1941 some 3,700 of the new aircraft models had been produced and the conversion from existing obsolescent types was well under way, although most of the aircraft stationed at the frontier were older types. The new fighters, Yak-1, MiG-3 and LaGG-3, were
