s were set. These in turn failed to be met by the producers because of poor preparation and formulation of demands from the Luftwaffe staff. Instead of setting high targets and then developing the industry and resources to meet them, Udet and Goering asked industry what it could currently produce and then tailored demands to meet these calculations. In addition the communications gap between Hitler and his air force was extraordinary. Only a low-ranking air force officer worked at the Supreme Headquarters and co-operation between the three services at the highest level was often non-existent.125 Had air production been set more firmly into a wider organizational or political framework such difficulties might have been avoided. Its relative isolation under the jealous guardianship of Goering led to a growing gap in the early years of war between Hitler’s demands and actual air strength. Hitler had demanded a fivefold increase in the air forces in 1938 but had not pursued his demand which in consequence went largely ignored. When Hitler returned to the question of air force supply in mid-1941 he demanded to know what had happened in the interval. The fact was that Goering told Hitler one story and his staff another; boasting of production successes to Hitler but recognizing with his technical staff the impossibility of meeting requirements in the existing economic circumstances. It was not until 1941 when the Luftwaffe was demonstrably under-supplied that Hitler intervened to turn the problem into a crisis.126 By then, however, it was too late to do anything effective for at least a year. New production capacity would take time to set up. In fact Germany was not to start producing at the same rate as Russia until mid-1944 by which time the additional aircraft were of much less strategic use. Had Hitler’s initial requirement been met, however, then the Luftwaffe would have been a much more formidable enemy both in the Battle of Britain and on the eastern front.  As it
