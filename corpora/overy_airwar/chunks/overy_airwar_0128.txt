less strategic use. Had Hitlerâ€™s initial requirement been met, however, then the Luftwaffe would have been a much more formidable enemy both in the Battle of Britain and on the eastern front.  As it was the situation of regular battle attrition that set in from June onwards was precisely the sort of situation that the Luftwaffe needed to avoid. The Russians were particularly anxious to conserve where possible and deliberately put up a weak defence in some places in the knowledge that a particular area or battle was not likely to be decisive. Even by the end of July the Luftwaffe was reduced to 1,045 serviceable machines on the whole of the eastern front.122 By December this was reduced to 500 machines. The supply of the Demyansk pocket promised by Goering although  Page 59 of 309 19% EEE EEE ae. re, ne es expanded continuously, throughout the first half of 1941 aircraft production remained a at the same level. Luftwaffe strength actually declined from a peak reached in March 1940 as the following three services at the highest level was often non-existent.195 Had air production been set more firmly into a wider organizational or political framework such difficulties might have been avoided. Its successful swallowed valuable air resources at this critical moment in air supply. During this operation some 262 Ju 52 transport and supply aircraft were lost at a time when annual production was running at just 500 a year, and in addition training schools and factories in the Reich had been combed for pilots and transport aircraft for the emergency.128 The difficulty in the supply of German aircraft was made worse by the fact that even those aircraft that were available to the Luftwaffe could not be used because of poor servicing and repair. There were a number of reasons why the Luftwaffe found itself in such difficulties. First of all the front changed so rapidly and the Russians destroyed installations so systematically that it was difficult to provide adequate maintenan
