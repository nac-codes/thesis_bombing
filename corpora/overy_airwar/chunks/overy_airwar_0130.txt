In fact Germany was not to start producing at the same rate was reduced to 1,045 serviceable machines on the whole of the eastern front.127 By December this was reduced to 500 machines. The supply of the Demyansk pocket promised by Goering although there was often poor communication due to the enormous demands made on the signals regiments in getting radio and telephone links set up in sub-zero temperatures.192 Moreover the sheer number The job of supply and maintenance was given to Air Administrative Commands (Luftgaukommandos) that were run by low-ranking ex-First World War officers (Ergdénzungsoffiziere) brought back into active service in a reserve capacity. They had little technical training or aptitude for the tasks but much enthusiasm.2® The problem was exacerbated by the creation of Special Duty staffs recruited from among these ex-officers to act as mobile units to help ‘maintain and supply Luftwaffe units, equip the Luftwaffe ground organization, provide for initial repair of captured airfields...’. All air stations were required to provide one or two of its officers for such special duties and the temptation was to rid the station of unpopular and unwanted men whose technical competence for such a crucial task was often very low.2°! State Secretary Milch helped to ease the situation a little by insisting that groups of skilled engineers be recruited for the maintenance part of the task, but this meant denuding aircraft firms in the Reich of personnel and led to pressure from these firms for their return.2°2 Not until much later in the war did the repair and maintenance programme receive the same priority it enjoyed in Britain and Russia.
