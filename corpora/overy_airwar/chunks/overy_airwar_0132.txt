low.2° State Secretary Milch helped to ease the situation a little by insisting that groups of skilled engineers be recruited for the maintenance part of the task, but this meant denuding aircraft firms in the Reich of personnel and led to pressure from these firms for their return.2 Not until much later in the war did the repair and maintenance programme receive the same preparations to provide the air force alone of all the services with winter clothing.2 But proper preparations or appreciation of a situation of fighting in sub-zero temperatures had not been done, late 1941 because of the technical shortcomings in coping with cold. Cold-start methods proved entirely inadequate so that by January 1942 only 15 per cent of the Luftwaffe’s 100,000 vehicles at the front were in use while many aircraft were grounded for lack of the parts and equipment that such vehicles should have carried.2% The complicated cold-start equipment could not be operated in such low temperatures and more practical methods first pioneered by the Luftwaffe some years before were only first publicized in October 1941 and did not become War Office policy until November. The Quartermaster-General was still issuing explanatory leaflets as late as February 1942 while aircraft were being flown straight from the Mediterranean theatre to Russia without winter protective equipment.2% This was still happening the following winter, too, despite the experience of the first. At one of the key airfields supplying Stalingrad the only vehicle available for heating up engines was used instead to thaw out mechanics frozen fast to the machinery on which they were working.2° Under circumstances such as these serviceability was bound to fall off. By January 1943 the serviceability rate in the east was below 25 per cent.297 By contrast with production and supply, Luftwaffe military organization had been relatively successful. The absence of sufficient aircraft had been compensated for in part by the good tactical
