wn air division and an inadequate hierarchy of command between the front and Moscow, a satisfactory way had been found to move aircraft quickly to where they were wanted and to guarantee a high degree of co-operation with army groups once they were there.2째8 To facilitate such co-operation even more a system was finally developed in which each air-army commander placed a deputy commander and staff at the front to work closely with the army units whose headquarters would be either the same or be close enough to ensure constant direct contact.20 In addition to the reorganization of tactical air forces, Stavka created three strategic forces and a service maintenance command directly subordinate to the central command. The first was a strategic reserve consisting of special corps of one type of aircraft (fighter, ground-attack, etc.) which could be switched from one front or battle to another as need arose. This reserve in fact constituted some 43 per cent of all available tactical air forces by the end of the war. The second was a long-range bomber arm (ADD) set up in April 1942 for special strategic tasks on the battlefront and the third was a fighter defence force (PVO) modelled on the fighter defences set up in Britain before 1940.2! These arrangements avoided the difficulty of having an army air force primarily concerned with army support and so unable to see aircraft use in a wider strategic context.
