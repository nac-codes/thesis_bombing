e but airmen needed to learn them. Instead of dispersing effort, forces were conserved and concentrated before being used in the main offensive. Instead, too, of  headquarters would be either the same or be close enough to ensure constant direct contact.202 committing all units to a fixed position at the front, Stavka’s control of a large reserve gave flexibility in placing operational priority at certain points along the front. This did not necessarily guarantee permanent air supremacy but it would help to give local and temporary supremacy for a particular battle.213 These were lessons that could have been learned from the Luftwaffe in 1940, though the growing dispersion of German air forces compelled the Luftwaffe itself to abandon the degree of concentration that had been possible in the early Blitzkrieg and eventually to sacrifice flexibility as well. Other lessons were well-learned too. Steps were taken to ensure that Russian air bases were sufficiently camouflaged while the rear areas contained a system of staggered airfields consisting of hundreds of small temporary air strips near the front with larger operational bases some 40-60 kilometres behind the front, well dispersed to avoid enemy action.2!4 As the war drew on the Soviet Air Force elaborated its flexible concentration of air forces into a doctrine of the ‘air offensive’. The air offensive had two purposes. The first was to prepare the way for a ground attack by massive preparatory strikes against enemy airfields and supplies. The second was to give immediate support in large concentrations of aircraft to the ground armies, accompanied where necessary by attacks on tactical targets in the enemy rear. The tactics were designed specifically for aircraft. The fighters were given ‘their choice to attack targets in whatever manner they wished’, and were not confined to the direct battle area. In fact the fighter aircraft were encouraged to carry on the combat with the enemy air force over the enemy bases
