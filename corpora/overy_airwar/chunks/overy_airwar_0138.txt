ets in whatever manner they wished’, and were not confined to the direct battle area. In fact the fighter aircraft were encouraged to carry on the combat with the enemy air force over the enemy bases and before enemy aircraft reached Soviet lines. The balance between attacks on the enemy air force and defence of Soviet ground troops in the advance was to be decided through a highly centralized control of operations.2!5 Soviet sources after the war calculated that some 35 per cent of all sorties were flown for the purposes of achieving control over the battlefield, 46.5 per cent in support of ground troops. Of those sorties flown by the long-range bombers operating near the front, some 43 per cent were flown against enemy troop formations on the battlefield.216 This huge concentration of effort on the battlefront complemented the strategic aim of the Red Army, i.e. the destruction of enemy armed forces on the battlefield, a task that was helped considerably by the fact that the eastern combat zone was a shallow one, allowing maximum effect for the kind of air war that the Soviet supreme command chose to wage.  It took much longer for levels of training to be improved and for air force morale to be restored, although by the middle of the winter of 1941-42 morale on both sides was low. The Luftwaffe had suffered the additional problem of losing a very large number of the skilled and experienced pilots of 1939 and 1940 often through accident — Mélders, hero of the 1940 battles, was killed flying back  Page 62 of 309 21% authorizing the strategic use OF aircrait.
