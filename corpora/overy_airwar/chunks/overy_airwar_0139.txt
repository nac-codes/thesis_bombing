gh to ensure constant direct contact.20% hundreds of small temporary air strips near the front with larger operational bases some 40-60 kilometres behind the front, well dispersed to avoid enemy action.214 As the war drew on the Soviet Air was to be decided through a highly centralized control of operations.215 Soviet sources after the war calculated that some 35 per cent of all sorties were flown for the purposes of achieving control over to Ernst Udet’s funeral — and at such a rate that by the summer of 1942 flying instructors and test pilots were being drafted in to work at the front. Soviet aircraft losses had been high but because so many aircraft had been hit on the ground, their crews had survived. During the early months of the summer campaign of 1942, however, the Luftwaffe, though now considerably inferior in numbers, was able to continue to operate successfully due to better training and marginally better aircraft.212 This was not, of course, an advantage that was likely to last. Tactical and technical superiority was slowly eroded by improvements in Russian aircraft and tactics. Luftwaffe successes reflected, too, the fact that the German army offensive towards the Caucasus was regarded by Stalin and his staff as a diversion and that the main offensive of 1942 would be launched in the centre. Thus in accordance with Soviet strategy army and air force units were kept back in reserve and the minimum forces necessary kept in the south.218 Even though this mistake was realized in the end and the German advance finally halted, the delay in deploying all available units in the south played into Russian hands. The Luftwaffe continued to be heavily undersupplied and wore out what supplies there were in the southern attack. The assault on Sevastopol, for example, saw the loss of 300 German aircraft for the loss of 77 Soviet.212 Elsewhere, however, the Luftwaffe was facing heavy Soviet concentrations of aircraft in readiness for the expected renewed German attack
