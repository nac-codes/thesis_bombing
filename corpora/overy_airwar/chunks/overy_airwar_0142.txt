. The less successful MiG-3, Pe-8, Yak-4 and Su-2 went out of production in order to concentrate on the II-2, Il-4, Pe-2 and the improved LaGG and Yak fighters. The temporary improvement of the Luftwaffe’s position with the introduction of the Me 109G and FW 190 was finally eroded in the course of 1943. The task of the German air force in Russia would have been made considerably easier had it not been for the fact that the Western Allies, in lieu of a second front, promised to divert the Luftwaffe by air attacks in the west. Churchill tried to reassure Stalin from the start of the German invasion that bombing could have important strategic implications for the war in the east. On 28 June he wrote to Stalin that ‘a terrible winter of bombing lies before Germany. No one has yet had what they are going to get’. In September the same commitment was given; the best way to help Soviet forces was to tie down German air power in the west and to bomb the industrial sources of German war material.224 Stalin and the Soviet commanders retained a strong scepticism about the possibilities of doing anything decisive with bombing, particularly as the British placed greatest emphasis on the prospect of an internal German political collapse. Churchill was writing to Roosevelt at the same time that ‘we must subject Germany and Italy to a ceaseless and ever growing air bombardment. These measures may themselves produce an internal convulsion and collapse.’225 When America entered the war in 1941 strategic assistance from air activity in the west became a central part of Anglo-American strategy. The British resolved early in 1942 that in the absence of any ability to open a second land front in Europe air activity in the west would help ‘in taking the weight off Russia during the summer’.22° Churchill even promised to open a gas bombing campaign against the Reich if a single gas attack were carried out on the Soviet Union, backing up his promise with the secret information that ‘I have
