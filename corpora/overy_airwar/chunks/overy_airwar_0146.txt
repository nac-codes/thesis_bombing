total Luftwaffe combat strength in the west and east of only 3,551 serviceable aircraft. By January 1944 this had risen to 13,500 combat aircraft, by January 1945 to 15,500. The major drive on the Baltic front was supported by 7,000 Russian aircraft; that in the northern Ukraine by 2,800; and the final assault on Berlin and central Germany by a massive air army of 8,000 aircraft.231 Against these forces the Luftwaffe was able to offer only token resistance with dwindling resources. The reforms in organization and supply initiated by Milch in 1941 had come too late to affect the battles of 1943. What new production there was was needed for the defence of the Reich. Such defence had now become a major priority in order to keep the army fighting at all and out of sheer necessity the east was starved of the most modern equipment or the necessary replacements. Even the new tank destroyer aircraft, the Hs 129, equipped with the new armour-piercing cannon had to be sacrificed to efforts to keep the bombers at bay. Only 400 of them were produced in 1943 and 200 in 1944 even though its value had already been proved in the Kursk battles.232 In order not to disturb production programmes any further, older types like the Ju 87 ‘Stuka’ were kept in production. The medium-bomber programme which had been designed initially to give a powerful striking force on the eastern front against Russian troop concentrations had to be run down in favour of fighters. Because the strategic initiative in the air now lay with the attacker it made it difficult for the Luftwaffe to produce the kind of aircraft needed for Germany herself to carry out offensives, thus further disrupting chances of gaining a balanced aircraft production plan — a situation not unlike that facing Britain in the summer of 1940 when Beaverbrook’s rapid expansion of fighter output seriously delayed the programmes for other aircraft types.
