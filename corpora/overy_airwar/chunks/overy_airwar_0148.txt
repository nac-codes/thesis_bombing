e armament has just not been given the proper treatment and support’ and in the end capitulated to the pressures from the Speer ministry by placing aircraft production under its jurisdiction and abandoning everything in favour of the mass production of defence fighters to soften the impending blows from the combined bombing offensive in 1944.234 By this time some units on the eastern front were compelled to fight with biplanes. The campaign in the east was dominated throughout by the use of aircraft in combined operations. Major army offensives were usually preceded on both sides by a pre-emptive strike and by fierce air-to-air camhat Tn the Russian case the hasic nurnose of air activity at the frant was to he ‘a constant simnort for the infantrv in the farm of massed effective fire from the air during the  22% fierce air-to-air combat. In the Russian case the basic purpose of air activity at the front was to be ‘a constant support for the infantry in the form of massed effective fire from... the air during the entire course of the offensive’.225 The almost complete absence of long-range bomber operations was in sharp contrast to the war in the west and the Mediterranean. The Soviet Air Force devoted a mere 5 per cent of sorties to long-range operations and many that were carried out, such as the attacks on Berlin in 1941, were done so for propaganda purposes. Most Russian bombers were used for close support and attacks at the immediate rear of the battle zone. The initial designs for heavy bombers associated with the disgraced designer Tupolev, were dropped, and the Red Air Force lacked a satisfactory substitute until after the war. The long-range units were equipped with the Il-4 which had a very small bomb-load over long distances. A few four-engined Pe-8s were produced but production was restricted in favour of smaller aircraft because of the need to save resources.236 Had Stalin personally been committed to heavy bombing, the necessary machines might have been
