that there would not be any necessity for strategic air operations because of the speed of the campaign. It was hoped that Russian air bases, stocks and factories would fall into German hands before they could Page 67 of 309 23% be effectively destroyed from the air. Goering even created a special Beutekommando (booty command) for the purpose of seizing industrial resources and sending them back to Luftwaffe factories in the Reich.232 When it had finally become clear that Russian aircraft supply was well-organized and revitalized many miles behind the front and that the Red Air Force did not disintegrate with the first strikes against it, German strategy returned rather haltingly to the policies of the autumn of 1940. During the winter of 1941-42 the shortages of aircraft and the supply crisis at the front reduced the effectiveness of operations like the bombing of Moscow but in 1942 Hitler resurrected the ambitions of the early Luftwaffe for bombing the Urals and beyond. The Luftwaffe chief of staff had already proposed using heavy bombers for ‘far-ranging tasks of destruction’. Hitler demanded bombers that could attack ‘in horizontal flight, by night, against long distance targets which lie so far from our front that they could not be reached with other aircraft types’.240 The decision to begin long-range bombing again was frustrated by many factors. The long distances and inadequate bomb-loads, combined with the shortages of supply and the unhappy history of the Heinkel He 177 four-engined bomber undermined every attempt to fulfil the new ambition. Yet its urgency was clear. The enormous numerical superiority enjoyed by the Soviet air force  Page 68 of 309 23% —_— re ae ae ee ee Oe entoiniioant Reeeleeteiieiae eke Manion offensive in 1944.24 By this time some units on the eastern front were compelled to fight with biplanes. entire course of the offensive’.235 The almost complete absence of long-range bomber operations was in sharp contrast to the war in the west
