ed by General Marshall, that if Britain were defeated the aircraft would be needed anyway to defend the western hemisphere. Throughout 1941 the aid continued to expand.24° Roosevelt himself preferred his policy of remaining the ‘arsenal of democracy’. By late 1941 some 68 per cent of all aircraft production was sent to the active anti-Axis powers and of this figure some 75 per cent went to Britain, considerably strengthening Britain’s position in the Middle East and providing an important reservoir of reserves for the air battles of 1942 in addition to what the British economy was itself capable of producing. Despite the drawbacks  Page 69 of 309 24% defeated the aircraft would be needed anyway to defend the western hemisphere. Throughout 1941 the aid continued to expand.245 Roosevelt himself preferred his policy of remaining the ‘arsenal of the system of target planning in British aircraft production — a system in which unrealistic totals were proposed to act as a spur to industry — the aim of achieving total production of more than 2,000 a month was reached by the end of 1941 and sustained thereafter. The more optimistic ambition to achieve an output of 2,500 a month in 1941 — that is at about three times the current rate of German production — had to be shelved because of the great industrial effort involved in producing heavy bombers and had to be made up by imports from the United States.246 That the aircraft production effort should have exceeded that of the Axis powers so substantially reflected different strategic circumstances. In the course of 1941 and 1942 British survival depended both upon maintaining an adequate aerial home defence and an offensive air capability to undermine the German air effort at its sources within Germany. If this was sometimes at the expense of other services, it was only because the ability to defend Britain successfully had a necessary priority over the ability to attack.  Such a view was well understood in the United States. S
