expense of other services, it was only because the ability to defend Britain successfully had a necessary priority over the ability to attack.  Such a view was well understood in the United States. So much so that there developed growing pressure on the President to move from a policy of economic aid and moral encouragement toa policy of active war in defence of Britain. The Navy and Army were in general agreement that the time would soon come when it would be necessary to defend the western hemisphere, and that it would be more satisfactory from a military point of view if it could be defended using Britain as an advanced base, though there was disagreement over whether it should be a base for bombing or not.247 Since both Roosevelt and Secretary for War Stimson were enthusiastic about the use of aircraft in any future war, it became doubly important to ensure that bases from which the Axis powers could be attacked from the air, both in Britain and the Mediterranean, should not be lost permanently for the Americans.2“8 The first major discussions of strategy between Britain and America, the ABC 1 negotiations in March 1941, reached the conclusion that in the event of American entry into the war a sustained air offensive against Germany and Axis-controlled areas would be an essential part of overall strategy contributing to an eventual land offensive in Europe. The Joint Army-Navy Board approved the subsequent war plan, Rainbow 5, and it was on the strength of these recommendations that Roosevelt called on 9 July 1941 for an estimate of ‘overall production requirements required to defeat our potential enemies’.242  A plan was quickly submitted by the War Department summarizing the economic and military effort that America would need to make in a state of active war with Germany and Japan. To this plan was attached an annex hastily drawn up by the newly formed Air War Plans Division discussing the role of air strategy in the event of American participation in war. T
