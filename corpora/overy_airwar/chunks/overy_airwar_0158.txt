In August 1942 the plan was replaced by AWPD-42 which took account of the mounting tasks of the air forces and raised the total front-line requirements to 19,520 aircraft with a total aircraft production requirement in 1943 Page 70 of 309 24% ee en eee ee eo ee ee i em oe ee enn eee ee eee ee Tee ee ee ene ee ee ieee ee ee eee ane ee eee et ee ee eee tena ee eee eee ee ee ee a ee eee na ee nee ey Ne NN NAN BNE NAR DDN ANDO AE BNO EON AEN EE defeated the aircraft would be needed anyway to defend the western hemisphere.
