complement of 5,000 heavy and very heavy bombers and to be covered by a reserve of 109 per cent.252 of 146,000 aircraft.251 Even when this was later reduced to a total of 127,000 the figure still exceeded total German aircraft production for the whole war. Like the British planners in 1941-42, the American leaders placed great emphasis on the need to achieve and maintain ‘complete air ascendancy over the enemy’ as a prelude to carrying out combined tasks and together with the British there grew the expectation that the bombing offensive at the centre of the air plans might bring about defeat of Germany by destroying the vital economic centres. At the very least it was expected that the air forces would so undermine German economic and military expansion that even in the event of the Anglo-American forces being outnumbered by Axis troops due to the German defeat of Russia, an invasion would still be possible.252 The American air forces had achieved a position of some influence in strategic and war preparation only comparatively recently. There existed a persistent difficulty before 1941 in granting equal status to the air forces within the overall Army structure. Although such subordination need not of itself have been a disadvantage, it was felt to be so by those in command of air forces, and the resolution of the disagreement not only had considerable implications for the way in which air planning became integrated into overall war planning, but also improved morale. The fact that Roosevelt was attracted to air warfare helped to smooth the path toward granting greater autonomy to the Army Air Forces. In March 1939 the Air Corps was given control over the General Headquarters Air Force to give it some say in operational work but in November 1940 this control was once again removed and the GHQ Air Force was given a separate status under the commander of the Army Field Forces. The Air Corps was opposed to the division of command which gave too much responsibility to a
