between Britain and the United States. This was necessary not only to establish common strategic aims but also to integrate economic preparations and to devise a means for the mutually favourable conduct of operations. Both sides recognized from early in 1941 the wisdom of this course. At the ABC-1 staff conversations it had been decided that permanent military missions be established and this successful precedent was elaborated after the Washington conference between Roosevelt and Churchill into a system of permanent military and strategic collaboration through the Combined Chiefs of Staff. The establishment of this machinery had the effect of confirming Arnoldâ€™s position as an effective chief of staff despite his subordinate constitutional position. His close involvement in all staff discussions both on the Combined Staffs and on the American Joint Staffs was a direct result of the autonomy enjoyed by the RAF within the British structure. Although there were often substantial disagreements between the Allies during the course of the war, the combined staff system ensured that such disagreements could be discussed and resolved through collaboration.254  The attack on Pearl Harbor, while turning the United States involuntarily into a combatant power, did not substantially alter the strategic plans and priorities established in all the combined discussions throughout 1941. Such discussions had begun in early 1941 and had produced by March a document agreed by American and British staff which gave priority to defeating the European Axis powers first and containing Japanese aggression in the east. While preparations were made to mount a land invasion of Europe, it was also intended both to protect British naval and economic interests in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, and to develop an economic offensive against Germany mounted primarily from the air.255 The strategic outlines of the ABC-1 discussions remained remarkably secure over the following months of planning.
