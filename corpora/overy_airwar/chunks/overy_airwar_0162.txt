to develop an economic offensive against Germany mounted primarily from the air.255 The strategic outlines of the ABC-1 discussions remained remarkably secure over the following months of planning. For the British a massive invasion of the Continent was barely possible without American assistance; hence the importance of the policies  of peripheral containment and blockade.

Since both Allies were agreed on the need to attack Germany first, and the Americans with uneven enthusiasm were prepared to support the British initiatives in the Mediterranean, the outlines of the next years of war, already to a certain extent shaped by the size and nature of the ‘Victory’ production programme, could be firmly established. Up until the Washington conference in January 1942 British strategy had had to count on the possibility, however remote in operational terms, that strategic bombing might bring an end to the war without a land invasion, because of the weakness of British land forces.25* The entry of the United States with its vast army contributed to a reassessment of the future shape and requirements of an air war. Air strategy assumed a particular importance for the Americans first of all because the air offensive was one of the few ways in which America could participate fully and quickly in the war against Germany. The Arnold-Slessor agreement later in 1942, which directed that only Americans should fly American aircraft, ensure
