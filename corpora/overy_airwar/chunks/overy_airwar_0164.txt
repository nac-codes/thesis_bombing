al and the growing problem in the Atlantic forced the diversion of resources to a wide range of theatres and purposes. Since the security of the Atlantic sea lanes and the eastern Mediterranean were essential prerequisites for the final assault on Europe itself the strategy for 1942 had gradually to move away from the concentration of air and ground forces for the final defeat of Germany to the strategy preferred by Churchill of blockade and encirclement. This move was undertaken at a time when it was still feared that Hitler would be victorious in Russia and could hence turn south in late 1942 anda separate, American, fear based largely on poor intelligence, that the German air force was much larger than it actually was.258 The move demonstrated, too, that Allied strategy, particularly air strategy, was in some disarray. The failure in the Atlantic was to a large extent due to the failure to get air forces committed early enough and in large enough numbers to have a decisive influence. The collapse in the Mediterranean theatre, though not due to a shortage of aircraft, had demonstrated that air superiority there was not being exploited as successfully as it might be. Moreover there were additional problems caused through the lack of American combat experience and the lack of experience in inter-service and inter-allied co-operation.  For all these reasons the combined bomber offensive had to be postponed and was only slowly built up after the agreed Joint Directive in August 1942, while the build-up of AAF in Britain was delayed long enough to make it unlikely that an assault on Europe could have been attempted before 1944 even had the shipping space been available.?5* Since the combined offensive was seen as the  aeee nt aT orenen af wcemeTnman fan on tile (i eenenan Rifas Tmo n Tee fnn Semen ni men manen Dal mare fan Shin morn wceks met Me esermetnes coe nnn mens can dn lee em Seren ob Fon wes emnemenn miner Fon bln on wine Leaheeens ee eens seen Milenten. seems
