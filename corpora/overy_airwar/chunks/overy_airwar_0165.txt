The beginning of the night-bombing campaign and the start of the so-called ‘circuses’ in March 1942 were both designed to reduce Luftwaffe effectiveness by attacking the aircraft industry on the one hand and enticing German fighter forces into unequal combat on the other.2©° But both these aims, already clearly expressed at the Arcadia conference, had to be defended against demands for air forces by the navies, and the demand for a prepared tactical force by both armies. The old arguments for combined operations in favour of ‘independent’ operations reasserted themselves as the insistent demands for action in the Atlantic battle and the Middle East made themselves felt in Allied strategy. During these two campaigns the British seized the opportunity to develop practical ways of achieving air supremacy through the exercise of air power in a multiplicity of roles. These developments
