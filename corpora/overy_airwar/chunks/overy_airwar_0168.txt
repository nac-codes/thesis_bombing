Nevertheless Hitler felt confident enough of victory in Russia to send Fliegerkorps II southwards to help his embattled Axis ally on the grounds that it was ‘no longer required in the East’.263 The effect of dispatching more aircraft southwards was to weaken the Russian front without providing enough to have a decisive impact in the Mediterranean. Moreover those aircraft that did move southwards were faced with a mounting number of objectives as Hitler’s Mediterranean strategy became more uncertain and the strategic tasks multiplied.

For a long time the area was considered to be in the Italian sphere of influence and the Italian commanders tended to treat the German forces as guests.26 Hitler had victory in Russia to send Fliegerkorps II southwards to help his embattled Axis ally on the grounds that it was ‘no longer required in the East’.2®3 mastery over the supply corridor to North Africa and to ‘paralyse enemy traffic through the Mediterranean’ and in the end was also to be asked to support the final offensive into Egypt.2®4 The result was the same as on the Russian front; a growing dispersal of air effort and a rapid attrition of available air forces. Neither Raeder nor Kesselring, who both understood why the Allies paid so much attention to the Mediterranean, were able to persuade Hitler to concentrate on one or two crucial tasks there. He preferred to let the Luftwaffe cope with a wide range of tasks for which it patently did not have the resources. Fliegerkorps II arrived in Sicily with o
