Certainly in the field of co-operation and in the development of ideas concerning air superiority the gap between the two sides widened, although Axis problems stemmed as much from poor supply and strategic confusion as from tactical incompetence.  British air superiority in the desert war was based on a balance between the use of bomber and fighter forces and an emphasis on mobility and communications. Fighter aircraft were used for offensive sweeps against enemy fighters and forward airfields.
