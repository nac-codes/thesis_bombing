were able to fly into Malta some 700 fighter aircraft over the first half of 1942, more fighters than had been available at the beginning of the Battle of Britain.2® In the end Hitler was not prepared to divert sufficient resources from what he saw as the main battle. Concluding that ‘Egypt belongs more properly to the Italian sphere of influence’ he was prepared to leave the bulk of the southern front to Italian efforts and in the end to abandon North Africa altogether.2®6 For the Italians this had much more serious implications. Unable as they had been to contain British offensives without some German assistance they not surprisingly proved unable various air forces were directed from a central air headquarters which, while working closely with the army on the ground, was not subordinate to its demands.2® This flexibility required first of all Page 76 of 309 26% radio and radar equipment that moved with the air units helping to direct the aircraft to where they were most needed.2° Finally a permanent armed reconnaissance was established to produce as British mobile radar and communications units were one of the keys to the success of the RAF in North Africa. Imperial War Museum  Above all the RAF emphasized an important tactical principle; that air warfare was a continuous pursuit. Given that air superiority could never be absolute as long as the enemy was capable of flying aircraft operationally, air activity would have to be continuous in order to maintain superiority. RAF command of the air in the desert was never lost over the whole of the first half of 1942 despite reverses on the ground and when the final battles came in November only 148 Axis aircraft were destroyed in the first twenty days of fighting because Axis air power had been eroded through continuous attrition throughout the summer.2®° The complementary use of bombers and fighters and good intelligence was put to good purpose in the final invasion of Europe later in the war, although the difficult
