In fact early problems in the implementation of the new air tactics stemmed directly from the failure to work out a satisfactory relationship between the services. Churchill himself had called for ‘drastic reform’ in the summer of 1941 and accused the Air Ministry of being ‘most hard and unhelpful both to the army and to the navy...’27° The problem was the same as the one faced earlier by Germany and Russia as to the nature of the relationship between the ground and air forces. The RAF suspected that the army would prefer to run the tactical air force from the ground, a fact which Brooke’s demand for an integral air component did nothing to dispel. A satisfactory compromise was arrived at by creating a centralized air command with direct access to the theatre commander working side by side with the army as co-equals in combat. The various air headquarters were set up beside the army headquarters and a permanent liaison staff established. The ground forces could request assistance but could not require it and the close relationship of the two headquarters meant that the centrally directed air forces could sift through the various demands for help without the interference of superior army officers.271 What was so surprising was that the system took so long to evolve,
