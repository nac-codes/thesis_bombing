centrally directed air forces could sift through the various demands for help without the interference of superior army officers.271 What was so surprising was that the system took so long to evolve, and having been developed failed to be imitated not only by the AAF but even by the RAF in other battles. When Coningham arrived to take over air command in the western desert he discovered that the lessons learnt so shortly before in Egypt had been forgotten and set about re-establishing close co-operation together with central direction of fighters and radar. Similarly the lessons on supply and maintenance from 1940-41 and on communications and mobility had to be relearned. Large numerical advantage was being frittered away by poor repair facilities and poor control of operations. The establishment of the Northwest African Air Service Command solved the first problem and the second was repaired by the extension of Tedder’s tactical doctrines from the eastern desert.272  With the AAF there were two rather separate problems. The first was how to get the air forces of the two powers to work side by side. This was much more difficult in a combined offensive operation than in, for example, the bombing offensive where the British and American air forces agreed satisfactorily to differ, one to bomb at night and the other by day. The second problem was the fact that the AAF had its own political battles to fight with the other American services and could not simply adopt British tactical experience as its own. Very early on in the Torch campaign it became obvious that some kind of inter-allied central air command was necessary. AAF units were flying operations only within the narrow confines of their own army divisional sectors and in response to the  Page 77 of 309 27% of being ‘most hard and unhelpful both to the army and to the navy...’22° The problem was the same as the one faced earlier by Germany and Russia as to the nature of the relationship between the immediate requ
