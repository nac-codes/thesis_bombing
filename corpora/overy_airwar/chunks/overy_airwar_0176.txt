‘most hard and unhelpful both to the army and to the navy...’22° The problem was the same as the one faced earlier by Germany and Russia as to the nature of the relationship between the immediate requirements of the ground forces. The appointment of Tedder as chief of the Mediterranean Air Command and of Coningham as chief of the Northwest Africa Air Forces restored central command and subordinated both AAF and RAF units to one commander.223 The problem of inter-service relationships on the American side was more complicated. By April 1942 the AAF had finally won the battle with the ground forces over a command doctrine in which the air commanders had some independent control over air forces instead of the structure favoured by the army of attaching small air units to each divisional and sub-divisional unit completely subordinate to the ground. Yet in practice the regulations in Field Manual 31-35 (Aviation in Support of Ground Forces) still kept the air forces tied to the needs of the army by insisting that ‘the most important target at a particular time will usually be that target which constitutes the most serious threat to operations of the supported ground force. The final decision as to priority of targets rests with the commander of the supported unit’.2”4 The lack of clarity in this relationship was encouraged by the fact that there was only one air liaison officer with each large ground unit with his own system of communication to airfields, and virtually no communication between air and ground. The adoption of the RAF form of organization worked only slowly. It was barely considered for the directive on air warfare published for Torch in October 1942. The rewriting of the Field Manual which the obvious failure in Tunisia had shown to be necessary only occurred in July 1943, and then only after the army had been able to win control over its own force of communications and artillery-spotting aircraft. Nevertheless the July changes incorporated in Field Manua
