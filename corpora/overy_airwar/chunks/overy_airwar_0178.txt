In some cases Axis forces did co-operate successfully but the German forces continually expressed what Kesselring described as ‘exasperation at our ally’s inefficiency’, refusing to accept Italian orders despite Hitler’s own directive to the effect that the German Commander-in-Chief was directly subordinate to Mussolini and would receive instructions from the Comando Supremo.2?6 The mutual distrust that evolved helped to explain the additional failure to establish a satisfactory basis for the winning of air supremacy. This failure was caused partly by the difficulties imposed by a shortage of proper air bases and trained servicing personnel as on the eastern front; and partly by the continued inability of the Axis leadership to see that air supremacy could only be won by the co-ordinated work of fighter and bomber aircraft, the use of good communications and radar and the careful planning of priorities and resources in such a way as to minimize losses and maximize military effectiveness. Thus it proved possible for the Axis powers to achieve temporary air mastery over Malta and the supply route to North Africa by concentrating every effort on one specific target, but only at the cost of weakening Axis air forces everywhere else, while eliminating Malta as an air base for only a handful of weeks.2”” Hitler encouraged these difficulties by his own failure to execute the invasion of Malta and later his insistence that valuable transport aircraft be frittered away on the relief of Tunis, by which time the Luftwaffe in the south was so short of aircraft, parts and trained crews that transport SS ee ee Oe directive to the effect that the German Commander-in-Chief was directly subordinate to Mussolini and would receive instructions from the Comando Supremo.2”6 The mutual distrust that evolved weakening Axis air forces everywhere else
