Yet even had the military position of the Axis air forces been improved by better use it is still doubtful whether they could have achieved much more, given that the Allies were committed to the strategic aim of achieving air supremacy by massive production programmes against an  more meagre. Moreover its quality had been so low that attrition was very high. When Italy surrendered there were only 447 operational aircraft available while 5,272 had been lost in combat or through accident.272 What is so surprising is that it took so long during 1942 for Allied superiority to make itself felt. Once such a situation had been reached, however, it was only a question of  time before the Luftwaffe in the south was eliminated as a threat and only a question of time before the Allied air offensive in the Mediterranean, particularly against shipping, brought about more significant gains for the Allies.
