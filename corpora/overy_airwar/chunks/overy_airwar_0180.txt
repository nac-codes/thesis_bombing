the enemy air force but to significantly aid the defeat of enemy ground forces by taking independent strategic action.  If the Allies took time to establish air superiority in the Mediterranean theatre, even heavier weather was made of the Battle of the Atlantic. The ocean war was the second branch of the strategy finally decided upon for 1942, and was of crucial importance in the decision for the final invasion of Europe. The failure to secure Allied lines of communication not only threatened military efforts to relieve Russia but put Britain under the permanent threat of siege and the loss of crucial imports. By 1942 the Allies enjoyed certain advantages. The German effort in the Atlantic was now confined to U-boats. Any air effort in the area had been nullified by the increasing activity of the RAF in 1941 and the lack of strategic priority given to German air-naval operations. The same was largely true of surface vessels. The only attempt to get a large battleship out into the Atlantic ended with the confirmation, if such were needed, that ships like the Bismarck were always going to be vulnerable to eae ee ee ee ee ee re ee ee, oe ee eee Yes See eS ee a ee a oo ee ae oe ae ae ae a ee a a ae a ee a weakening Axis air forces everywhere else, while eliminating Malta as an air base for only a handful of weeks.272 Hitler encouraged these difficulties by his own failure to execute the invasion of Malta air attack.28! Nevertheless the shipping losses of 1942 and the first half of 1943 were so severe that the Atlantic Battle assumed a significance much greater than the Allies had initially expected, or for that matter Hitler himself. For the Allies the Battle showed once again the difficulties in co-operation and command experienced in the Mediterranean. This time the problem was to some extent reversed; instead of ground forces grudgingly conceding the independence of the air, air forces only grudgingly conceded the importance of diverting effort to the naval war and
