lem was to some extent reversed; instead of ground forces grudgingly conceding the independence of the air, air forces only grudgingly conceded the importance of diverting effort to the naval war and accepting the temporary subordination to naval command. In the United States Admiral King was forced in 1942 to call on the AAF to supply bombers, particularly the long-range Liberators, for anti-submarine work. The Army replied by forming the AAF Anti-Submarine Command but resisted naval demands to control ‘tactics and allocations of force down to operational level’.282 Only Marshall’s personal insistence gave the navy control over 187 heavy bombers for the anti-submarine war in June 1942 and in return for a commitment that the AAF would have undivided control over the build-up of bomber forces for the combined offensive.283 In Britain the crisis took an almost identical form. Bomber Command insisted that the threat from U-boats could only be met by attacking the sources of production rather than the end- product at sea. Harris deplored ‘the purely defensive use of airpower’ and tried to force a policy of concentrating on the bombing of Germany as a first priority.2®4 Such resistance was in the face of naval demands for aircraft for a wide number of roles. In March 1942 Admiral Pound had drafted ‘The Needs of the Navy’ in which he insisted that the solution to the Atlantic Battle lay in ‘largely increasing the strength of our land-based air forces working over the sea’, including operational control over these aircraft and the right to train their crews.285 The situation was not resolved until  Page 79 of 309 28% oome or these experiences were shared Dy the AXIS poWers as Well. Lhe aifficuities in exercising joint commands in the southern theatre were made worse by the political interests of the two allied the AAF Anti-Submarine Command but resisted naval demands to control ‘tactics and allocations of force down to operational level’.282 Only Marshall's personal insist
