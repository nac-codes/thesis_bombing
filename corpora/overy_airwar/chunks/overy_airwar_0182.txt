itical interests of the two allied the AAF Anti-Submarine Command but resisted naval demands to control ‘tactics and allocations of force down to operational level’.282 Only Marshall's personal insistence gave the navy control product at sea. Harris deplored ‘the purely defensive use of airpower’ and tried to force a policy of concentrating on the bombing of Germany as a first priority.284 Such resistance was in the face of increasing the strength of our land-based air forces working over the sea’, including operational control over these aircraft and the right to train their crews.28> The situation was not resolved until Churchill's establishment of the Anti-U-boat Warfare Committee in August 1942 which, while defending the need to continue the night bombing offensive, insisted that resources be diverted to the anti-submarine war, mainly in the form of long-range aircraft for Coastal Command which already came under the operational control of the Admiralty for Atlantic operations. From the winter of 1942-43 onwards the problem of rivalry between the services was overcome at the highest political level.28°  Such rivalry proved to be only part of the problem. The basic difficulties were more technical. More aircraft and better co-operation went some way towards containing the threat from submarines but victory would only be possible by improving the means of detection. To achieve this the Allies developed a large carrier force working together with long-range bombers to protect the convoys and to hunt for U-boats over a wider area, and advanced radar to accurately detect their presence.  By the beginning of 1942 the Royal Navy had only four modern carriers, the United States the same. Although large numbers of carriers were laid down in 1942 itself, this decision came far too late  ta nentant tha mansivn attvitian af Allind shinning in 1049 and 1042 Vat tha aridanan chaumd annoaliacivale that anntuace annamnanind her asan wh naeviave timnen nancidavahle onfar than th
