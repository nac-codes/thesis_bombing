Bomber Command insisted that the threat from U-boats could only be met by attacking the sources of production rather than the end- product at sea. Harris deplored ‘the purely defensive use of airpower’ and tried to force a policy of concentrating on the bombing of Germany as a first priority.2®4 Such resistance was in the face of increasing the strength of our land-based air forces working over the sea’, including operational control over these aircraft and the right to train their crews.285 The situation was not resolved until to prevent the massive attrition of Allied shipping in 1942 and 1943. Yet the evidence showed conclusively that convoys accompanied by escort carriers were considerably safer than those without. Moreover escort carriers proved to be difficult targets for submarines. Only one American escort carrier was sunk in the Atlantic throughout the war, while carrier-borne aircraft sank 33 submarines between April 1943 and September 1944 in addition to providing guidance for surface vessels and long-range aircraft in making attacks on submarine targets.287 Before carriers could become fully effective the other necessary technical breakthroughs had been made. The first was the development of suitable very long-range aircraft to patrol the ‘Greenland Gap’, that section of the Atlantic beyond the range of ordinary sea-going aircraft. These converted bomber aircraft became available in quantity only in 1943; by July the RAF had 37 such aircraft, the US navy 209.288 The most important change was the introduction of 10-centimetre radar which could not be detected by submarines and gave Allied air forces a breathing space during which it became possible for submarines to be attacked on
