ange was the introduction of 10-centimetre radar which could not be detected by submarines and gave Allied air forces a breathing space during which it became possible for submarines to be attacked on the surface without prior detection of the aircraft. This technical innovation coincided with a change in tactics introduced by Dénitz which increased the effectiveness of Allied aircraft even more. Where previously submarines had dived at the first indication of hostile aircraft, the difficulty in detecting radar and the successful destruction of an aircraft by submarine anti-aircraft fire persuaded the Germans to adopt a policy of fighting aircraft on the surface with improved anti-aircraft defences and by sailing in large groups to provide mutual defence.28° But far from giving immunity such tactics made it even easier for approaching aircraft, using the new radar, to detect the submarines and to destroy them. These changing circumstances rekindled the German navy’s concern to co-operate more fully with the Luftwaffe. Only through air power could the threat to the German naval war be overcome. But lacking any aircraft carriers or a suitable long-range bomber, Dénitz’s entreaties fell on deaf ears. Hitler refused to sanction a carrier programme because it would divert resources from army production. What heavy bombers there were were diverted during 1942 to the eastern front and to the renewed bombing operations against Britain, leaving only a skeleton force on the Atlantic coast for long-range reconnaissance.22° Finally when Dénitz remonstrated with Hitler in September 1942 about ‘the need for aircraft to support the U-boats to a much greater extent than has been the case up to the present time’ he once again ran up against the hostility of Goering.291 Neither Goering nor Hitler were persuaded that the navy’s demand was as serious or as urgent as its leaders made out. Both were able to point to the growing success of the U-boat campaign even at a time of tactical cr
