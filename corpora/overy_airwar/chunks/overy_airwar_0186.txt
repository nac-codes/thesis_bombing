. Unable to find an effective jamming device against centimetric radar the submarines became particularly vulnerable in the narrow approaches to their Biscay bases. Here Coastal Command, with 150 long-range aircraft, was able to contain the submarine threat during the course of 1943, more than justifying the diversion of resources and scientific effort to the waging of air war at sea.293 Although there were complaints that too much effort had been diverted the Allies had been compelled to work on the assumption that Germany would increase its strategic commitment in the Atlantic, particularly by diverting air forces in large numbers to the naval war. The fact that such diversion did not occur did not make Allied preparations unreasonable, but served instead to demonstrate the gap that was growing between German and Allied appreciation of what air power was capable of doing. In both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean the Allies made use of the German priorities in the east to establish overwhelming air superiority and to use such superiority to the benefit of the surface forces in both a direct and indirect way. For Germany the strategic circumstances of 1942 and 1943 made it difficult to devote sufficient emphasis to either battle, and in particular to the diversion of the Luftwaffe to tasks other than army support on the Russian front. Even despite these circumstances, however, there was little evidence that Hitler or Goering thought such a diversion worth the effort. The Allied victory was thus a product not simply of different circumstances but of different views on the use of air power and its relationship to the strategies of the other services.
