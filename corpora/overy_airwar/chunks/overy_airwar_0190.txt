s of Luftwaffe production and by weakening the economic potential and war-willingness of the Third Reich. In the ‘Directive for the Bomber Offensive’ produced at Casablanca the air forces were instructed to ‘take every opportunity to attack Germany by day, to destroy objectives that are unsuitable for night attack, to sustain continuous pressure on the German reducing its economic ability to wage war.2%4 Harris reiterated this principle when resisting the diversion of bombing effort to submarine targets when he stated that ‘the decided policy of the war is to bomb the enemy soft until a comparatively small land force... can overcome his remaining resistance’.2°* Because of the central place of air power in the strategy for eventual victory there was were established in favour of a primary European commitment in 1943.226 objectives’.227 It was essential to disperse the effort of the Luftwaffe and to keep up a constant war of attrition, particularly by regular fighter intrusion by day, in order to wear down enemy resistance morale, to impose heavy losses on the German day fighter force and to contain German fighter strength away from the Russian and Mediterranean theatres of war’.228 There was little indication that a decision in Europe was expected through air power alone and the American leaders in particular regarded the bombing offensive as simply a prelude to the final invasion. There was, however, widespread debate on how such a combined bombing offensive should be carried out. Not only was there a question of target selection, but also the problem of command; and both these issues revolved around the question of whether the bombing served the invasion directly, or did so in an indirect way by reducing German economic performance and morale. The RAF had adopted night bombing because of the early success of German day defences and this of itself encouraged the belief that the indirect approach was the most successful.
