re a high priority from Roosevelt for aircraft production in late 1942. By the middle of 1943 manpower problems had become increasingly acute, particularly for British production, and although the necessary air forces were provided they came later than originally intended and not in full force until March 1944. During 1943 bomber aircraft were diverted to the Mediterranean — though Portal believed this would be an advantage by varying the direction of attacks — and to the battle against the submarines.2™ In addition to this diversion of effort the German fighters were able to inflict sufficiently high loss rates to bring a temporary halt to the CBO in the autumn of 1943. It could not be undertaken again until long-range fighter escorts were provided. This delay proved to be only temporary, however. Experiments with long-range fighters using additional fuel tanks had been carried out through 1943 in anticipation of just  wee en ed ed eit it tdi peel ae et De en he Sem te REN tt ek en BM De en ee cree, mee og Fe Vet, pee ee oN ee th Le eee en tn dd ee  Page 84 of 309 29% Moe VEL ALL PUWEL.
