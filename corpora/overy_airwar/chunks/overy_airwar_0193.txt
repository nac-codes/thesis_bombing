Because of the central place of air power in the strategy for eventual victory there was were established in favour of a primary European commitment in 1943.29° an essential contribution to the reduction of fighter strength which threatened by mid-1943 to prevent any bombing at all.299 On the need to attack the enemy fighter production there was general rather generously so. Any final decision on how direct the help for invasion should be was postponed and efforts concentrated on the build-up of bomber forces and tactical development.3 were diverted to the Mediterranean — though Portal believed this would be an advantage by varying the direction of attacks — and to the battle against the submarines.3° In addition to this diversion such a need, and neared completion at the crucial period before the invasion of the Continent. Once the long-range fighters were available in large enough numbers the bombing offensive could once again be vigorously pursued. The delay, however, had finally brought to an end the strategy of using the bomber offensive as an indirect weapon for easing invasion. Instead the bombers were diverted to tasks directly related to the invasion itself. Throughout 1943 preparations were made for launching ‘Overlord’ and at the Quadrant Conference in Quebec the CCS Final Report gave the Pointblank operation against the Luftwaffe and the air industry the highest priority as a ‘pre-requisite to “Overlord”’.2©2 From that point on the arguments hardened once again around how command over the bomber forces should be exercised and what targets would be most profitably attacked as a prelude to invasion. Despite the efforts of both Arnold and Harris to retain the original conception of the bombing offensive, the Chiefs of Staff decided that bombing should concentrate on defeating the Luftwaffe and disrupting enemy communications by a long-term transportation plan. In the final directive for ‘Overlord’ the strategic air forces were given the task ‘to deplete the
