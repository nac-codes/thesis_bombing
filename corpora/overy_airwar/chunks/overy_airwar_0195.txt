Supreme Allied Commander who also had the responsibility for co-ordinating the efforts of the bomber forces with those of the invasion air forces. In effect direction was given to Eisenhower’s deputy, Tedder, who had already had experience in strategic air command in the Mediterranean and who was consequently trusted by both Portal and Arnold.3% The fierce inter-service arguments demonstrated yet again that co-operation as well as sound strategy were essential components in the use of air power.  The Overlord plan finally resolved the ambiguities and indecisiveness of bombing strategy. Given limited targets with high strategic priority instead of the earlier and more general instruction to undertake ‘the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial and economic systems’ the bomber forces were highly successful. The attack code-named ‘Big Week’ in February 1944 finally undermined an already demoralized and weakened Luftwaffe, and the long-term interdiction policy caused the expected disruption of German lines of communication to great effect.305 The invasion itself was achieved at a time when air mastery had clearly passed to the Allies. In fact had intelligence on the Luftwaffe been better it would have been obvious that the battles of 1942 had already so eroded the German air force that it was never able to regain the initiative. The tactical use of air forces conformed to the operational experience of the earlier campaigns and together with the use of bombers on strategic tasks ensured a permanent air supremacy.  The Allies also continued to enjoy a large numerical advantage. For the final invasion the Allied air forces were allowed a generous margin of reserves, a necessity predicted by the air planners on past experience. In addition the logistical preparations were so thorough and well executed that a high level of maintenance was established as well as remarkable mobility in the final advances towards the German frontiers.
