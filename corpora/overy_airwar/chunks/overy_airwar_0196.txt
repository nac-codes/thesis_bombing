The IX Engineer Command was responsible for the building and rehabilitation of some 241 airfields during the operations and considerable economic and organizational effort went into the provision of satisfactory rear services.3°° Local shortages of suitable bomb types and of aviation fuel developed, but neither shortage was ever critical.
