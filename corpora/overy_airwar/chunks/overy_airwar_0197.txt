Repair and March 1945.39” Such figures confirmed the fact that the Luftwaffe was no longer a serious threat. The long programme of attrition coupled with the bombing of aircraft production had reduced significant opposition. What opposition there was was considerably exaggerated. The Allied invasion of Europe was in no way comparable to the German planned invasion of England in 1940. Not only did the German air force have the problem of stemming the Russian advance against Soviet forces with a vast numerical air superiority, it was forced to face the powerful Allied threat in the west with barely more defence aircraft than the RAF had had in 1940. Despite the constant warnings that German air power was reviving in the summer and autumn of 1943, there was never any question, given the failure in German aircraft supply, but that air supremacy would be won by the Western Allies in a comparatively short period of time. Both in terms of production and in terms of combat aircraft available at the front the disparity was unbridgeable, as the following table shows: Table 5: Production, Strength* and Losses of Britain, United States and Germany 1942-44308 (i) Production and Strength (P, S) 1942  P Ss P S F S 47,836 (a)6,610 85,898 (a)20,185 96,318 (a)32,957 (b)12,800 (b)32,075 (b)46,244  Page 85 of 309 30% the invasion itself. 1/hrougnhout 1945 preparations were made for launching Overlord and at the Quadrant Conference in Quebec the CCo Final Keport gave the Pointbiank operation against the Luftwaffe and the air industry the highest priority as a ‘pre-requisite to “Overlord”’.3©2 From that point on the arguments hardened once again around how command over the bomber forces should be and disrupt the enemy’s rail communications, particularly those affecting the enemy’s movement towards the Overlord lodgement area...’203 Moreover
