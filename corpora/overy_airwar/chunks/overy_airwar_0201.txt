resources to be diverted to defence at home, and instead increased efforts to produce a German bomber force to rival that of the Allies. Not only on the Russian front but in the attack against England Hitler insisted that a large-scale bombing capability should be retained. The irony was that the Luftwaffe had been unable to sustain such a capability with any serious military effect during the winter of 1940-41 when there was little opposition, and when the air forces contained a satisfactory balance between fighter and bomber forces. By 1943 when the Allies began to bomb Germany in strength not only was British defence very much better, but the balance within the Luftwaffe had moved in favour of fighters on the insistence of the Luftwaffe and air ministry staff.311  Page 88 of 309 31% Luftwaffe massed a mere 900 aircraft for the final effort and these, too, were destroyed in a matter of days.3°° This was not simply a result of deficiencies of supply on the German side but was a fact of terms of technology, too, the Allied powers had a measurable lead in most, though not all, areas of advanced research. The lack of a German bombing offensive and the failures in Russia finally persuaded Hitler to take over more of the direction of the Luftwaffe himself. This fact only helped to exaggerate the many problems already faced by the air force. Hitler had his own views on air warfare, a very limited knowledge of how to use aircraft and very little understanding of air force logistics. He insisted that for defence purposes anti-aircraft guns would be sufficient, and therefore refused to sanction the diversion of resources to a defence in depth like that practised by the RAF in 1940. Secondly, he failed to understand how the system of air reserves operated, and insisted that reserves should be used for concentrated operations with the largest numbers that could be mobilized at any one time, thus risking the denuding of large parts of the Luftwaffe’s future strength.3!2 In his
