rves should be used for concentrated operations with the largest numbers that could be mobilized at any one time, thus risking the denuding of large parts of the Luftwaffe’s future strength.3!2 In his directive for opposing the D-Day landings on 16 June 1944 he required that ‘half of all fighter units in Germany must be kept in readiness to support the army with low-level attacks; and in an emergency all units’.313 This not only betrayed his view of the air force as primarily for close support of ground units but also his inability to grasp that air superiority could not be won with sudden attacks and heroic gestures, but only with a strategy of patient, routine and mundane operations, keeping a balance where possible between present emergency and a capability for the future. Later in the war Hitler accused the Luftwaffe of hoarding resources, mistaking the policy of reserve-building and long-term logistical planning for cowardice. As a result he continually resented the diversion of economic resources to aircraft production and preferred to place the main economic weight on the army as a potential war-winning service. To some extent his view was vindicated by the fact that air supremacy did not have quite the value that its fiercest proponents had hoped, but it did mean that Germany had virtually no way of preventing heavy bombing and thus protecting army as well as air force industry, and also less and less satisfactory intelligence about Allied forces, both of which facts reduced the effectiveness of ground forces in the slow retreat.314  Although the German military and political leadership opposed the idea of large-scale air defence German air commanders built up a defence force regardless, in the hope that neither Hitler nor Goering would object when faced with a fait accompli. On the basis of an initial air defence shield, the so-called Kammhuber Line, a series of defence areas were set up over the Reich with a complement of day and night fighters whose movem
