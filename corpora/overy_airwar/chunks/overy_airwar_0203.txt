fait accompli. On the basis of an initial air defence shield, the so-called Kammhuber Line, a series of defence areas were set up over the Reich with a complement of day and night fighters whose movements were co-ordinated by central combat stations set up at five main points opposing the Allied lines of intrusion. But there were many difficulties to overcome. The development of German air intelligence had been much slower than elsewhere. Much of the observation had been carried out by eye only, without the aid of radar, and a cumbersome system of communications had been set up whose effectiveness declined rapidly under the increased air activity of 1942. A unified, radar-based system did not emerge until the end of 1943. In fact the development of a satisfactory command and tactical relationship between night and day fighters was only developed by the autumn of 1942, long after the threat from British bombing had been  er Ne pens ee a presented.315 Inter-service rivalry also produced difficulties. The army and navy, for example, ran separate air intelligence services of their own in the front-line areas. In overall weapons output the low production priority accorded the night fighters meant that the 3rd Luftwaffe fleet in France had no night fighters at all at one time, despite its crucial geographical position and the valuable French industrial targets offered to Allied bombers.216 Under such circumstances it was perhaps surprising that the Luftwaffe achieved such success against bombers in 1943 that both the RAF and AAF suspended attacks for some months. The suspension was related to the preparations for ‘Overlord’ which were already in progress by late 1943, but it was also clear that even a modest air defence, such as the Luftwaffe was forced to fight with in 1943, was capable of success against a well-armed air enemy provided that a sufficiently high loss-rate could be inflicted. Given such success it was even more remarkable that Hitler failed to divert more
