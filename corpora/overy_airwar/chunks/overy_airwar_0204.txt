was capable of success against a well-armed air enemy provided that a sufficiently high loss-rate could be inflicted. Given such success it was even more remarkable that Hitler failed to divert more effort to expanding air defences during the period when the CBO was in abeyance in late 1943. But instead resources continued to be sucked into army support in Russia and Italy leaving the Luftwaffe frustrated in its efforts to construct a more general air strategy around the defence of the Reich. When the Allies introduced the long-range day and night fighters, a move which the Luftwaffe had already anticipated, the balance swung back firmly in favour of the Allied air forces since so little had been done in the interval in the way of strengthening German defences.317 Combined with a policy of large-scale production and a lead in radar technology air superiority passed to the Allies even over Germany itself. While Galland and Milch insisted on the need for a three- or fourfold numerical advantage of defending over attacking aircraft, the Luftwaffe command was forced to accept Goeringâ€™s verdict that the long-range Allied fighters were simply short-range fighters that had drifted with the westerly wind.2!8 As a result Goering continued to insist that the primary task of the fighters was still to break up the bomber formations and to ignore the escort fighters. This was, of course, a quite correct view in a situation where the Allies possessed no long-range fighter and the Germans large numbers of fighters; but since neither was in fact the case the delusions of the Luftwaffe commander-in-chief postponed for even longer the establishment of a satisfactory defence strategy to cope with Allied attacks. German capability should be retained. The irony was that the Luftwaffe had been unable to sustain such a capability with any serious military effect during the winter of 1940-41 when there was httle industrial targets offered to Allied bombers.?!6 Under such circumstances it
