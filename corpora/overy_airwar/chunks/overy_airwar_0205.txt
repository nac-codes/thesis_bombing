een unable to sustain such a capability with any serious military effect during the winter of 1940-41 when there was httle industrial targets offered to Allied bombers.?!6 Under such circumstances it was perhaps surprising that the Luftwaffe achieved such success against bombers in 1943 that both the RAF and AAF fighters were simply short-range fighters that had drifted with the westerly wind.3!8 As a result Goering continued to insist that the primary task of the fighters was still to break up the bomber resources were, on the contrary, very limited. The consequence was that as Allied fighters penetrated further into the Reich, the German fighters were never able to get close enough to the bombers in enough strength to inflict a high loss rate, let alone to break the formations up. The weakness of the Luftwaffe in the west was thus compounded of a lack of strategic priority and direction on the one hand, and tactical uncertainty on the other.#12 While Hitler himself predicted in September 1943 that the mastery of the air would be regained for Germany in ‘two to three months’,3?° the Luftwaffe generals saw that the air war had a quite different character. Even the pause in the Allied air offensive, and the reasons for it, were not fully appreciated on the German side. For the Luftwaffe there were permanent difficulties to be overcome. The crucial years in the build-up of Luftwaffe strength had been in 1940-42. The multiplication of tasks and the insufficiency of resources from these years had inflicted weaknesses that could not be overcome later in the war. The loss of initiative had produced an unbalanced air force as the bomber programme had to be cut back progressively in favour of fighters.32! This tendency had been present even before 1939 as those favouring tactical air forces came to dominate the staff, and had been continued into the war after the failure of strategic bombing in 1940, and as the demands for fighter and ground attack aircraft from the eastern
