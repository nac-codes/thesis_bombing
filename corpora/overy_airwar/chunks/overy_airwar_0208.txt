deterioration in German morale. Air officers lacked confidence in their superior commanders; so much so that many tactical novelties were introduced at the front without being referred back to the authorities in Berlin. Morale was sapped, too, by the growing disillusionment of Hitler and the Nazi Party with the Luftwaffe’s performance. The effects of bombing on the civilian population brought constant recriminations on the Luftwaffe from the local party administrators, and Hitler’s own attacks on the air force leaders was a mixture of fear at the political consequences of continued bombing raids and desperation at the inability to offer adequate air protection to the armies that he was painfully withdrawing across Europe.22° His disillusionment went so far that he finally ordered that the Luftwaffe should be disbanded and replaced by a vast anti-aircraft defence force. Although Goering was able to save his air force by appeals to past loyalty, Hitler refused to allow the Chief of Air Staff to enter the Supreme Headquarters for two months and kept up a personal vendetta against the Luftwaffe officers who were accused of cowardice, showmanship and corruption.326 The only hope that Hitler held out was that some secret weapon would emerge in the air war which would give the initiative back to Germany. The V1 and V2 were thus given great priority in the belief that as a result of rocket attacks on London there would be ‘such a storm of protest and war- weariness that the Government will be overthrown’.327 When General Dornberger, responsible for the development of rockets, revealed to Hitler that the military value of the V2 was very limited Hitler angrily replied: ‘But what I want is annihilation!’328 Hitler had always treated air power as a terror weapon. In the final desperate months of war all serious development work was sacrificed in the effort strengthening German defences.#17 Combined with a policy of large-scale production and a lead in radar technology air supe
