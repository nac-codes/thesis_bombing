erate months of war all serious development work was sacrificed in the effort strengthening German defences.#17 Combined with a policy of large-scale production and a lead in radar technology air superiority passed to the Allies even over Germany itself. While Galland and hand, and tactical uncertainty on the other.32 While Hitler himself predicted in September 1943 that the mastery of the air would be regained for Germany in ‘two to three months’,32° the Luftwaffe generals saw that the air war had a quite strength per month.322 The higher the initial loss rates, the longer it took to build up sufficient stocks for future operations. Hitler’s own attitude towards reserves made the task of conserving armies that he was painfully withdrawing across Europe.32° His disillusionment went so far that he finally ordered that the Luftwaffe should be disbanded and replaced by a vast anti-aircraft defence to find the final war-winning secret weapon without which, as Hitler now realized, the war was lost. By this stage, however, the Luftwaffe had long ceased to be able to function properly. The air war lacked any firm direction either strategically or operationally. Resources had fallen to a mere fraction of what was necessary. Lacking material and purpose German airmen were volunteering for active service at the front with ground armies which, despite the lack of effective air support had succeeded in holding up the Allied armies in almost two years of retreating.322 (vi) Air Power and the War in Europe  The successful exercise of air power was slow to mature in the heat of actual conflict after 1941. For one thing it was by no means certain what ‘successful’ meant. German air power in 1940 had certainly been successful in the land campaigns, even though the Luftwaffe was defeated later through its failure to do more than support the German army. Allied air power had finally achieved air supremacy by the end of the war, but there was considerable confusion at the time as to wh
