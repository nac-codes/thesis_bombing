The difference in strategic circumstances also encouraged other differences as a direct result. Having more time to plan and prepare air warfare, the Allies were in a position to experiment with particular strategies and tactics and arrive at the best use of air power by a process of elimination. Germany once committed to the war in Russia, never had the same degree of time to think air power out properly, nor could sufficient intellectual or practical effort be diverted from the Eastern Front to pursue other air doctrines with any hope of success. That was made clear by the constant failure to mount a renewed bombing offensive of any value at all after the failure of the Blitz. The German high command was by no means unaware of alternatives. In fact the navy and air force staffs constantly demanded more air activity of an independent and offensive character. There were too many problems to overcome, however, to lift the Luftwaffe at short notice from a close- support force to the multi-purpose force wielded by the Allies. Where the Allies from the outset laid great store by the massive production of aircraft and resources for air warfare, the Luftwaffe was always in second place behind the army even had it used its industrial resources more productively. Where the Allies allowed the air force considerable latitude in finding the right strategy, and gave considerable freedom of command, t
