rmy even had it used its industrial resources more productively. Where the Allies allowed the air force considerable latitude in finding the right strategy, and gave considerable freedom of command, the Axis forces were the prey of poor leadership which progressively abandoned authority over the air forces to the army, and to a limited role. Finally, the emphasis on science and technology that a general air strategy required, and which the western powers obligingly supplied, was insufficient in the Axis powers except for the more limited exercise of air power. This was true also for Russia, where aircraft production and research was concentrated almost exclusively on the requirements of the battlefront.  Above all there developed a clear difference in strategic emphasis. The Western Allies happily embraced air power as one of the most important instruments for achieving victory. The air force, particularly in Britain, had as much status and prestige as the army, and air strategy was widely discussed and examined at the highest level. In Germany the army enjoyed enormous prestige and Hitler, involved in the day-to-day running of the army machine, paid relatively little attention to the Luftwaffe. After he witnessed the failure of the air force in 1940 he was little persuaded of the vital importance of general air power, and alternative air strategies featured little in strategic discussions. Under such circumstances it was perhaps not surprising that when the war situation made it possible the Allies opted for the general use of air power in bombing, blockade, land support and the naval war; and the Axis for land support alone. The difference in emphasis then became in itself an important explanation as to why the Allies won the war in the air and not the fascist powers.  The second question, of how important air power was in explaining the Allied victory as a whole, was much harder to decide. The fact that it was important was not in doubt. General air strategy was
