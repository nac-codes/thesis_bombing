k of German forces to a land war, and hence encourage the Luftwaffe in its more limited role, but 4 ~ The Air War in the Far East  Japan’s war against the western powers possessed a strong sense of military unreality. It was clear that the United States would be able to use its vast material superiority to defeat Japan, though how long this would take depended on the course of the war in Europe. Both the Japanese offensive and the Allied response were more dependent on the use of air power than was the case in Europe with its traditional and influential land armies. For the Japanese, air power made up for naval inferiority and provided a flexible and versatile weapon with which to defend the projected ‘southern region’ of conquest. For the Allies aircraft formed a vital first line of defence in a weakly defended area, and when that line had been breached provided both the means to return to the offensive, a defence for major lines of communication and a means of communication in its own right. In the Pacific air power was linked closely with sea power and the emphasis that both the Japanese and American navies had placed on the aircraft carrier and marine aviation in the 1930s was fully justified by the events of the war. In China and south-east Asia land-based aircraft were also of great importance in keeping open lines of supply and in giving tactical support to land armies. In India the British depended on strategic air defence, as in 1940 over England, before forces could be built up for a combined attack on the Japanese positions in Burma and southern China. Because of this concentration on the strategic use of aircraft the winning of air supremacy was regarded as an essential prelude to the fulfilment of more general strategic ambitions. The Japanese inability to maintain the supremacy temporarily wrested from the Allies in early 1942, and the Allied determination to build up massive and diversified air power before resources for invasion could be diverted fro
