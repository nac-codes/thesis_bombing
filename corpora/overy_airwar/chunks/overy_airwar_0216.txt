maintain the supremacy temporarily wrested from the Allies in early 1942, and the Allied determination to build up massive and diversified air power before resources for invasion could be diverted from the European theatre, led to the final defeat of Japan through blockade and destruction from the air.

One of the most important was the achievement of a non-aggression pact with Russia without which the risk of a southward invasion was too great. Throughout the late 1930s Japan had kept large air forces in the north against the Russian threat. A precondition of further imperialism was the neutralization of this threat.331 When a pact was finally achieved in April 1941 it freed part of the Japanese army in Manchuria and allowed the movement south of aircraft for operations in South East Asia.332 The second factor was the rapid shift in the course of the European war. By mid-1941 Japan was entitled to expect that Germany would defeat Britain and Russia within a short period of time, leaving the United States isolated. The European war had denuded the Far East of western forces and it became increasingly obvious that only in 1941 would the balance of forces so favour Japan that  Page 93 of 309 33% Japan's war against the western powers possessed a strong sense of military unreality. It was clear that the United
