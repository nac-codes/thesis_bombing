at only in 1941 would the balance of forces so favour Japan that  Page 93 of 309 33% Japan's war against the western powers possessed a strong sense of military unreality. It was clear that the United States would be able to use its vast material superiority to defeat Japan, though a decisive military blow could be struck that might persuade America to accept Japanese imperialism. The temporarily favourable strategic situation masked more pressing long-term arguments for war. The army and navy, although with very different strategic perspectives, nevertheless recognized the need to preserve the Japanese empire in China for reasons both political and economic. Both recognized, too, that the economic blockade to which Japan was exposed, because of the Chinese war, was undermining at an accelerating rate the ability to maintain the armed forces and hence any imperialism at all. In this the question of oil was crucial. In August 1941 General Suzuki was ordered to investigate the success of the plans for synthetic oil production inaugurated in the 1937 Synthetic Oil Industry Law. He reported that large new investments were necessary which would not produce the necessary oil until 1943-44 333 Even before this report the Japanese navy had already reached the conclusion that the deteriorating economic situation justified war, however reluctantly such a decision might be taken. For the navy the ideal time to strike was in late 1941 before American forces were built up in the Pacific and before the oil situation became critical, though Yamamoto was sceptical of his ability to defeat America in the long term.334 For the army war only became unavoidable when it became clear at the end of November 1941 that America would not reach a negotiated settlement unless Japan voluntarily abandoned her conquests in China. In both cases it had been hoped that war could be avoided; from the armyâ€™s point of view because a favourable conclusion to the war with China first would have meant the
