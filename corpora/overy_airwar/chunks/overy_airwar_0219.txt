mbination of aerial striking-power and naval mobility that Imperial General Headquarters adopted.33° Studies for the execution of an attack were carried out in the wake of the successful British attack at Taranto, and war exercises in April and May 1941 confirmed its feasibility. By June 1941 Yamamoto ordered the preparation for mobilization and by the autumn Japan had 6 fleet carriers, 4 large fleet carriers and a total naval front-line strength of 1,400 aircraft which were to be deployed in an eastward strike against the United States base at Hawaii, and a southward movement to capture British and Dutch possessions in the south Pacific.337 The army’s preparations were less extensive because of the need to maintain some forces in Manchuria in case of Russian aggression; to continue the fight against the Chinese forces; and to defend mainland Japan. In consequence only 11 army divisions and two air divisions of some 700 aircraft could be diverted southwards for the capture of Burma, Malaya and the Dutch East Indies.338  The war with China had given much experience to both the army and navy in establishing air tactics and in organizing air forces to achieve maximum effect and satisfactory co-operation with the parent service. The army had originally organized aircraft in regiments of mixed types (hiko rentai) but these were replaced during the Chinese war by Groups (sentai) which were smaller, more flexible and more specialized. The navy organized aircraft in naval air corps (kokutai) usually of one aircraft type and attached either to a fleet or an area as the tactical situation required.322 Use of bombers and dive-bombers on both sea and land targets had been perfected over China and in the China Sea and incorporated into naval planning through the recommendations of the Battle Lessons Committee set up during the Sino-Japanese conflict.34° Considerable stress was laid on the acquisition of good aerial intelligence and this, combined with an insistence on the need f
