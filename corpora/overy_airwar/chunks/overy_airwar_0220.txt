In 1940 only 4,768 aircraft were produced divided between the two services; in 1941 this total had risen to only 5,088.341 Although this represented an increase of over 300 per cent against production in the first year of the Chinese war, the new war plans envisaged stretching the resources over three wide fronts against potentially powerful air enemies.
