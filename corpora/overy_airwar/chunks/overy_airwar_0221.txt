00 per cent against production in the first year of the Chinese war, the new war plans envisaged stretching the resources over three wide fronts against potentially powerful air enemies. Moreover the army aircraft did not compare well with the advanced aircraft of the Allies, and while those of the navy were more than adequate for the task in 1941 of defeating ageing and obsolete Allied aircraft they, too, could not match in speed or firepower the new generation of American and British models. Since much of this disparity was known in Japan, and since some of it was related to a lack of raw materials, the swift creation of a defensible southern region rich in resources, achieved largely through air power exercised by ships, was calculated to be the best use to which Japanâ€™s limited forces could be put. Japanese intelligence on Allied strength in the Far East was largely correct. Britain could not afford to keep large forces in the area particularly as preparations were in hand for a fresh offensive against Rommel and a future invasion of Europe. America, although beginning to rearm in sufficient measure to provide better defence in the Pacific, was obliged to send most of the modern equipment to Britain and Russia and had already subscribed to the British decision that victory in Europe must be secured first at the expense of anything more decisive in the Far East should Japan take the offensive. The relative weakness of the two powers was to a certain extent offset by the continued involvement of China in the war. Just as the western powers benefited from the German- Russian conflict so the Sino-Japanese war was thought to tie down sufficient Japanese forces to make any further imperialism unlikely.242 American intelligence was in this respect misled. Arguing that Japan could not move both east and south at the same time stress was put on reinforcing the meagre forces in the Philippines as the most likely area for any future Japanese attack.
