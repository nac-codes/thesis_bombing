n could not move both east and south at the same time stress was put on reinforcing the meagre forces in the Philippines as the most likely area for any future Japanese attack. Yet so unprepared for the actual outbreak of war were American forces that aircraft were huddled together in large groups on the airfields in the belief that sabotage was a greater threat than air attack.343 The element of surprise in the Japanese attack was as complete as that of the German forces in Russia in June 1941. This kind of error reflected on the part of the United States, not an unwillingness to defend the Pacific area seriously, but a rational strategic calculation that the risk of actual war in the Pacific was more remote than the risk of war with Germany. The plan to reinforce and reorganize forces in the Pacific in late 1941 was intended to act as a deterrent hv showing American intention to defend her nosition at same future date should the need arise. The reinforcement relied to a sreat  Page 94 of 309 34% ae a a Sg re -_ a a, ee ae eins  that Imperial General Headquarters adopted.326 Studies for the execution of an attack were carried out in the wake of the successful British attack at Taranto, and war exercises in April and May 1941 and more specialized. The navy organized aircraft in naval air corps (kokutai) usually of one aircraft type and attached either to a fleet or an area as the tactical situation required.32Â° Use of bombers elsewhere. In 1940 only 4,768 aircraft were produced divided between the two services; in 1941 this total had risen to only 5,088.34 Although this represented an increase of over 300 per cent against Russian conflict so the Sino-Japanese war was thought to tie down sufficient Japanese forces to make any further imperialism unlikely.342 American intelligence was in this respect misled. Arguing forces in the Pacific in late 1941 was intended to act as a deterrent by showing American intention to defend her position at some future date should the
