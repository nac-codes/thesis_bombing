rmy divisions and two air divisions of some 700 aircraft could be diverted southwards for the capture of Burma, Malaya and the Dutch East Indies.#** and more specialized. The navy organized aircraft in naval air corps (kokutai) usually of one aircraft type and attached either to a fleet or an area as the tactical situation required.33° Use of bombers set up during the Sino-Japanese conflict.242 Considerable stress was laid on the acquisition of good aerial intelligence and this, combined with an insistence on the need for surprise, was put to good time uncoordinated into the overall air defence scheme. In Alaska and the northern Pacific only two radar sets were available by late 1941, again on an experimental basis. In fact the whole radar programme was only inaugurated in May 1940 after inspection of the British system, and although widely introduced after the Japanese attacks, it was still unavailable on more than a rudimentary basis to give intelligence of surprise attacks in December 1941.34¢  Once hemisphere defence was organized, greater attention was given to defending Hawaii and the Philippines in the hope that any future war could be contained away from the mainland. In November 1940 a Hawaiian Air Force was created designed to be built around a complement of heavy bombers, the first of which arrived in May 1941. In July 1941 a study produced on ‘The Air Situation in Hawaii’ called for permanent heavy-bomber patrols with a strength of 72 aircraft and a functioning radar screen to provide adequate protection against a carrier strike. Neither the screen nor the bombers were available fully by the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor.347 One reason for this was that reinforcements were directed south to the Philippines where an aggressive defence was to be established, again grouped around a force of heavy bombers. Although 272 were allocated to the region only 30 were available by December 1941. The remaining aircraft were obsolescent.348 The position of the Br
