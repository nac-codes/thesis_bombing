gy in which air power had an integral part to play.352 this route material could not easily be brought to either Russia or China, whose continued belligerency was essential for longer-term Allied strategy.358 A new supply route across the Pacific was also from the American west coast. The importance of air bases along the route was that adequate cover could be given to the movement of ships through the area, but it was also intended that aircraft should be flown direct across the Pacific to save shipping space and time. Moreover air transport aircraft could ferry supplies to key areas considerably faster than transport shipping. After some dispute as to jurisdiction over the activities of air transport both the army and navy agreed to the establishment in July 1942 of an Air Transport Command (equivalent in status to the other major AAF commands) charged with ferrying aircraft, personnel and supplies.352 The establishment of secure supply routes was a crucial precondition for any move to the offensive against Japan or indeed for the maintenance of a satisfactory defence. In fact the decision to seize islands in the Solomons in late 1942 was taken in the hope of forestalling Japanese attacks on the supply route.  Supply was just as important for the China theatre, for the loss of Burma gave responsibility for maintaining supplies to the air force. The India-China route provided the only way of reinforcing the Chinese forces and the Americans fighting with them. To carry out the reinforcement the AAF created the Tenth Air Force operating with headquarters at New Delhi. Among its tasks were the defence of India, the protection of the India-China route and the command of a China Air Task Force for actual operations in China itself.35Â° The main problems facing such a supply route lay in the lack of experienced personnel and sufficient transport aircraft or satisfactory air bases. In the face of such difficulties supply was only maintained for the political purpose of kee
