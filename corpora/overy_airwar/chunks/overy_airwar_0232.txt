route lay in the lack of experienced personnel and sufficient transport aircraft or satisfactory air bases. In the face of such difficulties supply was only maintained for the political purpose of keeping Chiang Kai-shek in the war at all. Only Stilwell and Chennault, the American commanders in the China-India theatre, remained convinced that China provided the best avenue for the future attack on Japan and that air forces deployed there could both wear down Japanese resistance and help to bomb distant economic targets. It was certainly true that the activities of the China Air Task Force helped to contain Japanese army air power in central and eastern China; but the major problem remained that insufficient resources could be flown in to mount any more elaborate air offensive, and that if the Japanese decided. as thev did in 1944. to hesin an offensive to eliminate the American threat. it was unlikely that Chinese and American forces could contain it and at the same time nravide a secure hase for S2CO1L VIIGMOIIE®E LU EVEL BICALEL LELILAL YY CILUELS LU GLIMOE VE MUL PLU OLig, VICLULY UVEL LIS LULA idl PUW CLO commands) charged with ferrying aircraft, personnel and supplies.3°? The establishment of secure supply routes was a crucial precondition for any move to the offensive against Japan or indeed for decided, as they did in 1944, to begin an offensive to eliminate the American threat, it was unlikely that Chinese and American forces could contain it and at the same time provide a secure base for bombing before the war had been brought to an end via the Pacific. Despite arguments for a more positive commitment to the China theatre, air activities remained largely diversionary rather than central to overall Allied strategy. The major attempt later in the war to use a series of bases in China for bombing Japan with B-29 ‘Superfortresses’, codenamed ‘Matterhorn’, broke down not only because of difficulties in supply and in airfield construction but because more suitabl
