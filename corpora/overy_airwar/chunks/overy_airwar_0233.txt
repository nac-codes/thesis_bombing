ies of bases in China for bombing Japan with B-29 ‘Superfortresses’, codenamed ‘Matterhorn’, broke down not only because of difficulties in supply and in airfield construction but because more suitable bases were secured more rapidly in the Pacific.361  American military strategy, like that of Japan, depended on the building up of large carrier and air forces in the central and south-western Pacific which would enable the Allies to move over from the defensive to what King called the ‘defensive-offensive’ stage of operations. The carriers had not been destroyed at Pearl Harbor and very rapidly the balance of carrier forces swung in favour of the United States through the swift expansion of a carrier and aircraft programme laid down in 1941, when the War Department had demanded industrial policies to utilize the ‘great economic and industrial advantage over our potential enemies...’.362 The number of aircraft planned for production for the American navy in 1942 exceeded total Japanese production for all purposes in 1942. Within only a few months of the attack at Pearl Harbor American forces were sufficient to prevent further Japanese expansion. The victories in the Coral Sea and at Midway, with better American intelligence and an imitation of Japanese carrier tactics destroyed any significant threat that Japan could pose in 1942 and early 1943 by eliminating the Japanese carrier force and the large part of its aircraft and trained crews.363 Within a further six months the offensive had been mounted in the Pacific islands with a growing disparity of forces in America’s favour. By January 1943 American front-line air-strength in the Far East already exceeded that of Japan and by January 1944 reached 11,442 against a Japanese strength of only 4,050,354 Moreover the successful Japanese strategy based on a combination of naval land-based bombers operating with well-protected carrier fleets was lost sight of in the course of 1943 while defending important land bases at Gua
