front-line air-strength in the Far East already exceeded that of Japan and by January 1944 reached 11,442 against a Japanese strength of only 4,050.364 Moreover the successful Japanese strategy based performing functions for which they had not been designed. Japanese defence of the perimeter depended on being able to maintain sufficient resources to prevent American incursions. The shortages of aircraft, resulting from economic conditions as much as from poor planning, meant that Japan very quickly found her own strategy reversed. Dispersed forces, the difficulty of concentrating forces in all areas under attack, declining intelligence on Allied plans and dispositions, and a very limited strategic view based narrowly on the instruction to defend every outer area to the limit, accelerated the attrition and destruction of the Japanese air forces.355 This situation had become obvious with the final destruction of the re-formed carrier fleets and air forces in the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf. In both cases the Japanese forces were considerably outnumbered. In the latter case insufficient knowledge of American intentions together with the insistence of the army that the Philippines should be defended at Luzon left too few aircraft for the decisive naval battle. The later army decision to defend at Leyte instead of Luzon played into the hands of the American carrier forces and speeded up the final re-occupation of Page 99 of 309 36% supply was just as important for the China theatre, for the loss of Burma gave responsibility for maintaining supplies to the air force. [he India-China route provided the only way of reinforcing defence of India, the protection of the India-China route and the command of a China Air Task Force for actual operations in China itself.25Â° The main problems facing such a supply route lay in the because of difficulties in supply and in airfield construction but because more suitable bases were secured more rapidly in t
