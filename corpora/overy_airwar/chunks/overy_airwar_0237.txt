he need for large increases in production. Air plans laid down for the period from January 1944 to August 1945 called for a total output of 97,000 aircraft. Economic restrictions reduced the plan to 66,000 and in the end only 40,000 could be produced, most of the aircraft being light fighters. The major bottleneck proved to be engine production. Over the same period only 56,000 engines were produced instead of the planned 105,000 and the ratio of engines to airframes produced fell from 2.3:1 in 1941 to 1:1 in 1945.37! The effect of this was to give a very short life to most aircraft for no satisfactory reserve of replacement engines could be built up. Despite the large increase in actual numbers produced the structure weight of the aircraft was small. The 5,000 aircraft produced in 1941 represented 26 per cent of the weight of American aircraft produced; the 28,000 in 1944 only 8 per cent.3”2 This shift reflected the fact that after 1942 the balance between bombers and fighters in the air force swung sharply in favour of fighters. In 1941 fighters totalled 21 per cent of all production, bombers 29 per cent. In 1943 the proportions were 43 per cent and 25 per cent: in 1945 49 per cent and 17 per cent.3”3 As with the Luftwaffe the swing was indicative of a loss of initiative in the air and made the task of restoring a balance and regaining a bomber striking capability much harder, particularly as the numbers of fighters produced was simply not adequate for the task of regaining air superiority.

The ca carriers had not been destroyed at Pearl Harbor and very rapidly the balance of carrier forces swung in favour of its aircraft and trained crews.3©3 Within a further six months the offensive had been mounted in the Pacific islands with a growing disparity of forces in America’s favour. By January 1943 American front-line air-strength in the Far East already exceeded tha
