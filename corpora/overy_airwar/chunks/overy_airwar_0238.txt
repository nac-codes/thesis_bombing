nths the offensive had been mounted in the Pacific islands with a growing disparity of forces in America’s favour. By January 1943 American front-line air-strength in the Far East already exceeded that of Japan and by January 1944 reached 11,442 against a Japanese strength of only 4,050.54 Moreover the successful Japanese strategy based plans and dispositions, and a very limited strategic view based narrowly on the instruction to defend every outer area to the limit, accelerated the attrition and destruction of the Japanese air forces.36> too few aircraft for the decisive naval battle. The later army decision to defend at Leyte instead of Luzon played i into the hands of the American carrier forces and speeded up the final re- occupation of the whole area.3®° | apa aged of all the 27 fleet ly isparity, encourage y King’s view that ‘our guiding policy is to achieve not mere a equacy, same time as German forces in Europe.?®2 Any hope that contact could be established between German and Japanese troops following a defeat of Allied forces in the Middle East or Russian forces in the Caucasus had disappeared only months after Japanese entry into the war.3”° The only way in which the southern region could be defended was through a large increase in material and trained produced instead of the planned 105,000 and the ratio of engines to airframes produced fell from 2.3:1 in 1941 to 1:1 in 1945.37 The effect of this was to give a very short life to most aircraft for no cent and 17 per cent.373 As with the Luftwaffe the swing was indicative of a loss of initiative in the air and made the task of restoring a balance and regaining a bomber striking capability much harder, That the number of aircraft produced was insufficient was demonstrated by the wide difference in strength between the Japanese and American air forces in the later stages of the war (see Table 6). Moreover the greater the disparity, the easier it became for the American air forces to eliminate those of the ene
