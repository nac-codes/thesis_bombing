Moreover the greater the disparity, the easier it became for the American air forces to eliminate those of the enemy, however substantial the increase in output. By 1944 the Japanese loss rate was so high that new production barely covered losses and there was no question of keeping reserves, as the following table demonstrates.

Against the new Allied aircraft even the Zero fighter was considerably inferior and other Japanese aircraft completely outmoded. Because few long-term plans had been made for replacements for existing aircraft models, the war saw both a hurr
