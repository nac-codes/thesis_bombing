Zero fighter was considerably inferior and other Japanese aircraft completely outmoded. Because few long-term plans had been made for replacements for existing aircraft models, the war saw both a hurried effort to find new types and a long series of modifications to existing models. The former effort failed largely because of the lack of design and engineering experience and the poor raw material position. The latter effort, although providing pilots with more weapons and armour protection, which earlier Japanese aircraft had lacked, made aircraft heavier and less manoeuvrable and resulted in many cases in an actual loss of performance  Page 101 of 309 36% ELLE LICOU LUE LAL EE LILLE AOED 11d PLUUUCLLU EE, Ladd PLALLS LAL UUW Ed LOE CA PELL LLU JALAL YY te LU SAU MOL 2 TD LALO LUE A LULL UU Uh Ff FY ALLEL ALE, DUO SEOUL ILEUS LOUMULOU Lie Picdlil LU cent and 17 per cent.23 As with the Luftwaffe the swing was indicative of a loss of initiative in the air and made the task of restoring a balance and regaining a bomber striking capability much harder, Japanese front-line American front-line December 1941-August 1945 army 17,760 8.700 over the war period. Competition between army and navy also complicated the introduction of new types by encouraging the development of too many new designs and spreading engineering resources far too thinly. The navy developed some 53 basic models with 112 variations, the army 37 basic and 52 variations. The jealous guardianship of a separate economic base for army and navy production led to much duplication and dispersion of effort. Both services developed machine-guns with different cartridges and electrical systems with different voltages.375 Nevertheless there were problems of supply and production about which little could be done. Throughout 1944 and 1945 an ever-increasing number of fighter aircraft had to be kept in homeland Japan for defence purposes. In June 1944 the number of home-defence fighters was 260, by July 1945 it had ri
