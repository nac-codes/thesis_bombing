hout 1944 and 1945 an ever-increasing number of fighter aircraft had to be kept in homeland Japan for defence purposes. In June 1944 the number of home-defence fighters was 260, by July 1945 it had risen to 500.376 Large numbers of aircraft had to be diverted as well to the Chinese theatre, to protect aircraft and raw material production and defend against bomber attacks. The most serious supply problems arose over raw materials and labour. Of these the most crucial were the shortages of aluminium and fuel oil. Even though great economies were made in the use of aluminium there was simply too little available to produce more than 40 per cent of the total aircraft planned. Shortages of fuel oil became so acute that all flight testing had to be abandoned and only one in ten aero-engines were tested before delivery.3”” Other material shortages, particularly of crucial alloy steels for engine output reduced the serviceability of naval aircraft from 80 per cent at the beginning of the war to as little as 20 per cent by the end, and partly accounted for why so many Japanese aircraft were destroyed on the ground.3”8 From the second quarter of 1942 Japanese fuel consumption exceeded total production and imports, and the gap was made up through the use of arge stocks built up before 1942. More fuel would have been available had the American blockade not been aimed at fuel supplies in particular. As it was there was too little fuel to keep naval and air forces in operation or to fuel those increases in production necessary to defend oil imports and break the blockade.372  American strategy was designed to take advantage of the weak economic position of Japan, first of all by overwhelming resistance through sheer numbers, secondly by a long-term programme  of blockade and attrition. In both enterprises the gaining of air superiority was vital. Aircraft, either from land bases or carriers, were the main instruments for carrying out the attrition of Japanese naval and air forces
