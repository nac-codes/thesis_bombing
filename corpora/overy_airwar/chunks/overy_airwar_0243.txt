the Battle of the Philippine Sea over 300 Japanese aircraft were destroyed for the loss of 23 American.38° The unequal battles were made worse for the Japanese forces because of the problem of training crews. In the early stages of the war great reliance had been placed ‘not in massed physical power, but in the perfection of expertness’ and the navy in particular had based its training on the ‘premise of the invincibility of a refined technique’.38! Hence the emphasis in design on a highly manoeuvrable carrier fighter. But the loss of the skilled cadres in the Battle of Midway and in the Solomons in 1942 left the Japanese air forces short of skilled training staff and reliant on pilots who could not be given the careful and lengthy training of the original crews because of the shortages at the front. Not only were Japanese aircraft heavily outnumbered but the quality of personnel declined sharply as well. By 1944 the operational loss rate of pilots in the Japanese navy had reached 50 per cent.382  Additional difficulties were created for Japanese forces by the American attrition of shipping which left front-line forces short of fuel, supplies and adequate maintenance facilities, all of which the American forces possessed in growing abundance, flown or shipped in along the Pacific supply routes. Shipping losses consisted of both naval and merchant ships, although the air forces inflicted much greater losses on the former. Table 7 shows the total loss of Japanese warship and merchant tonnage and the cause. December 1941-August 1945 army 17,760 planned. Shortages of fuel oil became so acute that all flight testing had to be abandoned and only one in ten aero-engines were tested before delivery.277 Other material shortages, particularly of forces in operation or to fuel those increases in production necessary to defend oil imports and break the blockade.372 physical power, but in the perfection of expertness’ and the navy in particular had based its training on the ‘pr
