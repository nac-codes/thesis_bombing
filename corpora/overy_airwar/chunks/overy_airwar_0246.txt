as the defeat of Japan through the China-Burma-India theatre. This view had been held as a possibility earlier in the war. The plan consisted essentially of two features. Attacks by American and British ground forces against Burma, Malaya, and in China itself, combined with a programme of heavy-bombing to destroy the Japanese economy and will-to-resist without a full-scale invasion of the Japanese homeland. The two strategic views were not in all respects mutually exclusive and in the end the army initiative in both Burma and the Philippines was carried out successfullv.38© The main debate was about the nature combat aircraft for the final attack on Japan.385 Against this strategy there developed several army views. The first stage of the army strategy was the re-occupation of the Philippines and Formosa, strategic views were not in all respects mutually exclusive and in the end the army initiative in both Burma and the Philippines was carried out successfully.38© The main debate was about the nature and purpose of a bombing offensive, and raised again the issue never resolved in the European campaign as to whether bombing was simply a prelude to combined operations or an operation in its own right.  (iii) Bombing and the Collapse of Japan  Early bombing operations in Burma and south China were largely tactical, aiming at Japanese air strength, supplies and communications near the front, or giving support to ground operations in northern Burma and south China. Yet from the start Stilwell and Chennault had hoped that air operations in China, which constituted almost the only active military aid to Chiang Kai-shek, would be a prelude to more aggressive air strategy launched from a series of bases for attacking Japan and Manchuria with heavy bombers. The bases promised would, it was argued, be at risk but could be adequately defended by the Chinese air forces in preparation and being trained by Chennault, and by the American task force.38”7 The only major problem was s
