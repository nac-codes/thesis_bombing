In both India and China the problem was getting sufficient native labour. Nevertheless enough supplies were maintained to allow Chennault to expand the 14th Air Force towards the 500 aircraft he had originally suggested and to maintain a Chinese/American military presence in eastern China from which to attack Japanese ports and shipping, and to drive a wedge between the Japanese positions in northern Indo-China and around Hankow.?88 On the continued success of this enterprise depended the future prospect of a defeat of Japanese army forces in China and the carrying out of a successful China-based bombing offensive. It was under these circumstances that discussion opened in Washington over the future of strategic bombing in the east. In the Pacific and China areas one factor governing all bombing enterprises was range. Until bases could be captured close to Japan the only prospect of bombing was to produce an aircraft that could fly further. The B-29 ‘Superfortress’ was presented by Arnold as the weapon most suitable for Far Eastern bombing attacks, and although developed too late for wide use in Europe, it was available for the end of
