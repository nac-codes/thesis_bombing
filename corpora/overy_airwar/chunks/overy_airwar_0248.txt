. The B-29 ‘Superfortress’ was presented by Arnold as the weapon most suitable for Far Eastern bombing attacks, and although developed too late for wide use in Europe, it was available for the end of the Pacific war. In fact when it was originally conceived in 1939 one of its primary war tasks was expected to be the high-level bombing of Japanese industry.28? In May 1943 the decision was reached at the Trident conference to concentrate on a China initiative and to plan for the capture of Hong Kong and occupation of eastern China to provide a base to cut Japanese communications and bomb mainland Japan.3°° At Quebec in August the AAF had proposed in addition that huge new supplies be flown in via the India-China route to support a concentration of all the heavy bombers released from Europe in the event of an early German surrender. The proposal called for the construction of a chain of airfields on a 400 mile axis south and north of Changsa capable of handling the bombers, and in particular the ten groups of B-29 bombers scheduled for completion by October 1944. Arnold, calculating that the B-29 bases in the Marianas and Carolines would not be ready for over a year, endorsed the China plan and preparations were carried out for sending the supplies and bombers for carrying out ‘Matterhorn’.3%! Arnold, too, had been responsible for calling in early 1943 for a plan from the Committee of Operations Analysts for the best target systems in Japan suitable for a strategy of eliminating Japan from the war. The Committee’s emphasis on coke-ovens and hence steel as a top-priority target encouraged the China strategists since the  Page 104 of 309 38% to attack Japanese ports and shipping, and to drive a wedge between the Japanese positions in northern Indo-China and around Hankow.388 On the continued success of this enterprise depended the one of its primary war tasks was expected to be the high-level bombing of Japanese industry.3®° In May 1943 the decision was reached at the Tr
