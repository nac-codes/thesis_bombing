If invasion were necessary it was recommended that shipping, aircraft resources and urban areas be attacked together with other more obviously tactical targets. In the end the Joint Chiefs of Staff insisted that the latter priorities be followed, in the belief that invasion of mainland Japan was unavoidable.3%5 As a result the AAF found itself faced with the same problem of choosing between precise and indiscriminate targets that had confronted the Allied forces in Europe. Arnold had favoured precision bombing of aircraft industry targets at the opening of the campaign but tactical problems reduced their effectiveness and accelerated the move to area bombing from which the AAF had refrained as a primary target until late in the European war. In March 1945 the XXI Bomber Command commander, LeMay, demanded and secured permission for urban area attacks with fire-bombing techniques.2°° He justified such a demand by pointing to the level of heavy-bomber losses in precision attacks due to Japanese fighter defence. This was largely an excuse. The defence was scanty compared with the defence available in Germany in the early months of the Combined Bomber Offensive. Only 500 aircraft with low serviceability were available, including only two groups of night-fighters with poor radar.32” Because of the system of army command over air units, each fighter d
