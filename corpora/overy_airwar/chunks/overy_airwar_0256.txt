May 1945. Suicide pilots made around 2,940 sorties in the late stages of the Pacific War, hitting 402 Allied vessels. Imperial War Museum  The urban bombing campaign was carried out from January 1945. At first on precise economic targets, which involved a certain amount of indiscriminate destruction, but gradually moving to a general urban bombing offensive to demoralize the urban population and to take advantage of the extreme vulnerability of the Japanese cities to fire-bombing techniques. Arnold himself, under pressure from the American government to make use of the Iwo Jima assault to bring the war to the Japanese homeland and to speed up the war in the east, abandoned precision bombing of all except aero-engine factories and allowed LeMay to develop tactics that would bring the largest bomb-load most accurately over the major industrial centres. By May 1945 incendiaries comprised February 1945 August 1945 75 per cent of the bombload. Out of a total American tonnage of 153,000 tons dropped on Japan some 98,000 were fire-bombs.4 The results of the first series of operations, although disappointing from an American point of view because of the slight damage done to aircraft factories, were sufficiently effective militarily to encourage LeMay and a number of Washington planners to call for a target programme designed to end the war by bombing alone instead of using the bombing as a prelude to invasion. In a private letter in April 1945 LeMay wrote ‘I consider that for the first time strategic air bombardment faces a situation in which its strength is proportionate to the magnitude of its task. I feel that the destruction of Japan’s ability to wage war lies within the capability of this command...’403 Although the heavy bombers were diverted to help with the attack on Okinawa and to continue precision attacks on military targets, the bombing generals were given the opportunity to prove their point.
