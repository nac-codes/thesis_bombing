practised with greater ruthlessness and efficiency in the east than against the better-defended and less flammable targets in Europe. Japan, too, placed great emphasis on air power and devoted the largest sector of its war economy to aircraft production and output of aircraft carriers. The Japanese forces knew that the seizure of the ‘southern region’ could only be effected by using the imbalance of air forces in the Pacific to paralyse American naval power and overwhelm weak resistance in the colonial areas. The failure to defend the area later was due partly to a reversal of the balance of forces but also to the failure to see beyond the initial programme and to plan military strategy accordingly. In this the Japanese assault resembled that of Germany against the Soviet Union. In both cases there were insufficient preparations for alternative contingencies and too little attention to the longer-term economic and military requirements should the immediate strategic object not be achieved. In both cases air power was developed in a limited role. In Japan’s case it was primarily exercised in support of the navy. Admittedly, for Japan to be able to hold the outer perimeter successfully depended upon German success in Europe and the Middle East. Ironically Hitler hoped at the same time that Japan would keep America occupied in the Pacific leaving him with a freer hand in Europe.4% In the event, America was able to develop very large forces very rapidly to cope with developments in both theatres. Moreover air power in a variety of roles had a full part to play in all the Allied endeavours in the Far East, reflecting as in Europe the advantages to be won from the general exercise of air power. Founded on a decisive technical and industrial superiority, Allied air forces were used in support of army and marine assaults, in general support for the navy, in defending the threatened frontiers with the Japanese empire and in a variety of tactical and strategic bombing roles.
