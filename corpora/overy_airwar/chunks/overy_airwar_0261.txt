But even the carrying out of a bombing offensive did not settle the argument about whether it was worth the effort or not. This was the result of the difficulty in separating one circumstance from another in explaining the Axis collapse. But it was also the result of the nature of a bombing offensive itself. For many airmen it only made sense if it could ultimately achieve decisive results on its own and except for the rather special case of the atomic bombs this was not achieved beyond question.

Indeed until the failure of the Blitz the Luftwaffe, like the RAF, believed that bombing was an essential instrument when other forms of warfare had reached a stalemate. Nevertheless, a popular belief developed after the war that Ger
