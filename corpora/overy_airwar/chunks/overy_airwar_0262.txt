litz the Luftwaffe, like the RAF, believed that bombing was an essential instrument when other forms of warfare had reached a stalemate. Nevertheless, a popular belief developed after the war that Germany did not plan to mount a bombing offensive, even though the very opposite was in fact the case. After the death in 1935 of Wever, the Luftwaffe Chief of Staff who favoured strategic bombing, other prominent staff officers kept alive the idea. Goering himself sanctioned the search for a suitable heavy bomber in 1937, shortly after cancelling contracts for earlier heavy bombers doomed to relative obsolescence from the start. Goering and his technical staff recognized that the bombing plan was a long-term one governed by the lack of the available raw materials for an early build-up of bomber forces.4°8 Hitler, too, was attracted to bombing, particularly by its terroristic and deterrent character. But Hitler’s view of bombing was coloured by a number of misconceptions born partly of his personal isolation from air affairs, with which he was administratively quite out of touch, and partly of his ignorance of air strategy and aircraft planning.  The first misconception lay in his belief that the medium-bomber fleet could be used for strategic tasks without the need for heavy bombers. In Britain and America on the other hand, it was assumed from the outset that it was necessary to build special-purpose weapons for strategic air warfare. Hitler was persuaded of this because of the Luftwaffe’s tactical emphasis on dive-bombing, which was thought to be a much more efficient way of covering a target than by horizontal bombing, and because of the long range claimed for the new Luftwaffe medium bomber, the Junkers Ju 88.499 Another problem with mounting any bombing offensive that went beyond mere tactical support for ground operations lay in the fact that Hitler failed to give his forces sufficient indication of the direction in which his foreign policy was moving thus encouragi
