nt beyond mere tactical support for ground operations lay in the fact that Hitler failed to give his forces sufficient indication of the direction in which his foreign policy was moving thus encouraging the misconception that its aims were far more modest. Not until 1939 was the Luftwaffe instructed to prepare papers on the possibility of air attack against Britain. It was only in the same year that Hitler told the heads of the Wehrmacht that ‘The ruthless employment of the Luftwaffe against the heart of the British will-to- resist can and will follow at the given moment’.4!° Not only did the air staff not realize that England or Russia would be possible targets for long-range bombing in the immediate future, believing that any war would not come before 1942, but Hitler gave no clear-cut strategic direction to the air forces to prepare for a bombing campaign; lacking such a directive the air force rested on the complacent assumption that when the time came operational plans and the necessary material would be forthcoming.
