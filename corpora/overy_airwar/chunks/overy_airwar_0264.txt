oblem with mounting any bombing offensive that went beyond mere tactical support for ground operations lay in the fact that Hitler failed to give his forces sufficient indication of resist can and will follow at the given moment’4!° Not only did the air staff not realize that England or Russia would be possible targets for long-range bombing in the immediate future, believing that The situation in the west was different. In both Britain and America it was from within the air staffs themselves, indeed from within the tradition of the air services, that the view was developed that strategic bombing would play a crucial part in any later war. Nevertheless the important factor, demonstrated in the political influence on air planning in Germany, was the degree to which political leaders were attracted to the development, and later use, of bombing campaigns. Indeed in some cases the acceptance of bombing was an arbitrary fact, not necessarily reflecting an air force’s ability or willingness to bomb. Stalin’s rejection of long-range bombing was just such a case.4!2 In Britain, on the other hand, the RAF was fortunate that it was Churchill rather than Chamberlain who assumed responsibility for strategy in 1940. Churchill had been the political champion of bombing in the 1930s. Chamberlain had been responsible for some of the moves towards an international ban on bomber use in 1938 and 1939. It was unlikely that any British Prime Minister would have completely reversed the RAF emphasis on bombing, but it was much more likely that Churchill would deliberately encourage it.413 From the start Churchill gave bombing a high priority. Like Hitler he recognized its value as a political weapon as much as a military one. In 1940, for example, he promised as a political gesture ‘continuous and relentless air offensive’ and insisted that ‘on no account should the limited bomber force be diverted from accurate bombing of military objectives reaching far into Germany’ at a time when the
