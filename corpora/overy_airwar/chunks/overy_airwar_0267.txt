ts in favour of it. Although the emphasis on particular arguments altered with changes in the course of the war the arguments themselves changed very little. In the British case a major argument was the effect on public and international opinion. Indeed, one of the important considerations in the initial preparation of a bombing capability in the 1930s was the effect the absence of such a move would have on the electorate, whatever the military reasons for it. In 1940 the effect on the home population of promising and then initiating bombing attacks on Germany and Italy was argued as a justification in itself.418 In 1940 and 1941 bombing clearly was the main instrument for offensive action against the Axis powers. Churchill wrote to Beaverbrook in July: ‘when I look round to see how we can win the war I see that there is only one sure path. We have no Continental army which can defeat the German military power... there is one thing that will bring... [Hitler] down, and that is an absolutely devastating, exterminating attack by very heavy bombers from this country upon the Nazi homeland. We must be able to overwhelm them by this means, without which I do not see a way through.’*!2 The effect of bombing on international opinion was equally important. Not only did bombing demonstrate that British war capability was undiminished, it was also argued that it acted as a deterrent, though froma military point of view a not particularly important deterrent, on further Axis operations against the west. The impact of the bombing on American opinion was clear. Hopkins wrote to Churchill from Washington: ‘You have no idea of the thrill and encouragement which the Royal Air Force bombing has given to all of us here’,42° and Roosevelt’s interest in air strategy stemmed from the period in 1940 and early 1941 when he witnessed the successive efforts of the British forces to defeat the Luftwaffe and to seize the initiative in the air offensive.  Bombing assumed a fresh international
