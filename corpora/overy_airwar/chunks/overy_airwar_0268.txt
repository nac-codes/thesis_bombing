Bombing assumed a fresh international political significance when Germany invaded the Soviet Union. In answer to Stalin’s importunity Churchill offered the prospect of ‘a terrible winter of of 2,400 medium and 800 heavy bombers.4*11 towards bombing wavered with the actual course of bombing operations, he remained as he reminded Trenchard ‘a champion of Bomber Command’.4> In America bombing was met by a more cautious reaction. The air staffs had built up a body of doctrine around Mitchell's theory of strategic air power which was unattractive to the other services, bombing’ for Germany and continued throughout 1941 and 1942 to offer strategic bombing as the most decisive aid short of invasion that the west could provide.42!

In practical terms the strategy was designed to divert German resources from the Russian front and to reduce the German economy and hence keep Russia in the war, though its impact was not likely to be great at first. The same argument was used by the Americans in the Far East.
