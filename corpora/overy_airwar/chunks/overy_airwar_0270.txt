n was equally important. Not only did bombing demonstrate that British war capability was undiminished, it was also argued that it acted as a deterrent, though from a 1930s and that the programmes of development and training associated with bombing could not be ignored at the risk of huge wastage of military effort. Moreover since it was believed that Germany, too, was preparing to launch such an offensive it was argued that it was necessary to be able to mount a counter-offensive of greater sustained power than that of the enemy. This view remained intact even though British air defence had been set up to prove just the opposite, that bombers could not carry out an offensive in the face of heavy air opposition, a fact apparently confirmed by the failure of the Blitz. The positive purpose of a bombing offensive was essentially complementary to the general strategic aim of defeating the enemy power. This differed from the view held by the more extreme enthusiasts of the bombing strategy, but it was nevertheless the prevailing view. Bombing was a component part of a wider strategy, complementary to land invasion and to the exercise of tactical air power.423 In both America and Britain the principle of complementarity not only conformed to the wishes of the other services which refused to accept that any one service was capable of ending the war on its own, but conformed too to the air view that a successful air offensive was necessary before any surface invasion could be undertaken. There was never any widespread acceptance that armies had been rendered redundant by air forces, and the objectives sought by bombers were those best designed to contribute to the success of the other servicesâ€™ operations.424 Page 114 of 309 40% botn the American and britisn governments accepted a strategy that included bombing because there were important political and Military arguments 1n favour or it.
