German civilian morale was not included as a primary target in two main air plans drawn up in 1941 and 1942.42” American air intelligence believed that attacks against key economic systems, such as transport and electric power, would so demoralize the population that the same effects could be achieved without resorting to indiscriminate civilian bombing. Even against Japan, where urban bombing was much less discriminating, the arguments for urban bombing were based on the belief that Japanese industry was so dispersed among the small workshops and home industries of the cities that it was impossible to separate civilian from industrial targets. Moreover after the Imperial edict requiring all Japanese to fight for the defence of the homeland, American commanders treated all Japanese as military targets, thus eliminating any moral or strategic scruples that remained.428  The central target of the bombing offensives was not, however, morale but the economy.
