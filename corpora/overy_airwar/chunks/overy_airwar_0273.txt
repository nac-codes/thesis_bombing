, urged on by Hopkins, to expand air power in China and his final agreement that the first B-29s be operated from Chinese bases.42? In the case of Russia in 1942 and China in 1943 it attack on the economy.4?° The civilian attacks were justified further in 1941 by Portal’s argument that ‘the most vulnerable point in the German nation at war is the morale of her civilian population not included as a primary target in two main air plans drawn up in 1941 and 1942.42? American air intelligence believed that attacks against key economic systems, such as transport and electric ability of the Axis powers, and Germany in particular, to wage war would be undermined to such an extent that invasion and occupation would become relatively easy operations. The choice of which particular economic targets were the most vulnerable was left to the air staff planners to guess at. In Britain sharp differences of opinion developed before 1939 as to which were the most vulnerable targets. Oil, transportation, and the aircraft industry were regarded as crucial targets, but in what order they should be attacked depended upon operational experience which tended to confirm for the RAF that indiscriminate bombing of industrial targets was the best that could be hoped for.422 The American planning was more elaborate. Beginning from the premise that the German economy was already by 1941 stretched taut by the campaign in Russia, air intelligence suggested that certain targets were particularly susceptible to disruption. The major targets were the electric power system, transport — in particular the railway system — and oil and petrol industries and supplies. In 1942, in Air War Plan-42, aluminium and synthetic rubber were added, the latter because of the mistaken belief that a large proportion of the German army was motorized. Submarine bases and production were added in 1942 and 1943 in response to the threat to the Atlantic sea-lanes.422 One major difference between the British and American pl
