e German army was motorized. Submarine bases and production were added in 1942 and 1943 in response to the threat to the Atlantic sea-lanes.422 One major difference between the British and American plans was the emphasis placed on defeat of the enemy air force. In the AWPD-1 American air intelligence described neutralization of the German air force as an ‘intermediate objective, whose accomplishment may be essential to the accomplishment of the principal objectives’.421 Based on the experience of German attacks on Britain in 1940, and British attacks in 1941, the American air force planned to destroy or neutralize German air bases and aircraft production as a prelude to carrying out the bombing offensive at all. In Britain, although the German aircraft industry always maintained a high priority, the strategic bombing doctrine did not involve a preliminary requirement to neutralize or destroy the enemy air forces. Such neutralization would follow as a consequence of the general disruption to the economy after bombing attack.422 The switch to night bombing reflected this view, for continued day bombing required Page 115 of 309 A1% under air attack, and that until this morale has been broken it will not be possible to launch an army on the mainland of Europe with any prospect of success’.42® Morale, too, was presented as a not included as a primary target in two main air plans drawn up in 1941 and 1942.427 American air intelligence believed that attacks against key economic systems, such as transport and electric mistaken belief that a large proportion of the German army was motorized. Submarine bases and production were added in 1942 and 1943 in response to the threat to the Atlantic sea-lanes.42° One neutralization would follow as a consequence of the general disruption to the economy after bombing attack.432 The switch to night bombing reflected this view, for continued day bombing required that the RAF achieve a degree of air superiority for which it was neither sa
