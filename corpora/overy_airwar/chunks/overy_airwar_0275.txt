to the economy after bombing attack.432 The switch to night bombing reflected this view, for continued day bombing required that the RAF achieve a degree of air superiority for which it was neither satisfactorily equipped nor sufficiently persuaded of the need. Differences of emphasis, and even wider differences in intelligence estimates of the prospect of bomb attack, were a consequence of the large degree of strategic and operational ignorance surrounding a bombing offensive. Many of the effects expected from bombing were guesses and required a very much greater degree of faith in the results than was the case in making military or naval calculations. Because of such uncertainties there existed the temptation to look for much more strategic significance in bombing than the facts suggested. Hence, too, the rapid fluctuations between disillusionment and euphoria amongst those who supported bombing. Hitler, encouraged by Goering’s hope that Britain could be forced to surrender through the winter bombing campaign for which preparations were clearly inadequate, expressed his frustration that ‘the munitions industry... cannot be interfered with effectively by bombing’, even though he directed the air force to prepare for renewed bombing operations against Britain once the war in Russia was ended.423 In Britain the champions of bombing held out the prospect that bombing alone might end the  Page 116 of 309 41% all POWer a 1h VOUT ATMEL ICA Al Diltalli LIE PLiICIPNe OL COMPICIMCTILALILY MOL OLUY COMLOLTIMIEU LO LIE WiStles OF LITE OLTIEL SELVICES WILICHE TELUS LO ACCE VE Lildl dilly OLE SeLVICE Was Capavie Of Cllailis attack on the economy.425 The civilian attacks were justified further in 1941 by Portal’s argument that ‘the most vulnerable point in the German nation at war is the morale of her civilian population to prepare for renewed bombing operations against Britain once the war in Russia was ended.433 In Britain the champions of bombing held out the prospect that bo
