s the morale of her civilian population to prepare for renewed bombing operations against Britain once the war in Russia was ended.433 In Britain the champions of bombing held out the prospect that bombing alone might end the war without the need for invasion or armies, a prospect sufficiently attractive and stated with sufficient force to give it wide political currency.424 When Arnold visited London in 1941 Churchill's enthusiasm persuaded him that it was possible that ‘air power alone... might bring Germany so completely to her knees that it might be unnecessary for the ground forces to make a landing’.435 Thus encouraged the air planners in Washington included in the first air plan the strategic observation that ‘If the air offensive is successful, a land offensive may not be necessary’, a view reiterated forcefully in the Pacific theatre.43&  Nevertheless in practice real limits were set to the speculative and ambitious views of the bomber school. The ambiguous and unpredictable nature of air power was recognized by those who planned overall military strategy. Charged with the more pressing task of producing a military and economic plan that might realistically defeat the fascist powers, the Chiefs of Staff and later the Combined Chiefs gave bombing only a component, and in some respects a minor role to play in these plans. Given the opposition to strategic bombing among the military and naval establishment, the very survival of the policy depended on political protection and vigorous dogmatism on the part of the air forces. At Casablanca faith in the bombing offensive, which had not as originally conceived yet taken place, was fought for against the rival claims of the armies faced at last with the prospect of land war in the near future. Bombing emerged as one of five forms of offensive action with the the RAF that indiscriminate bombing of industrial targets was the best that could be hoped for.42° The American planning was more elaborate.
