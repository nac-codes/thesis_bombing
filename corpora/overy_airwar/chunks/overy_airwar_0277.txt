Beginning from the premise that the German economy mistaken belief that a large proportion of the German army was motorized. Submarine bases and production were added in 1942 and 1943 in response to the threat to the Atlantic sea-lanes.43° One neutralization would follow as a consequence of the general disruption to the economy after bombing attack.*32 The switch to night bombing reflected this view, for continued day bombing required war without the need for invasion or armies, a prospect sufficiently attractive and stated with sufficient force to give it wide political currency.424 When Arnold visited London in 1941 Churchill’s enthusiasm persuaded him that it was possible that ‘air power alone... might bring Germany so completely to her knees that it might be unnecessary for the ground forces to make a landing’.45 forcefully in the Pacific theatre.43¢ main emphasis on invasion by surface forces.437 Later developments in 1943 confirmed that bombing was a complementary policy, primarily to help in the final land assault in Europe, performing ‘strategic’ air operations for the purpose of tactical support. Despite the opposition of those who argued for an independent bombing policy, the arguments in favour of bombing had from the start insisted that bombing was one part of the general plan, not an alternative to it. (ii) Problems of Execution: Technology and Intelligence  Actual operational experience with bombing altered the emphasis on particular targets and introduced tactical debates, particularly over the usefulness of precision as opposed to area bombing, which became superimposed on the wider debate over strategy. The most important change, since it affected the ability to mount any offensive at all, was in the importance attached to defeating the opposing air force. The Blitz had
