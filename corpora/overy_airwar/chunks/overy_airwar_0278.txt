e wider debate over strategy. The most important change, since it affected the ability to mount any offensive at all, was in the importance attached to defeating the opposing air force. The Blitz had already demonstrated that well-organized passive defences combined with good fighter interception could defeat daylight bombing and effectively disrupt bombing by night. There was little evidence to suggest that Germany was any less well defended than Britain had been in 1940. The complete failure of early RAF bombing raids by day confirmed sucha view. The only solution was to so overwhelm or undermine the opposition that bombing could continue without interruption. Overwhelming the defences was largely out of the question, and was successfully achieved in the early stages of the offensive in the attack against Cologne only because of the defence’s complete lack of preparation for so heavy a blow. The alternative of undermining the air force by direct attacks and attacks on the aircraft industry could only be undertaken when sufficient fighter cover could be provided into Germany and when attacks of sufficient precision could be made to destroy individual industries. As the American planners had realized the only way to achieve a strategic result by bombing was to use the bomber itself as an instrument for securing  Page 116 of 309 42% ee neutralization would follow as a consequence of the general disruption to the economy after bombing attack.422 The switch to night bombing reflected this view, for continued day bombing required a ae ee a forcefully in the Pacific theatre.43® air supremacy. Operation ‘Pointblank’ was established for precisely this purpose, and although there was some resistance to the operation on the grounds that it was using bombers for preparing the way for land invasion and hence diverting the bombing effort from its principal objective, the judgement that ‘the successful prosecution of the air offensive against the principal objectives is dependen
