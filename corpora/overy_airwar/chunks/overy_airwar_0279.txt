for land invasion and hence diverting the bombing effort from its principal objective, the judgement that ‘the successful prosecution of the air offensive against the principal objectives is dependent upon a prior (or simultaneous) offensive against the German fighter strength’ was generally accepted.438 The second question raised by the experience of operations was the more difficult one of whether daylight precision bombing or night bombing was the more effective. The debate about precision bombing was more bitter because it did not divide services, but allies. The British and German experience in the winter of 1940-41 confirmed that under prevailing technical conditions daylight bombing was too costly, and that night bombing was too inaccurate for the attack on precise targets. The RAF had the choice of awaiting a technical solution to the problem of daylight precision bombing or adovting the bombing of urban areas: the inclination of its doctrine and the volitical pressure for retaliation on Germanv hastened the adoption of the latter course.

The complete failure of early RAF bombing raids by day confirmed such a bombing or adopting the bombing of urban areas; the inclination of its doctrine and the political pressure for retaliation on Germany hastened the adoption of the latter course. Once adopted, and with elaborate target plans laid for area bombing, it became all the mo
