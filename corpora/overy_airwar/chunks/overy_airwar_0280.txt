its doctrine and the political pressure for retaliation on Germany hastened the adoption of the latter course. Once adopted, and with elaborate target plans laid for area bombing, it became all the more difficult to change to alternative tactics and alternative targets. Even when Portal presented Harris with the means to adopt more economical precision bombing later in the war, the commitment of Bomber Command and its commander to the original decision was almost impossible to reverse.*22 Moreover the RAF sought to impose its tactical view on the American air forces in the belief that daylight precision bombing would be a waste of effort. Churchill in particular, disturbed, like Hitler, at the poor results of attacks on individual targets, pressed the AAF to conform to the British tactics at almost exactly the time that Portal began to express the view that precision attacks were now technically feasible and strategically desirable.44Â° The RAF by concurring with American plans was able to leave the task of achieving air supremacy largely to the 8th Air Force by day, while leaving Bomber Command free to continue the search for war-winning bomber attacks at night. There were other reasons. The division of labour satisfied any anxieties caused by the renewed arguments over bombing tactics, for this had once again encouraged those opposed to bombing in Washington to call for the redeployment of the European heavy bombers. The additional argument that round-the-clock bombing would stretch German defence resources even more was true onlv to a limited extent since a large davlight defence had to be kent on a nermanent footing in Germanv anvwav. against the time when dav gf yet taken place, was fought for: against the rival claims of the armies faced at last with the prospect of land war in the near future. Bombing emerged as one of five forms of offensive action with the main emphasis on invasion by surface forces.432 Later developments in 1943 confirmed that bombing was a
