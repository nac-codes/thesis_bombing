f land war in the near future. Bombing emerged as one of five forms of offensive action with the main emphasis on invasion by surface forces.432 Later developments in 1943 confirmed that bombing was a complementary policy, primarily to help in the final land assault in Europe, performing 0 — dependent upon a prior (or simultaneous) offensive against the German fighter strength’ was generally accepted.428 more economical precision bombing later in the war, the commitment of Bomber Command and its commander to the original decision was almost impossible to reverse.432 Moreover the RAF sought stretch German defence resources even more was true only to a limited extent since a large daylight defence had to be kept on a permanent footing in Germany anyway, against the time when day attacks might begin again. Large air defence forces had been similarly tied down in Britain since 1940 against the day when Hitler would renew his attempt at conquest from the air. The tactical debates, however, were overshadowed throughout the bombing campaigns by two factors that decisively conditioned the nature and success of bombing: the collection and use made of intelligence and the state of bombing technology. Intelligence was a crucial part of the bombing campaigns. It was necessary not only to predict the most suitable targets and priorities, but for the equally important task of surveying bomb damage and overall results. No air force had begun to gather and assess the necessary intelligence required for launching a strategic offensive before war broke out. The RAF had established the Air Targets Sub-Committee in June 1936 to co-ordinate intelligence from various departments on the German economy and possible targets within it, but the amount of actual effort devoted to such intelligence was small and fell far short of what was required for the projected bombing.44! Photo-reconnaissance was only carried out on a systematic basis from 1938 and then with only the smallest of staffs.442
