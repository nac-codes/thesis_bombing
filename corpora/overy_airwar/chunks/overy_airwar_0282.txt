was small and fell far short of what was required for the projected bombing.44! Photo-reconnaissance was only carried out on a systematic basis from 1938 and then with only the smallest of staffs.442 In Germany air intelligence was limited to acquiring good topographical material on Britain and France together with information on the current structure of the economy. The choice of targets in the Blitz was largely confined to aircraft industrial targets in order to prepare for the temporary air supremacy required for invasion. Very little high level appreciation of the weak and vital sectors of the British economy took place.443 On the outbreak of war Bomber Command was able to draw more heavily on economic intelligence from the Ministry of Economic Warfare and from the expanded air intelligence sections. On this basis target systems based around oil and communications were chosen as those most exposed to attack and most vital to the German economy.â€œ Full details were rapidly assembled on a wide variety of targets and the information disseminated throughout Bomber Command.  It was at this point that intelligence emerged not only as an instrument of bombing policy, but as its severest critic. Throughout 1940 and 1941 Bomber Command, on the basis of detailed target intelligence, encouraged the belief that bombing was accurate and the targets selected crucial for the German war economy. It was the development of post-operational intelligence that exposed the claims as grossly exaggerated. Bomber Command was protected in 1940 by the fact that only one bomber in four carried a camera, and in many cases the cameras carried failed to record the actual bomb hits and hence the likely damage. When the photographic intelligence increased in 1941 Lindemann called for an inquiry into the effectiveness of bombing in terms of the precise targets selected. The Butt renort showed that onlv 30 ner cent of the homhers arrived within five miles of the targets and in the Ruhr onlv 10 ne
