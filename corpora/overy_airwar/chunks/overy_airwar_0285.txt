rce doctrines on bombing and the attacks on ‘vital centres’. The recruitment of expert help in compiling such intelligence dictated to a certain extent the targets finally chosen. Electric power was selected because of the easy availability of details on electric power stations in the records of the large American banks that had loaned the money for their construction in the 1920s. The recruitment of an oil expert who had worked in Germany and Romania also gave added emphasis to oil as a target for which by 1941 target folders, aiming points and necessary bomb loads had been planned.448 Much intelligence came from the RAF, particularly on transportation and the aircraft industry, and was handed over to American air intelligence at almost exactly the time that the RAF was moving towards an area bombing policy.44° So extensive and detailed was the American target information that the War Plans Division planned on the precise basis of 66,045 sorties needed to destroy the nine major German target systems, and 51,480 sorties for the selected Japanese targets.45° Decisions based on intelligence were, as in Britain, subjected to a hostile and critical review during the actual course of operations. Not only was daylight bombing criticized because of its poor accuracy — a fact again based on post-operational intelligence — but the economic intelligence on which the whole bombing campaign was based was questioned by the Joint Intelligence Committee. To try and give more weight to the original, and hurried, estimates of German economic targets Arnold established a Committee of Operations Analysts to assess the probable impact of bombing on the ability of the Axis to continue fighting or to make an attack on Europe likely of success. The committee produced a list of 19 priority target systems but laid emphasis on the target systems already selected, and confirmed the air forces in the reliability of the initial strategic EQUALLY LUPO lallt Lao OL SULVEYITIE VOID Udillage dllitt
