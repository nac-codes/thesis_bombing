of economic targets had been considerably exaggerated, as had been the claims of the RAF in 1941.452  The criticisms from American air intelligence were sustained enough to encourage the deployment of heavy bombers in other roles and to confirm that strategic bombardment was from the view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff a preliminary to the actual surface invasion of Europe. Despite air force claims that the Combined Offensive would weaken or possibly destroy the German ability to wage war the conflicting intelligence, that the German war economy had considerably expanded in response to the bombing, encouraged the shift to selected targets for ‘Overlord’ just as it confirmed Harris in the wisdom of area bombing and the attack on morale. The advantage of both these targets lay in the fact that Harris did not have to produce quantifiable evidence — since morale in particular could not be quantified — in order to defend his bombing policy against the criticisms of scientific intelligence. Although intelligence gradually became available that morale was not cracking and that area attacks were less successful than had at first been supposed, Harris refused to accept the evidence, much of which was poorly corroborated. The claims of Bomber Command became as exaggerated during 1943 as they had been in 1941 now that they were once again free of the constraints of critical intelligence. In November he told Churchill that nineteen German cities had been completely destroyed and nineteen seriously damaged, that the Ruhr was ‘largely out’ and that he felt ‘certain that Germany must collapse’.453 In the face of large increases in war production discovered by the Ministry of Economic Warfare the claims of Bomber Command were clearly false. That such discrepancy should exist was a product of the difficult circumstances under which intelligence had to be assessed. Much operational analysis was conducted in order to criticize bombing: much preparatory intelligence was designed to persu
