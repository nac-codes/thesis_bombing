Luftwaffe to mount a strategic bombing offensive. Poor engine performance and a host of minor technical difficulties delayed its introduction. Imperial War Museum For the first years of the war Britain suffered from the same problem. The aircraft with which the bombing offensive was undertaken until the middle of 1942, and including the 1,000 bomber raid on Cologne, were essentially similar to those employed by the Luftwaffe and suffered from the same disabilities. The difference between the two sides arose from the fact that from the mid-1930s both the RAF and the American air forces, in accordance with the emphasis placed upon strategic bombing, had planned for a range of heavy bombers to replace the medium machines in the early AANA 487 Te La al Aloe n2-tat.. baa t An--21 feeaateatnn see rs een en tees 2 Lae ale Leeann nbnt ani aed nba: 1940s.457 In both countries it took time to overcome the technical difficulties both in developing and producing in quantity a large aircraft, but the technical limitations imposed on bombing were largely removed with the development of the Lancaster B-17, B-24 and B-29 (see Table 9 for a comparison of bomber aircraft performance). In the case of the B-29 it had for long been predicted that any war with Japan would require a long-range bomber because of the likelihood of having to mount an offensive against Japan from distant United States bases. The relationship between technique and strategy was in this case a highly dependent one.458 Table 9: Comparative Bomber Performance, United States, Britain and Germany Max. Unloaded Max.
