(b) in service with the RAF the B-24 had a maximum bombload of 12,800 over 990 miles and a maximum range of 2,290 miles. (c) range with an average bombload. Range with maximum bombload was 1,040 for the Lancaster and 1,370 for the Mosquito.  (d) including mines or missiles carried externally. Range with a full bombload was substantially reduced. On the He 177 A-1 it was only 745 miles.    Source: for Britain: O. Thetford Aircraft of the Royal Air Force 1918-1957 (London, 1957) pp. 66, 196, 301,451 for the United States: F. Swanborough & P.

The strategic implication of the heavy bomber policy was that the heavy aircraft with higher flying ceilings and better armament could not be so easily diverted from their targets as the medium bombers had been over England and Germany before 1942. But the problem of range was not only related to bombers but also to fighters. The ability of German fighters to fly higher and longer increased the rate of bomber loss. The increase in range and bombload had to be protected by long-range fighter aircraft. The tactical necessity for this had been predicted from early in the war and had been circumvented by the arguments that fighters with sufficient range were not technologically possible by 1943, and that the B-17 and B-24 were fast enough and well-armed enough to protect  thamoanle
