The increase in range and bombload had to be protected by long-range fighter aircraft.  The tactical necessity for this had been predicted from early in the war and  themselves.459 Neither argument was sustained by events. The heavy bombers could not protect themselves sufficiently in daylight raids. By the end of 1943 the search for a long-range fighter was  completed and the final technical barrier to carrying on an offensive was removed. The escort fighters were designed both to protect the bomb cargoes before reaching the target and to engage and destroy the enemy fighter forces. Until such a point was reached the balance of defensive against offensive technology favoured the former sufficiently to postpone the bombing as it had done in the  Blitz in the winter of 1940-41.46°  The technical restrictions placed on bombing through aircraft development were repeated in the question of bombs and the accuracy of their delivery. For one thing it took the RAF time to learn that incendiary bombs were more likely to damage targets than the high-explosive bombs available in the early stages of the war. In Germany the search for better bombs, particularly incendiary bombs, kept alive Goering’s hope of retaliation with a much smaller bomber force than that of the Allies, for both Goering and Hitler had from an early da
