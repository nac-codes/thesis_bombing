rch for better bombs, particularly incendiary bombs, kept alive Goering’s hope of retaliation with a much smaller bomber force than that of the Allies, for both Goering and Hitler had from an early date recognized the importance of fire-  bombing.4®! In Britain bomb research concentrated on large or special-purpose bombs for specific targets, such as the U-  boat pens in the attacks in 1943 and 1944. It was only the growing evidence  of how effective fire-bombs were, which came about with the switch to area bombing, that encouraged the RAF to place greater emphasis on them. The large high-explosive bombs were better suited  for precision attacks, particularly for the interdiction of communications. For the attacks on cities new incendiary techni section of a city into which the fire-bombs were to be aimed, and such techniques enormously increased the destructive had the same impact on life and property as the atomic attacks in 1945462  iques were developed, including the use of high explosive bombs to seal off a power of the conventional bomb attack. The firestorms in Germany and Japan  Even with new bombs, the bombers had to find the targets. Any decision about the type of bomb to be used was governed by the degree of concentration of bombs that could be achieved on a given target. It was the belief that bombing was highly inaccurate that discouraged precision bombing plans in Germany in favour of indiscriminate bombing over larger and more easily identifiable targets.  The same belief encouraged LeMay to move to area bombing of Japan because of the special difficulties in bomb-aiming t  hrough difficult weather conditions from a great height. The bombing of area  targets was the main tactic used from the Luftwaffe attacks on London to the final attacks on Honshu. Yet precision bombing, and the technical means to achieve it, was finally developed during the 44% Germany Ju 88 A-4 4,420 21,737 1,696 He 111 H-16 5,512 19,136 1,280 He 177 A-5 13,230 (d) 37,038 3,417 (d
