The heavy bombers could not protect themselves sufficiently in daylight raids. By the end of 1943 the search for a long-range fighter was completed and the final technical barrier to carrying on an offensive was removed. The escort fighters were designed both to protect the bomb cargoes before reaching the target and to engage and bombing. In Britain bomb research concentrated on large or special-purpose bombs for specific targets, such as the U-boat pens in the attacks in 1943 and 1944. It was only the growing evidence of how effective fire-bombs were, which came about with the switch to area bombing, that encouraged the RAF to place greater emphasis on them. The large high-explosive bombs were better suited for precision attacks, particularly for the interdiction of communications. For the attacks on cities new incendiary techniques were developed, including the use of high explosive bombs to seal off a section of a city into which the fire-bombs were to be aimed, and such techniques enormously increased the destructive power of the conventional bomb attack. The firestorms in Germany and Japan The same belief encouraged LeMay to move to area bombing of Japan because of the special difficulties in bomb-aiming through difficult weather conditions from a great height. The bombing of area targets was the main tactic used from the Luftwaffe attacks on London to the final attacks on Honshu. Yet precision bombing, and the technical means to achieve it, was finally developed during the war to such a degree that it was possible to carry out remarkable operations in the int
