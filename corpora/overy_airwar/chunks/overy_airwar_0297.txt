By the end of 1943 the search for a long-range fighter was bombing.*®! In Britain bomb research concentrated on large or special-purpose bombs for specific targets, such as the U-boat pens in the attacks in 1943 and 1944. It was only the growing evidence had the same impact on life and property as the atomic attacks in 1945.462 war to such a degree that it was possible to carry out remarkable operations in the interdiction of crucial communications in the preparations and support for ‘Overlord’.463 Navigational aids were (iii) The Strategic Argument  The restrictions imposed on bombing for most of the war through technical immaturity and inadequate intelligence led in turn to further problems. The criticisms of bombing from politicians and soldiers became more widespread as the gulf between the exaggerated claims of the air forces and the reality of bomber operations became more obvious. In Britain the political climate that had been so favourable to bombing in 1940 became more cautious. Churchill himself on learning of the conclusions of the Butt report wrote, ‘the most we can say is that [bombing] will be a heavy and I trust seriously increasing annoyance’.4® To Portal and Cherwell’s highly technical defence of the bombing strategy, for which Churchill himself had largely been responsible, Churchill replied ‘Everything is being done to create the bombing force desired on the largest possible scale, and there is no intention of changing this policy. I deprecate however placing unbounded confidence in this means of attack...’.466 To Cherwell, whose scientific advice had encouraged Churchill to advocate bombing in the first place, he wrote: ‘It is very disputable whether bombing by itself will be a decisive factor in the present war’.467 From 1941 onwards, although the War Cabinet never abandoned the bombing strategy, its proponent
