though for rather different reasons. For those, particularly on the British left, who favoured the maximum assistance to Stalin in 1942 and 1943, the bombing policy was regarded, as it was by the Russians, as a poor alternative. Moral objections to bombing on the other hand, though ever-present, had much less political impact than objections on military or political grounds.4”2  Within the military sphere criticism of bombing was more active and imposed on the bombing offensives certain limitations. This was particularly the case in the United States where, although the political support for bombing changed little, the Chief of Staff and the Joint Chiefs remained emphatic that the central strategy of the war was the future conquest by armies of mainland Europe and the Japanese islands. The main criticism of bombing was that it diverted resources from these other purposes and for little strategic advantage.  In Britain in particular, whose economic resources were stretched much more than those of the United States, the decision to devote a significant share of manpower and material to the bombing offensive aroused the hostility of those commanders starved of sufficient air forces for other operations. Brooke fought a long battle with the Air Ministry over the allocation of aircraft to army co- operation and arrived at the conclusion that ‘the Air Ministry outlook is so far divorced from the requirements of the Army that I see no solution to the problem except an Army Air Arm...’.471 Although sympathetic to the army position, the Combined Chiefs of Staff were no longer in a position by 1942 to reverse the bombing policy and could not have done so without an even more severe dislocation of the aircraft industry and loss of production. The problem over co-operation between the other services and the air forces lay in the fact that the initial strategic decision to bomb had been taken at a time when the expectations from bombing were high.
