The frequent calls for heavy bombers in the Middle East and India were as frequently ignored.473 All the discussions about the effectiveness of bombing had stressed that the objectives could only be achieved if such dispersion were avoided. The American AWPD-1 plan emphasized the need for ‘tenaciously concentrating all bombing toward the destruction of [the chosen] objectives’.474 The fact that concentration was not achieved, combined with the technical restrictions, imposed severe limits on what the bombing offensives could achieve at the time of their probation.  The main arguments surrounding bombing came to be concentrated in the end around the whole question of the best strategy for defeating Hitler. It was perhaps unfortunate for the bombing forces that the decision to prepare for invasion coincided with the beginning of the Combined Bombing Offensive itself. The armies had arrived in 1943 at the point where it was now possible to invade continental Europe, only to discover that the bombing offensive promised from three years before had not even seriously begun.
