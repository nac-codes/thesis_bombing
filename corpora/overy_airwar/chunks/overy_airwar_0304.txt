ined with bombardment from Britain, would bring Germany to surrender without invasion.475 The American Joint Chiefs not only rejected any question of an independent bombing attack but intended that the bombing of Japan should be carried out when suitable bases had been secured, because the chances of success were much greater and the risks involved in actual surface invasion too severe to reproduce the European strategy.476 But even in the Pacific preparations were made for an eventual invasion for which bombing had prepared the way in case bombing did not prove as successful as expected. After the experience of heavy bombing in Europe it was the latter course that the American planners finally accepted, until it became clearer that bombing had indeed been more successful in the more vulnerable and less well-defended Japanese theatre. In Europe on the other hand, the army expressed doubts about the bombers’ ability to mount even tactical bombing of sufficient strength to defeat the Luftwaffe and make invasion possible, and as a result issued directives through the Combined Chiefs to the bomber forces to concentrate on German fighter strength and transportation at the expense of all the other primary objectives.4?77 Eisenhower had clearly intended that American bombers be prepared for this role from the start. He told Churchill in 1943 that precision daylight bombing was to be retained so as ‘to have available the great force that would be needed to carry out the preparatory work in the areas selected for invasion’.478 The Combined Chiefs echoed this intention by directing that ‘all possible support must be afforded to the Allied Armies by our Air Forces to assist them in establishing themselves in the lodgement area...’.47° Although more opportunity arose after D-Day for taking up the attack against the primary objectives again it was clear that any end to the war would be a consequence of army operations assisted by the bombers rather than the other way around.
