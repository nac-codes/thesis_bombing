tain extent the mistake was not altogether surprising since most of the early bomb attacks failed to hit an obvious military target even when intended. The randomness of inaccurate area bombing certainly suggested attacks directed at morale rather than the economy. Yet because of the perception of bombing as a terror weapon, Hitler failed to provide adequate preparations for air defence of the economy when the full attack was launched. Arguing, just as the British had done in 1940, that German morale could not crack because of the nature of the German racial personality, he concluded that ‘the devastation actually works in our favour, because it is creating a body of people with nothing to lose — people who will therefore fight on with utter fanaticism’.482 The only concern over morale was the effect on the prestige of the Nazi regime as it became apparent that no effective protection against bombing had been prepared. Thinking back to the 1930s when bombing had been used as a diplomatic terror weavon. Hitler Page 128 of 309 46% precision daylight bombing was to be retained so as ‘to have available the great force that would be needed to carry out the preparatory work in the areas selected for invasion’.4”8 The Combined Chiefs about the impact bombing might have or the American intention in using it. Hence the stress on building a defence perimeter sufficiently far from the Japanese mainland to prevent bombing.48° In regime as it became apparent that no effective protection against bombing had been prepared. Thinking back to the 1930s when bombing had been used as a diplomatic terror weapon, Hitler determined to mount a counter-offensive against British bombing to try to produce a situation of stalemate in which neither side would lightly risk more terror-bombing for fear of retaliation. The renewed German strategic bombing offensive was hastily planned and prepared in the early stages of the attack on Russia in the east, and as such suffered from the persistent ina
