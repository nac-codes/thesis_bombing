ar of retaliation. The renewed German strategic bombing offensive was hastily planned and prepared in the early stages of the attack on Russia in the east, and as such suffered from the persistent inability to transfer sufficient resources from that attack to the bomb attack on Britain. The response to the British threat was nevertheless real enough. An air command was activated with orders to attack British cities, and although starved of resources, carried out a series of raids in 1942 and the winter of 1943-44. The first raids were relatively ineffective largely due to Hitler’s insistence on attacking small cultural centres in so-called ‘Baedeker raids’ as retaliation for attacks on Liibeck and Rostock.4®3 Little or no preparation went into attacks on the economy or vital military targets. The second period of bombing suffered from the fact that neither Hitler nor Goering understood the need for large numbers and bombloads, a fact that the poor early efforts of Bomber Command should have confirmed. Goering talked optimistically of the effects to be expected from attacks on London in 1943 with 150 aircraft, forgetting that the largest attack against London had been made in 1941 with over 600 medium bombers.4* In the end no significant attack could be mounted through a shortage of trained pilots and the necessary aircraft and the considerable improvement of the British night defences. The attempt to persuade Hitler to mount an economic offensive like that carried out in the Blitz ended in failure. Raeder told Hitler in February 1941 that ‘the Air Force must attempt to hit Great Britain where it hurts most, by attacking her imports’ and although Hitler did not disagree with the naval view he did not give the attacks high priority or compel the Luftwaffe to divert resources to helping the war at sea.485 In 1943 Speer tried once again to demonstrate to Hitler that bombing of economic targets was the best strategy, establishing one committee to examine the Russian econ
