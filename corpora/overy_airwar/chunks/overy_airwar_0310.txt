The most costly but without success.  The main reason why German plans came to little lay with the difficulty of producing sufficient aircraft after the production crisis of 1941. When production began to be increased priority went to fighter and fighter-bomber aircraft for the Russian front. The proportion of bombers produced fell, and as the initiative slipped away from the Luftwaffe so the imbalance between bomber and other aircraft produced increased, just at the time that Allied bomber production was multiplying, as the following table shows:  Table 10: Bomber Production and Bomb Tonnages Delivered48° 1940-45 Germany Britain and America (b)  Bomb Tonnage (a) Bomb Tonnage on  Bombers on U.K. Bombers Europe 2,852 36,844 3,529 14,631 3.373 21,858 4,668 35,509  about the impact bombing might have or the American intention in using it. Hence the stress on building a defence perimeter sufficiently far from the Japanese mainland to prevent bombing.42° In Command’s first sorties, allayed German fears that a sustained bombing campaign could be carried out.
