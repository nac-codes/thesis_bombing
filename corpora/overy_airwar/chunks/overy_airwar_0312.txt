As late as January 1945 he instructed Speer to produce ‘a high-speed heavy bomber with wide range and large bombload’ and insisted on retaining the Arado 234C jet bomber in production plans though only a few were produced for combat.48? The final counter-offensive was launched in 1944 with the V- weapons which Hitler deluded himself into believing could devastate London and bring ‘such a storm of protest and war-weariness that the Government will be overthrown’.488 Yet in 1944 nota quarter of the tonnage dropped in 1940 could be delivered. Hitler’s strategic intention — the search for a terror bombing weapon — ran far ahead of the ability of the German economy to supply the right weapons in the right numbers.  As the enemy bombing offensive increased in scale so Hitler was forced to rely more on static and passive defences instead of a bombing counter-offensive. Both Hitler and Goering believed anti- aircraft fire to be a more effective defence than aircraft. Combined with satisfactory passive defence preparation Hitler insisted on using anti-aircraft fire in preference to diverting large numbers  AL ate Lb Lene AL Neen Lenk A te en te a at ee eet Te Lt Le oe Oe A Le Le nee ent TL 0 et ate ee ee a LE TT ae ne oe Me een dd Co te  Page 130 of 309 47% Table 10: Bomber Production and Bomb Tonnages Delivered48* 1940-45  of aircraft from the Russian front or to increasing aircraft production. In this he was influenced by his own prejudices. The 88mm anti-aircraft gun was one which Hitler personally favoured for its versatility and performance. It was consistently given a high production priority as was the research associated with gun radar. When Hitler reached the final point of disillusionment with the air force in 1944 he instructed Speer to disband the Luftwaffe and produce a vast anti-aircraft army to protect German industry.482 As aconsequence of this it was difficult to persuade Hitler to accept active defence.
