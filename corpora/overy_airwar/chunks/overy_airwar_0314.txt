the threat of a total loss of fuel production, Hitler  agreed to divert a force of 2,000 fighter aircraft to protect vital fuel installations and industries, but during September and October the strength of the daylight fighter forces in Germany fell to only 200 and the promised new Reich air fleet was diverted to other tasks.423  The consequences of the failure to develop satisfactory air defences were profound. Allied bombing of economic targets was much more successful than the earlier experiences of bombing against good defences had suggested. The political consequences, although never approaching the collapse of war-willingness that Allied air commanders sought, nevertheless contributed to the self- inflicted elements in the decline of the Luftwaffe. Bombing finally destroyed Hitler’s confidence in his air forces, encouraging him to assume more of the operational control himself and to turn the Luftwaffe even more towards a tactical support role in the east. Goering failed to recover political favour even though Hitler hesitated to expose publicly Goering’s responsibility for the failure of the air defences.4%4 The effect of the bombing on public opinion encouraged Goebbels and the Gauleiter to work against Goering, yet further undermining the authority and credibility of the air force commander and damaging morale amongst the air staffs.495 By 1944 the difficulty in getting a large air strength established for fresh strategic tasks was exaggerated by the hostility with which the other services and the Nazi party regarded the air force.
