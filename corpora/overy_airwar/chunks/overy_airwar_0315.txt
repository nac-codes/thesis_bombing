Of much greater significance was the effect of bombing on the German economy. The actual amount of physical destruction was far less than the Allies expected, until the middle of 1944 when the increased weight of bombs dropped and the increasing precision of attacks made destruction more likely. Factory plant was effectively repaired quickly or dispersed among smaller producers and the attack on morale, although reducing labour efficiency, did not seriously weaken industrial performance because of the regular recruitment of foreign labour and the capital-intensive nature of much German industry.426 The success of the attack on oil was due to the fact that for the first time a large amount of physical destruction was concentrated on a highly capital-intensive industry with few opportunities for effective dispersal.42? The same was true of attacks on steel production. The indiscriminate attacks of Bomber Command, although interrupting the smooth operation of the economy over a period of time, failed to effect enough destruction of capital stock that was difficult to replace. Attacks against the aircraft industry, on the other hand, which were begun by both Allied forces in early 1944 were effective in part because of the damage done to special machine tools of which there was a permanent shortage in specialized large-scale aircraft manufacture.4°8 In addition to physical  Page 131 of 309 47% TILUICL LISELL LEVEL AUALUUTIEM LE SE ALEIL LOL dh SULLADIS VULILUEL AIIM TOOLS LOU LIE Plalio LU LILLE ASE LEI
