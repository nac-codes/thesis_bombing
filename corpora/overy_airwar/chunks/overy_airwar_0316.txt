The indiscriminate attacks of Bomber Command, although interrupting the smooth operation of the economy early 1944 were effective in part because of the damage done to special machine tools of which there was a permanent shortage in specialized large-scale aircraft manufacture.498 In addition to physical destruction, the German economy suffered a physical dislocation in the effort devoted to coping with the bombing. A greater diversion of German resources arose through defence against bomb attack war material was produced specifically for defence against bombing. Speer estimated that 30 per cent of total gun output and 20 per cent of heavy ammunition in 1944 was intended for anti-aircraft defences. Some 50 per cent of electro-technical production and 33 per cent of the optical industry was devoted to radar and signals equipment for anti-aircraft installations, starving the front of essential communications resources. In addition material had to be diverted from new capital investment to satisfy the demands for repairs to damaged factories and communications.42° Similar resources were tied down in Britain and
