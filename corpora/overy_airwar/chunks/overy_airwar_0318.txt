forts were already at the planning stage well before bombing became an economic threat or was perceived as such.  resources, was capable of producing after 1943. After that date Hitler and the economic administration were determined to expand output to the limit. In aircraft production, for example, plans were laid in 1944 for an annual rate of production of 80,000 aircraft a year in 1945.592 Vast new factories were under construction for the mass-production of aero-engines and aircraft.5° In fact in 1944 Germany’s aircraft production reached a peak of only 36,000; Japan, with a much smaller and less advanced industrial base had been able to produce 28,000 aircraft in the same year. The impact of even this increase was heavily reduced by the destruction of assembled aircraft at the factories, and the loss of fuel and spare parts for those aircraft that eventually reached the front-line units. The large new factories were bombed and in most cases abandoned.*% Substantial though as increases in German output appeared, they might have been greater still but for bombing. There were, to be sure, other constraints on production, particularly power and certain raw materials.5° Indeed Hitler’s own strategy of a low level of economic mobilization in the early years of war contributed much to the later difficulties in increasing production. But even had these restrictions not been overcome, the absence of bombing would have freed resources held down in anti-aircraft and repair work; would have eliminated wastage caused by bombing; and would have allowed the industrial planners the same freedom as that enjoyed in the United States to plan, build and operate the war economy without interruption and as near to the economic optimum as possible.  It was this freedom to plan war production without interruption and hence to achieve a smooth flow of war supplies that was destroyed by bombing. Instead, bombing increasingly dictated to the German authorities how the economy was to be o
