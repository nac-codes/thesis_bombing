tion without interruption and hence to achieve a smooth flow of war supplies that was destroyed by bombing. Instead, bombing increasingly dictated to the German authorities how the economy was to be organized. Once bombing began German industry was forced to adopt a more improvised and flexible approach to production planning. To some extent improvisation was successful in preventing a greater toll of current production being exacted by the bombers, but in the nature of improvisation severe limitations were placed on the long- encouraged Goebbels and the Gauleiter to work against Goering, yet further undermining the authority and commander and damaging morale amongst the air staffs.42> By 1944 the difficulty in getting a large air strength established for fresh strategic tasks was exaggerated by the hostility with which the German economy far from declining from an earlier peak due to the increased bombing effort was in fact expanding at a faster rate than before.5°° The strategic decisions for such expansion did not inadequate production was for current needs.52! As the war in Russia widened so the demands for new material escalated well beyond what Hitler had initially expected. It was not bombing that But bombing was much more effective than the Allies bi int c 1g fe ly great L s. Bombing placed a ceiling on German war production which was well below what Germany, with skilful and more urgent management of its laid in 1944 for an annual rate of production of 80,000 aircraft a year in 1945.5 Vast new factories were under construction for the mass-production of aero-engines and aircraft.5®3 In fact in 1944 large new factories were bombed and in most cases abandoned.5% Substantial though as increases in German output appeared, they might have been greater still but for bombing. There were, to be sure, other constraints on production, particularly power and certain raw materials.5% Indeed Hitler’s own strategy of a low level of economic mobilization in the early year
