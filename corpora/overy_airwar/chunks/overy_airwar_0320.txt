bombing. There were, to be sure, other constraints on production, particularly power and certain raw materials.5% Indeed Hitler’s own strategy of a low level of economic mobilization in the early years of war contributed much term development of the war economy. The decision to move factories into disused mines and caves or to hide them in forest clearings, while allowing some production to continue right until the end of the war was not the basis for any large-scale increase in mass-produced war material.506 The very fact of dispersal itself produced a number of constraints. Design bureaux found themselves located miles away from the factories with which they were associated. Factory size was severely restricted by the need to break up large and easily visible buildings into smaller units. Yet in the aircraft and tank industries the tendency before bombing began was to operate larger and larger units in order to win all the necessary production economies. These economies were lost in many cases with dispersal forced by bombing.*°” So, too, were the gains made by the rationalization of war industry undertaken in the middle of the war by Speer and the Industrial Councils. Many more machine tools had to be distributed to the smaller dispersed plants, and because each unit was smaller than the large factory complex that had been dispersed, work with special machine tools for mass-production had to be abandoned in favour of using general purpose tools again, which often required a considerable amount of hand-work.5°8 The dispersal also put a heavier demand on skilled labour which could be diluted in the larger units, in which semi-skilled workers operated the new  Page 133 of 309 47% early 1944 were effective in part because of the damage done to special machine tools of which there was a permanent shortage in specialized large-scale aircraft manufacture.428 In addition to physical e, This was more than the total employed in the whole of the aircraft industry.
