ich there was a permanent shortage in specialized large-scale aircraft manufacture.428 In addition to physical e, This was more than the total employed in the whole of the aircraft industry. A large quantity of per cent of total gun output and 20 per cent of heavy ammunition in 1944 was intended for anti-aircraft German economy far from declining from an earlier peak due to the increased bombing effort was in fact expanding at a faster rate than before.*° The strategic decisions for such expansion did not stem from the fact of bombing itself, but from the struggles on the eastern front. The plans to expand aircraft production stemmed from the middle of 1941 when it had already been shown how inadequate production was for current needs.52! As the war in Russia widened so the demands for new material escalated well beyond what Hitler had initially expected. It was not bombing that spurred on the German economy to greater efforts, for those efforts were already at the planning stage well before bombing! became an economic threat or was Perceived as such. 1g ly Ss. fombing placed a ceiling on German war production which was well below what Germany, with skilful and more ~ungent management of its laid in 1944 for an annual rate of production of 80,000 aircraft a year in 1945.502 Vast new factories were under construction for the mass-production of aero-engines and aircraft.53 In fact in 1944 sure, other constraints on production, particularly power and certain raw materials.5°5 Indeed Hitler’s own strategy of a low level of economic mobilization in the early years of war contributed much of the war was not the basis for any large-scale increase in mass-produced war material.50° required a considerable amount of hand-work.*°8 The dispersal also put a heavier demand on skilled labour which could be diluted in the larger units, in which semi-skilled workers operated the new machinery under supervision, but which was needed again when factories were dispersed because of the
