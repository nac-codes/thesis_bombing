labour which could be diluted in the larger units, in which semi-skilled workers operated the new machinery under supervision, but which was needed again when factories were dispersed because of the renewed emphasis on skilled workmanship rather than machine-production.°92 Moreover dispersal made it more likely that casual interruption to the flow of parts and materials due to the bombing of communications would be increased. Many factories were left with finished aircraft or engines that were missing a few crucial parts, either held up in transit or bombed in the area attacks. The more elaborate the dispersal became, the more acute the problems of supply. This was even more the case when during the course of 1943 the Air Ministry agreed to the dispersal of production into occupied Europe. The European aircraft industry had until then been relatively little used by the Germans. Factories had been dismantled in Yugoslavia, Poland and Russia and the machinery sent back to the Reich. In France and Czechoslovakia some limited production of parts and inessential aircraft had been undertaken since the occupation began. Goering’s decision to reverse the original policy of not utilizing foreign industry was an answer not only to the failure of aircraft production within Germany, but to the threat of more bombing.5!° However the new dispersal outside the Reich brought many of the same problems. The German aircraft industry had used the French facilities for carrying on research which was proscribed in Germany itself because it was not immediately related to war needs. The new instructions forced the firms to turn these facilities over to full: aircraft production. The lack of tools and skilled labour, much of which had been taken off i into the Reich, meant thats resources had to be sent out of Germany to meet the new requirements.
