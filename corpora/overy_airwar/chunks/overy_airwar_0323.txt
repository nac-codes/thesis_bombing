There were, to be of the war was not the basis for any large-scale increase in mass-produced war material.5°° machinery under supervision, but which was needed again when factories were dispersed because of the renewed emphasis on skilled workmanship rather than machine-production.592 Moreover of aircraft production within Germany, but to the threat of more bombing.*!° However the new dispersal outside the Reich brought many of the same problems. The German aircraft industry had used over to full aircraft production. The lack of tools and skilled labour, much of which had been taken off into the Reich, meant that resources had to be sent out of Germany to meet the new requirements. Moreover the Allies had already begun to bomb French factories as well.511 The resulting confusion reduced the Luftwaffe’s production in France to a total of only 2,500, mostly trainer aircraft, for the whole war period. The same situation prevailed in central Europe. Resources had to be taken out of the Reich and distributed among a large number of Czech and Hungarian enterprises while the Air Ministry made great efforts to complete the construction of large factories to replace the dispersed workshops in comparatively bomb-safe areas.*!2 The aircraft production capacity of the conquered areas was approximately 14,000 aircraft per year before occupation. Had the German administration been able to utilize this capacity fully during 1943 and 1944 the production of armaments would have been significantly greater. But at just the point when Germany was
