n. Had the German administration been able to utilize this capacity fully during 1943 and 1944 the production of armaments would have been significantly greater. But at just the point when Germany was poised to plan and produce large increases in output over and above those already planned, bombing reduced the possibility and left instead a desperate improvisation. Such increases would still have been subject to raw material limitations, but the amount of war material that Germany might have been able to produce for the crucial battles of 1944 and 1945 without bombing would have meant a longer and far more costly battle for the final defeat of fascism, and might have made necessary the use of atomic weapons in Europe as well.513  In Japan bombing was far more successful in terms of direct destruction. Not only were Japanese defences weak and poorly organized, no attempt was made to meet the American threat with a counter-offensive. The standard bombers lacked range or carrying capacity and the proposed trans-oceanic bomber, the Fugako, was judged to be too demanding on limited production resources and suffered the same fate as the bombers proposed in Germany for attacking the United States.5!4 The fire-bombing campaign that began in March 1945 despite Stimson’s moral qualms and Roosevelt’s delusion that the air forces were ‘blowing to bits carefully selected targets’,515 reduced Japan’s already shrinking war capability dramatically. By July 1945 Japanese production was 35 per cent of its wartime peak, where in the case of Germany it was conservatively calculated that only 10 per cent of planned current production was lost through bombing in 1944.516 The effect on morale, while not sufficient to lead to the overthrow of the regime, reduced the ability or willingness to work. The evacuation into the countryside served only to confuse still further the running of the economy, which relied increasingly on production in home workshops and in those few towns not yet bombe
