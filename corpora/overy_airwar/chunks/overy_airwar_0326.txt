When the final decision was made by the Emperor for surrender it was in the knowledge that the peace party in the Cabinet had predicted an end to the war through bombing in September, a month earlier than the date given by LeMay to Arnold.5!8 Indeed the difference between the atomic bomb and a conventional B-29 attack was largely academic in the case of Japan where the cities were ideally suited to area fire-bombing, which produced largely the same effects. The use of the atomic bomb, whatever the wider diplomatic and strategic purposes in using it, represented the culmination of a bombing policy begun by Britain and Germany five years before.512 The object of bombing was in the end to bring as large an amount of destruction as cheaply as possible to the enemy homeland, indiscriminately against military and civilian targets.
