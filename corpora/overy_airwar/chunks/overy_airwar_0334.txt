ficers whom he regarded as conservative and convention-bound.526 The result was that since Hitler was the final source of all authority in a thorough, almost literal, sense any question with regard to the use of the air forces had to be decided by Hitler. By the end of war this had reached the level where Hitler himself personally ordered the day-to-day operations of air units on the eastern front, by-passing the commander-in- chief, the air staff and the front commanders.52? But this had not always been the case. In the early years of the build-up of the Luftwaffe and in the early years of war, Hitler relied heavily on Goering, whose main claim to authority derived not from a military career but from his political role in the party and the state. Being a political creature, Goering used his position in the Luftwaffe as a means to increase political influence at the expense of other leaders, and being in Hitler’s confidence he was able to insist on the autonomy of his air force. Such autonomy cut off the Luftwaffe from regular top-level co-operation with the other services, or with the supreme command, and during the war cut off the Luftwaffe from the rest of the war economy. The ‘leadership principle’ thus encouraged a lack of liaison between rival hierarchies, and led instead to duplication of effort and bureaucratization as Goering attempted to establish an independent administrative and economic base. The isolationism of the air force produced a growing communications gap between Hitler and the air force. There were no regular meetings with the air commander-in-chief, and those that there were became less frequent as the war progressed. The supreme headquarters had Luftwaffe liaison officers of low rank and little authority.528 Hitler’s personal preference for the informal gathering of information from front-line pilots and favoured members of his entourage distorted yet further the kind of information that passed from the air force to the political leadership.5
