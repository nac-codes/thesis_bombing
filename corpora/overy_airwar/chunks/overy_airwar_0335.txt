nformal gathering of information from front-line pilots and favoured members of his entourage distorted yet further the kind of information that passed from the air force to the political leadership.522 Such distortion was compounded by the way in which Goering deliberately misrepresented the strength or ability of the air force in order to retain Hitler’s indulgence and boost his own political fortunes. Even when the exaggerated claims of the Luftwaffe commander had been exposed in the declining air effectiveness of 1941 and 1942 Hitler retained a naive faith in the ability of the air force to redress the strategic balance, a faith based on ignorance of air force affairs coupled with respect for Goering’s political position.522  Had Goering been a successful air leader the lack of communication with the rest of the military and political leadership might have been offset. However, like Hitler, Goering lacked any real professional claim to high military office.
