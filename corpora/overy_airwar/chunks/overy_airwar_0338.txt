In between bouts of uncontrollable abuse at the air forces, culminating in an excited telephone call to the chief-of-staff that ‘the entire Luftwaffe command should be hanged immediately’, Hitler ignored the air force, preferring to complete the struggle with the army.535 To Hitler’s constant complaints about the air force Goebbels responded in his diary that ‘it is no good the Fiihrer saying today that he had wanted the right thing but had not insisted on it.’226 Relying too heavily on political allies as military commanders, ill-informed about air affairs and yet anxious to retain ultimate control over the strategy that contained them, dismissive of the professional airman in favour of occasional and unorthodox insights, fascist leadership contrasted sharply with the administration and leadership against which it was fighting. The lack of proper strategic direction distorted the effect of deficiencies elsewhere in training and preparation, which under different circumstances might well have been mastered, as were many of the deficiencies of the enemy.
