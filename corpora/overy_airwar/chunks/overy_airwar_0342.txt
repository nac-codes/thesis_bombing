air force Goebbels responded in his diary that ‘it is no good the Fiihrer saying doctrine and independence.*37 through ‘subordination of air power to the supreme command of the armed forces’ and that a different situation would compromise the principle of unity of command.*° In private he ascribed air force demands for independence less charitably to the fact that the older but low-ranking air officers were looking for opportunities for promotion by giving the air force a separate status.541 Marshall was persuaded to accept change, however, because of the obvious inefficiency of the prevailing system.

This was not achieved until 1947 when it had become clear beyond all doubt that the strategic tasks of the air force differed in kind from those of the army. What the limited autonomy did bring was a unity of command over air forces, regular consultation with the air force commander in the highest political and military circles, and the creation of a separate air staff.
