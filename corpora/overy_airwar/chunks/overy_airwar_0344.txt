be as free as possible from the intervention of the traditional army whose staff Hitler derided as an ‘exclusive clique of particularly arrogant dunces and national pests’.*45 The German army had indeed objected to the creation of a separate force, and had in 1933 attempted to forestall Hitler by establishing an army-controlled air bureau.54¢ But in fact the independence of the Luftwaffe was a political rather than a doctrinal one. As far as the function of the air force was concerned it remained closely tied to the needs of the army, and was subject to the directives of the army-dominated supreme headquarters. After the failure of air force operations over England in 1940 the integration of the air force with the army became closer, reaffirming the preference for limited air power of both Hitler and the army staff. Goering’s lack of firm control over the air force, and his growing isolation and indolence, allowed the army to assume considerable operational control as well. The effect was to stifle later Luftwaffe efforts to embark on strategic tasks of its own, and to confirm Hitler’s own preference for air forces that played a narrowly defined role at the battlefront. Japan alone of all the major air powers pursued a different line. The army and navy had established bureaux for air affairs in 1919 and 1916 respectively, and from those dates onwards retained control over their own individual air forces. Because of the tradition of the Japanese navy and the geographic need for a large naval force, the navy’s air arm was the larger and more important of the two. Both army and navy air forces were represented at Army and Navy Headquarters by commanding officers of the Army Air and Navy Air HQ, but at the Imperial General Headquarters the interests of the air were served by the army and navy chiefs of staff. The army air corps was given an equal status with the other army branches, but in the navy the air forces were assigned subordinately to the individual fleets, or
