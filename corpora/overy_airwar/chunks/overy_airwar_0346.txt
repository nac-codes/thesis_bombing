f the two air services. The meagre radar network was further weakened by the fact that in 19 of the 30 radar sites the navy and army air forces had their own separate stations side by side, duplicating information. Other air forces were not immune from internal rivalry, but only in Japan did such rivalry seriously affect the performance in the air war.548 There were other sources of conflict, too. Rivalry between the air forces and the other services took a variety of forms. At root much of the rivalry was fanned by the fear that an independent air force hoped to supplant the older services by the use of strategies that rendered armies and navies redundant. For example, although there were sound strategic arguments for an invasion of continental Europe in 1943, the plans were defended with such force because they promised a major role to armies and navies and a subordinate role to the air forces. The air force alternative of a war of attrition from the air was attacked, not just on technical grounds, but because it deliberately challenged the army view of war. The more forcefully the armies insisted on ground operations, the easier it became for armies to insist on the creation of air forces that were primarily tactical in composition and operation. For Russia and Germany on the eastern front these questions did not arise for both sides were committed throughout to the primacy of tactical support. In the west the insistence after 1943 on the creation of large tactical air forces, although of great value in the final invasion, was seen by some air force leaders as an attempt to sabotage their efforts to achieve a decision through bombing alone and to confound those critics who revealed how exaggerated the initial claims for the impact of air warfare had been.*42 The fact that such claims had been made in the first place encouraged rivalry over other questions. The air forces took the largest slice of financial and economic resources even in Page 142 of 309 51% early
