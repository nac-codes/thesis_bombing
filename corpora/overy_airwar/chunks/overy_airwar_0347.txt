that such claims had been made in the first place encouraged rivalry over other questions. The air forces took the largest slice of financial and economic resources even in Page 142 of 309 51% early 1941, and the reorganization of hemisphere defence relied on the lessons drawn from these studies.*22 Marshall was less convinced, arguing until the end of 1941 that German success had come and had in 1933 attempted to forestall Hitler by establishing an army-controlled air bureau.*4¢ But in fact the independence of the Luftwaffe was a political rather than a doctrinal one. As far as the the individual fleets, or to the carrier fleet.547 This structure was little questioned. It produced, however, instead of a struggle for influence over air forces between the air force and the army, a rivalry information. Other air forces were not immune from internal rivalry, but only in Japan did such rivalry seriously affect the performance in the air war.*48 countries committed to a large land army. In many cases they took the best recruits. The loss of these resources to the other services gave scope to those who claimed that money could be better spent on something else. In Germany in 1939 the other services were able to get the air force budget substantially reduced, thus imposing an additional restriction on the pre-war period of expansion.5*° In Britain the programme of heavy bombers was restricted as the war progressed, because the original plans would have diverted even greater resources from urgent economic priorities for other services.55! When to this use of large resources was added the failure to use them as effectively as had been promised, the temptation was to curtail the air force in favour of other services, or, in the case of Germany, to try to abolish the air force altogether. On balance such rivalry was confined to occasional open conflict or personal hostility, puncturing relations between the services that were otherwise sensible and cordial, but air forces wer
