On balance such rivalry was confined to occasional open conflict or personal hostility, puncturing relations between the services that were otherwise sensible and cordial, but air forces were always in a position of having to justify their existence and their doctrines to a much greater extent than armies and navies.  The importance of such rivalry, and of the constitutional question in general, was the way in which this influenced the final use of air forces.

As far as the warfare had been.*4° The fact that such claims had been made in the first place encouraged rivalry over other questions. The air forces took the largest slice of financial and economic resources even in on something else. In Germany in 1939 the other services were able to get the air force budget substantially reduced, thus imposing an additional restriction on the pre-war period of expansion.552 In large-scale bombing offensives, and that other powers did not, was a reflection of the degree of independence enjoyed by the air forces. Where the relationship was primarily a subsidiary one the tactical use of aircraft predominated. In Britain and America the air staffs were correspondingly more powerful and more fully integrated into the policy-making process. Air officers held high rank in the General Staffs, and in the command
