n Britain and America the air staffs were correspondingly more powerful and more fully integrated into the policy-making process. Air officers held high rank in the General Staffs, and in the command of large-scale operations, not just because of their position in the air force but because they had more general command qualities. In Germany the senior air commanders were seldom in a position to command ground troops directly, or to trespass on the staff work at the supreme headquarters, and those like Kesselring who did were army officers who had temporarily adopted an air uniform. Army traditions were too strong to allow the air force a greater say in the overall running of the war, while Goering had instilled the Luftwaffe with a feeling of isolationism which discouraged it from claiming a more important role. The same was true in Japan and Russia, where air commanders, because of the specialization of their role, were confined largely to air operations and not brought more fully into the supreme military establishment. Such a distinction explained in part the greater emphasis placed upon air warfare in the west, and the failure in Germany and Japan to anticipate the decline in air power and take steps at the highest level to reverse it. ee the two air services. The meagre radar network was further weakened by the fact that i in 19 of the 30 radar sites the navy and army air ir forces had their own separate stations side by side, duplicating on something else. In Germany in 1939 the other services were able to get the air force budget substantially reduced, thus imposing an additional restriction on the pre-war period of expansion.**2 In (iii) The Air Force Officer Corps  The different status enjoyed by the air forces during the war was reflected in patterns of recruitment and the available numbers of senior air officers, particularly those of staff quality. Differences in the nature and establishment of the senior officer corps had considerable repercussions on t
