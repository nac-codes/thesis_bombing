ses career air officers already possessed a considerable amount of technical training. Where gaps existed during the war civilians were brought in to organize technical and engineering functions, and in the AAF in particular considerable emphasis was laid on the engineering staffs, on whose contribution the combat staffs were largely dependent.*5¢ The use of civilians also made it easier, particularly for the RAF, to co-operate with the economic and administrative departments responsible for supply, research and maintenance, all of which proved to be vital functions for the survival of a modern air force. Germany and Russia, like America, had to build up an air officer corps during the 1930s and lacked any effective continuity with the air forces of the First World War. From the period of the First Five-Year Plan the Russian air force expanded rapidly. Enjoying the status under the Chief of Staff enjoyed by the artillery and cavalry and subject to command from the ground, the Russian air force did not require a large number of senior officers for staff work. The air force was required to provide close support for ground troops which could be organized satisfactorily by officers with an army background, as it was in Japan.55? Even at the level of the supreme command army and civilian personnel assumed considerable direct control over air forces. Because of the limited use to which Soviet air forces were put at the front greater emphasis was laid on the technical side of air force administration. The officers responsible for maintenance, supply and production were given high status and were closely involved in economic and technical questions, and such a position was reflected in the success of Soviet aircraft production in contrast with the lack of initiative demonstrated at the front, although to some extent this was the result of Stalin’s personal intervention. His conservatism discouraged strategic experiment in air warfare.*58 In this respect the purges had less
