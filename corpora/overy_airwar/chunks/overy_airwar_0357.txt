The number of air officers who were Communists rose from 58,000 in 1941 to 123,000 in 1943.5°1 In Germany by contrast political loyalty was an avenue to during the 1920s for morphine addiction.5®2 Even Goering himself lacked any professional experience as a senior military figure, on account of which he preferred to surround himself with those the 1920s, including a number of cavalry officers who were less essential to the army needs in the 1930s.5®3 This fusion of officer personnel contributed to the army-mindedness of the air force, and encouraged the pursuit of a tactical air force closely co-operating with the army units. But it also had the unfortunate consequence of dividing the air officer corps into those who regarded themselves as heirs of the Prussian tradition, and those who came from an unorthodox, particularly technical, background. Part of the hostility felt between regular soldiers and the parvenus arose from the fact that newcomers were given high military office without having followed the normal army channels. Milch was recruited as a civilian and was given the rank of colonel in 1933, rising to field marshal in 1940, at the expense of others who had risen to high rank by the traditional route.5®4 Jeschonnek as chief of the air staff, and a regular army officer before 1933, led the conflict between the two sides.
