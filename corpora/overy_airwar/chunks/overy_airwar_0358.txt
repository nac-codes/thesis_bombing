mutual hostility and constitutional distinctness discouraged proper contacts between those who provided the aircraft and those who used them, a fact made explicit by - a or emphasis was laid on the engineering staffs, on whose contribution the combat staffs were largely dependent.*** The use of civilians also made it easier, particularly for the RAF, to co-operate with the background, as it was in Japan.*5? Even at the level of the supreme command army and civilian personnel assumed considerable direct control over air forces. Because of the limited use to which Soviet although to some extent this was the result of Stalin’s personal intervention. His conservatism discouraged strategic experiment in air warfare.558 In this respect the purges had less effect on the air political loyalty.55 During the period between 1937 and 1942 the turnover of senior air officers was not unlike the changes taking place in many air forces which were intent upon eradicating conservatism and incompetence (the RAF, for example, experienced some 17 major changes in senior command positions between 1938 and 1943).56° Most of those promoted during the war in Russia distinguished themselves in combat.

Firmly committed to the Prussian tradition he was, according to Milch, ‘contemptuous of other walks of life’5®* Such contempt took the unfortunate form of a deep distrust of the orders prohibiting engineering personnel from visiting front units
