e was, according to Milch, ‘contemptuous of other walks of life’5®* Such contempt took the unfortunate form of a deep distrust of the orders prohibiting engineering personnel from visiting front units.5®* Unlike all the other major air powers the German air force did not bring in civilians as advisers, or recruit extensively from other spheres during the war, to compensate for shortages in the service, insisting that the work of the Luftwaffe was more properly conducted by soldiers. This exclusiveness had the effect of diluting what staff officer material was available and left the Luftwaffe short of the necessary numbers to carry out the traditional and wide-ranging staff tasks. This was caused to some extent too by the policy of insisting that staff officers should have combat experience. Not only did this lead to a situation where almost a quarter of the staff officers during the war were killed, but it meant that little continuity could be maintained at staff level, while those units entrusted to staff officers on a tour of duty often had to devote valuable time to instructing the staff officers in carrying out combat duties.*®” In 1942 Hitler turned the policy on its head with even more disastrous consequences. He ordered that the Luftwaffe general staff vacancies should be filled only by those who had distinguished themselves in combat at the front. Not only did this then denude the front of the best commanders, it gave no guarantee that such officers, with no staff training, would be capable of the more challenging work behind the lines.*** The subsequent demoralization  Page 145 of 309 53% SLLNGELITIALLY PULLING LADLE UMC TILL LE LEIUL SE UPCLULY~ AEE LAL LILI OLOEL LAL ULLILEO, SELALLY UL WILLE VALLI LALLA YY RELIES AD WEL, LLU.
