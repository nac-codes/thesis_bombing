out the preliminary selection and training.5”© Similar pre-service experience was provided through Cadet Corps.5?2 The existence of an informal procurement area for air service both simplified the selection process and provided a large reserve of men with an active interest in, and experience of, air activity. This fact was perhaps more important from the point of view of acquiring suitable ground personnel than pilots, since pilots required long periods of intensive training for which non- professional preparation was less satisfactory.  During the war the supply of large numbers of skilled ground crew and engineers was an essential factor in keeping an air force in being. No air force was unaware of this necessity, but there were limits imposed on the amount of maintenance and engineering personnel available. Part of the problem lay in the fact that much of this skilled labour was required more urgently in the aircraft factories, and the air forces and economic ministries fought over how it should be divided. There were limits imposed as well by the general level of preparedness for air warfare, and the extent to which sufficient engineering resources were available in the economy. In America the shortage of engineering personnel had been the result of a law, approved in 1926, restricting the number of non- flying officers in the air force to 10 per cent.5”8 In Europe, too, little attention had been paid to the need to expand ground services rapidly and extensively in wartime, although there existed a pool of skilled engineer officers and mechanics who were used both to train the wartime recruits and to run the major service commands and air bases. One way in which the shortages were satisfied was the close involvement of the aircraft industry itself in the programme of salvage, repair and maintenance, so that the necessary skilled labour was not lost irretrievably to the industry.5”2 In Germany the manufacturers were compelled to provide the Luftwaffe with small
