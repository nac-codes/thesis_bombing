seven days’ fighting equipment which could be moved forward with the army to give rapid and flexible repair facilities. In 1943 the units worked on an average of 540 aircraft a day; by 1945 on 4,000 a day. In Britain the shortage of engineering and ground personnel prompted the central organization of maintenance which, under the impact of scientific Operational Research recommendations, developed ‘Planned Flying and Maintenance’ procedures designed to achieve ‘the last ounce of operational effort per maintenance man-hour out of the aircraft available’. In Germany and Japan no separate command for services was created, and although in the German case maintenance was efficiently operated at a local level, lack of overall supervision, lack of mobility and finally a lack of resources under the impact of bombing, led to deteriorating rates of serviceability.*8° Where the Allied forces enjoyed rates of serviceability in excess of 80 per cent in the invasion of Europe, German serviceability during the same period averaged only 65 per cent and during the war in the east in 1942 sank as low as 53 per cent. Japanese serviceability in the Pacific battles of 1944 and 1945 was between 50 and 60 per cent, although Allied estimates put the level at well below 50 per cent.58!  Differences in serviceability also reflected different levels of success in coping with labour shortages. In America and Britain some of the shortages in ground personnel were met by mobilizing women for air base work, and in America women were supplemented by recruiting civilian unskilled and disabled labour for work at air depots, a total of 137,000 between January 1942 and December 1944.582 In Russia, too, much of the work was undertaken by women. Only in Germany and Japan were women not extensively mobilized for this kind of war work. As the war progressed the failure to mobilize sufficient personnel for air services, coupled with the lack of emphasis placed on the service sector by creating large and c
