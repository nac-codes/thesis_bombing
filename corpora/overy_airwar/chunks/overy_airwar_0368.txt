As the war progressed the failure to mobilize sufficient personnel for air services, coupled with the lack of emphasis placed on the service sector by creating large and co-equal service commands, reduced the efficiency of the Axis air forces. In Germany this was not a fundamental weakness, and the mobilization of skilled engineering recruits continued to the end of the war, even if under increasingly difficult conditions. Shortages of adequately qualified pilots proved much more damaging. In Japan, on the other hand, there existed severe shortages of technically trained forces for the air services.

In the spring of 1945 some 50,000 trainees were removed from flying training and forced to take up ground service work for which they were not well-
