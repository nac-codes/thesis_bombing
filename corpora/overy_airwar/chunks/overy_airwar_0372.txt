the early stages of the war from the high standard of training. In the Japanese case the capture of the entire southern region brought only the lightest casualties in the air, which confirmed the air leaders in the wisdom of relying on quality rather than quantity. The danger of such reliance lay in the fact that it was very much harder to replace an over-trained pilot. Against greater numbers and better aircraft excellent training remained a limited form of defence and dependence on the ‘invincibility of a refined technique’ blinded the air force to the need for large numbers of aircraft, and competent rather than outstanding pilots.  The second question all air forces had to answer concerned numbers. There was no doubt that training had to be expanded on the outbreak of war, and all the major powers except Japan rapidly increased the number of training schools and the levels of pilot recruitment.5%° As pilots took anything up to three years for thorough training in peace-time, it was important to make the right guesses as to the possible course of the war and the requirements for pilots in the future. A number of factors governed how such guesses were made. The first was the availability of aircraft. Where aircraft plans were modest either through strategic intention, as in Germany, or through economic limitation, as in Japan, the number of trained pilots required was correspondingly lower. In Britain and America, where the initial estimates of aircraft needs were high and were based on a long war hypothesis, the number of pilots planned was very much greater. In Germany and Japan lower estimates of pilot needs were based to some extent on combat experience, for losses in the early months of the European and Far Eastern wars were comparatively light. The Polish campaign, for example, cost the Luftwaffe 400 aircrew of whom about half were pilots.5*! As a result of an underestimation of pilot losses the German, and later the Japanese air forces undertook a major ex
