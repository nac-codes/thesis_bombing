The fighter pilots compared themselves to the traditional kendo of Japan and demanded aircraft that would display to accept.586 Japanese pilots were brought to believe that a ‘spiritual conviction in victory would balance any scientific advantage’.58” The strictest individual discipline was maintained over the air Japanese pilots trained for the elite Combined Fleet carrier force all had over 800 hours’ flying experience, some three to four times the amount of flying time in other air forces.582 Both the German increased the number of training schools and the levels of pilot recruitment.5% As pilots took anything up to three years for thorough training in peace-time, it was important to make the right example, cost the Luftwaffe 400 aircrew of whom about half were pilots.5%! As a result of an underestimation of pilot losses the German, and later the Japanese air forces undertook a major expansion of numbers only under the full impact of war, at considerable cost in training standards. A related problem lay in the kind of war that was expected. Hoping for short wars the Axis powers lacked urgency in training personnel for the prospect of a long-term conflict, hoping that the higher levels achieved before the war would provide a satisfactory reserve. Britain, by contrast, lacking trained flying personnel in 1939, and anxious about the effect this would have on air force performance, geared the expansion schemes to the prospect of along and
