Operational aircraft were diverted to the training schools, despite complaints from the front, in order to give all crews advanced training on the aircraft they would later be flying in combat. This made good a particular deficiency in British training at the outbreak of war. So too did the development of a corps of instructors, who were constantly replenished from those with some combat experience, and whose retention in a training capacity was again defended at the highest political level as a fact essential to the future waging of successful air warfare.525 Page 151 of 309 55% Britain, by contrast, lacking trained flying personnel in 1939, and anxious about the effect this would have on air force performance, geared the expansion schemes to the prospect of a long and escalating conflict. With current resources the RAF planned in 1939 to train 5,800 pilots a year, rising to 11,000 pilots a year by 1942.522 This was soon shown to be insufficient.

The pilot-training programme was a vast organisation spread across the British Empire and an essential foundation for the exercise of air power. Imperial War Museum  America, too, constantly revised training programmes in the expectation of a long and large-scale war. In 1939 plans were laid for training 1,200 pilots a year by 1941. In 1940 the plan was raised to 7,000 per year, in 1941 to 30,000. The AWPD Plan 1 argued for an annual output of 85,000 pilots to cope with the maximum contingency of a war with Germany and Japan lasting a number
