lan was raised to 7,000 per year, in 1941 to 30,000. The AWPD Plan 1 argued for an annual output of 85,000 pilots to cope with the maximum contingency of a war with Germany and Japan lasting a number of years. From training 11,000 pilots in 1941 American flying schools trained 82,700 in 1943 in addition to 240,000 ground crew, some fifteen times the number being trained in Japan at the same time.°26 American numbers expanded at a rate faster than necessary, partly because losses were much lower than anticipated, and partly because Arnold, alarmed at the prospect that conscription would reduce the numbers volunteering for air pilot training, embarked on a campaign during 1943 to recruit cadets under 18 years of age and to encourage pre-draft air force enlistment.

With current resources the RAF planned in 1939 to train 5,800 pilots a year, rising to 11,000 pilots a year by 1942.592 This was soon shown to be insufficient. A political initiative waging of successful air warfare.525 the manpower shortage had become a surplus. Air recruitment was cut back substantially to a rate of 60,000 a year, and in April 1944 to 40,000. In order to cope with the demand for air training the educational and physical qualifications were raised at the end of 1943 in contrast to almost all other air powers, where they were lowered.527 In Russia by the same stage of the war the educational requirement for pilot training had been reduced from seven years’ full schooling to five, not because of a shortage of candidates for training, but because of a shortage of those with the necessary qualifications. Soviet air training had run at a high level even before the
