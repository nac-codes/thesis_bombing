hooling to five, not because of a shortage of candidates for training, but because of a shortage of those with the necessary qualifications. Soviet air training had run at a high level even before the outbreak of war, and continued to expand throughout the war from an estimated 18 flying schools in 1938 to 130in 1945, ata rate of more than 60,000 crewmen per year. Training time had to be cut back substantially in 1941 and 1942 to cope with the high loss rate of the early battles in the east. Time spent on advanced training fell from a year to 8 months, and most fighter pilots in 1942 had less than 100 hours’ flying experience instead of the 150-200 enjoyed at the beginning of the war. In 1943 due to the insistence of the supreme command training standards were restored, and once air superiority had been gained in the east were further expanded and extended.528 Because of the limited role of aircraft in the Page 152 of 309 55% A group of British pilots with their American-built A6 trainers at an Advanced Flying Training School in Cranbourne, Rhodesia, in September 1941. The pilot-training programme From training 11,000 pilots in 1941 American flying schools trained 82,700 in 1943 in addition to 240,000 ground crew, some fifteen times the number being trained in Japan at the same time.52° educational and physical qualifications were raised at the end of 1943 in contrast to almost all other air powers, where they were lowered.*9” In Russia by the same stage of the war the educational of the supreme command training standards were restored, and once air superiority had been gained in the east were further expanded and extended.598 Because of the limited role of aircraft in the Russian war the more advanced training in night and blind-flying techniques were less necessary. Had air strategy been different the shortage of specialist training would have limited the use of Soviet aircraft on strategic tasks.  For the Axis powers the expansion of training for pilots, particul
