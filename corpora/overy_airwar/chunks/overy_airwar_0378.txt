ad air strategy been different the shortage of specialist training would have limited the use of Soviet aircraft on strategic tasks.  For the Axis powers the expansion of training for pilots, particularly after the early emphasis on skill to achieve rapid victory which created an underestimate of future needs, proved to be a major problem as the initiative in the war moved in favour of the Allies. Apart from the obvious limit of population resources, which inevitably gave an advantage in sheer numbers to the Allies, the course of the war created further obstacles in providing sufficient personnel. In Japan the flying training programme began far too late to be effective for the combat expected in 1943 and 1944. Having begun the war with some 3,500 army and 2,500 navy pilots, existing facilities provided only 5,000 pilots in 1942 and 5,400 in 1943. With the destruction of the best pilots in the battles from Midway to Rabaul — over 10,000 were killed in 1942 and 1943 — there developed a desperate shortage. New plans for a massive expansion were laid in 1943 to produce 30,000 pilots a year by 1945, but the figure was unrealistic.592 The new recruits had to be sent into battle with only 60 or 70 hours of flying time, against American pilots in better aircraft and with five times the flying experience, which in turn increased the attrition rate, and encouraged the use of recruits with even less training. The spiral of growing attrition finally led to suicide tactics, since ‘special attack group’ training only required some 60 hours’ flying time and the barest of preliminary preparation.©° Another factor in the declining ability of the Japanese air force to provide flying personnel lay with the failure to  Alealata anand neacien Lene Genet a ntiedber ba cant aantenn nnd Ariane nabannla Tha en neele cern thant th ann atlanta ecbann ales 242-14 Laren educational and physical qualifications were raised at the end of 1943 in contrast to almost all other air powers, where they
