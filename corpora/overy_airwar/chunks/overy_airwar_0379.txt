The result was that those pilots whose skills could have been used in forming cadres for training future pilots were instead frittered away in combat. The argument for not resting crews rested on the assumption that warriors should prove their heroism through experiencing hardship, yet further evidence of the way in which an inflexible military tradition failed to take account of the more mundane but nevertheless vital questions of supply.6°1 In the German case it was not tradition that affected training as much as the problems of war. The Luftwaffe was given no priority in gaining qualified recruits, and the demands of the army for manpower in the battles on the eastern front reduced the potential pool of recruits from which the air force could draw. In the winter of 1943-44 some 200,000 men were transferred on Hitler’s orders from the Luftwaffe to the army, and when in 1944 the air force requested that all other forces release suitably qualified men to help to make up the shortage of pilots none was forthcoming.©° The pressure of a manpower shortage coincided with a rapid increase in the loss rate. From the beginning of war until the outbreak of war with Russia monthly losses of aircrew had averaged 615. Between June 1941 and December 1943 the figure rose to 1,167 and in 1944 reached an average of 1,754 per month. The problem of mounting losses escalated as it did in Japan, because the earlier failure to increase Luftwaffe
