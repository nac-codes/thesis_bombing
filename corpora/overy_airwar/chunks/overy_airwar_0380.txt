December 1943 the figure rose to 1,167 and in 1944 reached an average of 1,754 per month. The problem of mounting losses escalated as it did in Japan, because the earlier failure to increase Luftwaffe size gave so great an advantage to the Allies. Allied aircraft were able to exact an increasing rate of loss, and place even greater pressures on a training scheme that was already stretched to the limit. The situation was made worse by Hitler’s and Goering’s insistence that flying instructors and training aircraft should be used in combat. As early as the winter of 1941, when experienced pilots were needed to fly in supplies to the Demyansk pocket, the training schools were required to release skilled personnel. Convinced of early victory Hitler again insisted that present emergencies should have priority over future contingencies by drafting instructors for service in the Mediterranean and the east throughout 1942. When the war did not take the course Hitler had predicted, the training programmes became confused and improvisatory. In addition the shortage of German aircraft, again a result of earlier misjudgement, forced the schools progressively to abandon training on operational types all of which were now sent directly to the front. This was the one stage of the training programme to which both Britain and America gave more, rather than less, emphasis during the later stages of the war. Its decline in Germany left many operational units themselves with the task of giving advanced training to newly posted pilots in the midst of combat. This situation, itself reminiscent of the pressure under which the RAF had operated in 1940, was not necessarily a disadvantage. But when it was combined with both the relative and comparative decline of training standards it became more significant. In 1943, under pressure from the Director of Training, Goering closed down the ‘C’ schools which gave advanced training, particularly in blind flying and navigation. Elementary training
