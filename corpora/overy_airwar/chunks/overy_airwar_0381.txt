significant. In 1943, under pressure from the Director of Training, Goering closed down the ‘C’ schools which gave advanced training, particularly in blind flying and navigation. Elementary training was given on gliders instead of powered aircraft from 1943, partly due to the shortage of fuel which confined flying training in 1944 to 150 hours or less, and in 1945 to 100 hours, and partly due to the accelerating rate of pilot loss that forced the Luftwaffe to cut back training time to less than half that enjoyed by the Allied pilots.£°5 Bomber pilots were  we aA eae heated 7 u 1 yoo tem + toutaA as . ou a4 1  Page 153 of 309 56% educational and physical qualifications were raised at the end of 1943 in contrast to almost all other air powers, where they were lowered.°2” In Russia by the same stage of the war the educational required some 60 hours’ flying time and the barest of preliminary preparation.©° Another factor in the declining ability of the Japanese air force to provide flying personnel lay with the failure to which an inflexible military tradition failed to take account of the more mundane but nevertheless vital questions of supply.6°+ orders from the Luftwaffe to the army, and when in 1944 the air force requested that all other forces release suitably qualified men to help to make up the shortage of pilots none was forthcoming.® Between June 1941 and December 1943 the figure rose to 1,167 and in 1944 reached an average of 1,754 per month.®3 The problem of mounting losses escalated as it did in Japan, because the earlier had predicted, the training programmes became confused and improvisatory.© In addition the shortage of German aircraft, again a result of earlier misjudgement, forced the schools progressively retrained to fly fighters with little success; with mounting losses in all commands, morale declined. The irony was that in both Germany and Japan the output of aircraft actually reached a peak in 1944 at the time when pilot efficiency was in decline
