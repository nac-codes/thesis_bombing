h mounting losses in all commands, morale declined. The irony was that in both Germany and Japan the output of aircraft actually reached a peak in 1944 at the time when pilot efficiency was in decline, the reverse of the position at the beginning of the war, and a reflection of the fact that it took considerably longer to train a pilot than to build an aeroplane. By that stage the initiative had passed to the Allies to such an extent that the new aircraft were destroyed on the ground and in the factories before they could be used. At the end of the war the Japanese air force had 8,000 more crewmen than aircraft. But the weakening of combat efficiency was so widespread that even had more aircraft been available for actual combat at the end of the war it could not have led to a regaining of initiative in the air by the Axis forces. (v) Morale and the Military Tradition The effect of the problems of war on morale, whether of the staff or of the troops, depended to some extent on the simple fact of victory.

Even acceptable loss rates were placed at low levels, particularly in the bombing operations, in order to avoid any decline in combat morale.£°® Among the Axis powers the fact of retreat and defeats, or in Russia the prospect of defeat before 1943, while raising the threshold o
