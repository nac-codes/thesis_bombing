larger industrial base in 1939 than Britain, failed to produce as many aircraft as the British economy until 1944. Nevertheless, even if the Axis powers had given the maximum economic commitment to aircraft production it was a simple economic fact that the British Empire, Russia and the United States were capable of producing a much larger number and weight of aircraft than Germany, Italy and Japan. Some indication of the degree of economic advantage can be gained by a comparison of some basic economic statistics for the pre-war years: these figures are set out in Table 13 below.Â®!2 It should be remembered that the figures before 1939 disguised a number of factors. Britain and America had large unused resources, particularly labour, while Germany had reached a condition of full employment. Secondly in the manufacture of finished goods the disparity between the two sides was wider still. Germany relied heavily on the production of industrial raw materials and capital goods whereas the Allies, and in particular Britain and the United States, had a higher proportion of end-manufacture. This made the task for Germany a different one from that of the Allies. Where Germany had to convert heavy industry to the task of mass production of the finished product, Britain and America had to increase the input of industrial raw materials and machinery to the finishing sector. Of the two tasks the former proved the more difficult under war conditions. All economies faced such questions in the mobilization of resources, the allocation and supply of raw materials and labour, and in the administration of war production. Problems in any one of these areas were capable of reducing what on paper would have appeared a much better production capability than that actually achieved in practice during the war.
