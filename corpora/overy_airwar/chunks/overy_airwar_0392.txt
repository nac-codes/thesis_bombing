The Allied powers enjoyed such an advantage in this respect that their  those produced by their enemies, or to produce aircraft so superior in quality that numbers did not matter. The record of production is set out in Table 12 below.*18 The difference in structure weight performance did not lie simply in the fact that t e Allies together were a more powerful and larger economic force than the Axis powers, although that was certainly the case after the entry of Russia  the pre-war years: these figures are set out in Tal particularly labour, while Germany had reache  heavily on the production of industrial raw mat task for Germany a different one from that of th  ble 13 below.Â®!2 It should be remembered that the figures before 1939 disguised a number of factors. a condition of full employment. Secondly in the manufacture of finished goods the disparity between the two sides was wider still. Germany relied  erials and capital goods whereas the Allies, and in particular Britain and the United States, had a higher proportion of end-manufacture. This made the e Allies.
