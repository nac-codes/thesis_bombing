Britain and America from the outset of war intended to produce very large numbers of aircraft in preference to diverting resources to the other services. This required a very high level of industrial mobilization. Germany and Japan produced insufficient air resources for their purposes because the leadership did not intend to produce more until it was too late. By the time the economic insufficiency had been understood in the middle course of the war it was far too late to switch priorities satisfactorily. Moreover the demands made on the Axis economies by the army or navy made such a switch impossible without severely affecting the fighting ability of the surface forces. Hence Axis economies remained much more committed to army or navy production, and lacked the freedom of choice to produce many more aircraft without exciting tensions between the services, or substantially altering the agreed strategy. Instead great efforts had to be made to increase productivity by making existing resources stretch further. At root the problem lay with the over-optimistic assessment of future needs by the Axis leaders. In Hitlerâ€™s case a relatively low level of aircraft production fitted in with the belief that the war would be a short one, and satisfied the demand for maintaining a high level o
