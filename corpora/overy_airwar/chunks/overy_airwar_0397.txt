by the Axis leaders. In Hitler’s case a relatively low level of aircraft production fitted in with the belief that the war would be a short one, and satisfied the demand for maintaining a high level of consumer goods production. It fitted in, too, with what Page 160 of 309 58% USS.A. 141,940,000 52,800,000 (1940) 32.2 Italy 43,430,000 21,000,000 (1936) ar U.K. 10.5 230.7 25.7 447,561 Goering told him about the limits set by raw materials and factory capacity, an argument that both leaders accepted uncritically.S2° In Japan too little planning had gone into the stage beyond the initial victory, in the misguided expectation of a negotiated settlement with the United States after the end of the southern conquest. In both these cases strategic intention coupled to the existence of other economic priorities reduced the production capacity devoted to aircraft, thus further emphasizing an already existing economic imbalance.  To this was added the question of efficiency. All the major economies found the efficient production of large numbers of aircraft measured in terms of resource utilization difficult to achieve. Aircraft production brought with it several problems of its own. First of all it was the most expensive service, requiring more finance than either of the other two services. Every increase in aircraft production had to be debated with the army and navy. Both services resented the fact that the lion’s share of scarce resources went to the air force, whose function they regarded as auxiliary. Secondly aircraft production was a major user of labour, in particular skilled labour, which was in short supply during the war. Finally aircraft industries had proved to be relatively inefficient users of resources in the 1930s. Usually dependent on a high level of government contracts and finance and hence less dependent on the market, there was insufficient pressure to economize and rationalize.
