The comparative backwardness of the Japanese and Italian economies was an important cause of this disparity, but not the whole cause. In the final full year of war the Japanese economy produced almost as many combat aircraft as the German from a considerably smaller economic base. Where German industry was able to produce aircraft of excellent quality in the kinder economic climate of peace it was unable to satisfactorily solve the question of quantity, even when the leadership finally changed economic strategy in favour of a production effort to match that of the Allies. Planning and organization were the most important stages in aircraft production. How demands for aircraft were formulated determined the performance of the aircraft industry. Any hiatus in the organizational structure for carrying out the production plans was likely to have a considerable influence on the ability of an economy to produce what it was fully capable of producing. For aircraft production such questions were vital. T
