ut the production plans was likely to have a considerable influence on the ability of an economy to produce what it was fully capable of producing. For aircraft production such questions were vital. The product itself was so large and complex and the resources — particularly aluminium, skilled labour and special machinery — in relatively short supply, that the successful planning and co-ordination of production was an essential prerequisite for the fulfilment of any plan.®22 Planning as such operated at a number of different levels, but the general economic strategy in which such planning took place was determined at the top of the political and military machine.

The demands of the services for large numbers of aircraft in turn fuelled the determination of the political leadership to demand economic sacrifices in favour of war production. In Britain the decision to aim high in aircraft production stemmed first and foremost from the central position of air strategy in overall military plans. It stemmed secondly from the fact that the British government expected a much higher level of aircraft output from the Axis powers than was actually achieved, and prepared accordingly. The decision to plan for 2,000 and then 2,500 and 3,000 aircraft a month was based on the assumption that German industry was capable of produci
