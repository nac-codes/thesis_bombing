s than was actually achieved, and prepared accordingly. The decision to plan for 2,000 and then 2,500 and 3,000 aircraft a month was based on the assumption that German industry was capable of producing certainly the same number, and probably slightly more than the British industry.®#3 In America the Air Corps itself had laid modest plans for the expansion in 1940-42 amounting to an initial objective for 5,500 aircraft per year.S24 This reflected the unwillingness of Congress to vote greater funds, but it also revealed the unwillingness of the air force leaders to think of anything more ambitious under conditions of peace. In May 1940 Roosevelt issued a demand for an aircraft programme of 50,000 aircraft by 1942. Faced with such an extraordinary increase in funds and material the air force hesitated to plan the necessary expansion. It was the political persistence of Roosevelt, coupled with the release of the largest single appropriation of federal funds for military purposes in the history of Congress that finally persuaded the air force to accept the new figures, and work on an assumption that from 30-50,000 aircraft a year were to be produced for the duration of the crisis.®25 Roosevelt’s original figure was taken ‘out of the air’ The rhetorical — and political — impact of the 50,000 programme, which became temporarily a major item of public discussion, was in itself an explanation for its origin. In the wake of Pearl Harbor Roosevelt, shocked by the apparent strength of the Japanese air forces, and anxious to satisfy public alarm at the attack, raised the demand for aircraft production to 125,000 a year, of which 100,000 were to be combat aircraft.62° The figures bore no relation to what the industry was capable of producing, nor any relation to what the air forces were demanding. But they did set targets so vast that arguments about the feasibility of the earlier and more realistic air corps programmes disappeared in favour of arguments about the production of
