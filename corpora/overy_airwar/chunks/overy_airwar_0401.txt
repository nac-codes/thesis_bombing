were demanding. But they did set targets so vast that arguments about the feasibility of the earlier and more realistic air corps programmes disappeared in favour of arguments about the production of tens of thousands of aircraft. Such figures were clearly not beyond the scope of the American economy as a whole, and fitted in well with the American intention to create ‘an overwhelming superiority of material’.©2” The war economic authorities, however, saw that to meet the demands of the surface forces, air production would have to be cut back. Although the original Presidential demand had not been an actual order, there was protracted political debate over the decision to reduce the 125,000 goal. Not until autumn 1942 was the programme abandoned in favour of a goal of 90-100,000 in 1943, and throughout the period Nelson as head of the War Production Board insisted that ‘the aircraft programme as a whole be preferred over all other production’.628 That neither the British goal of 36,000 aircraft a year nor the American goal of 125,000 a year were achieved was due not solely to the unrealistic and ‘target’ nature of the planning, but to changes in quality, particularly the transition to heavier four-engined aircraft without which these totals might have been surpassed in 1944. In terms of structure weight Roosevelt’s initial demands were eventually met, and even exceeded. What was important about the programmes was the fact that neither industrial limitations, nor air force conservatism, were allowed to dull the economic imagination of those who were charged with the overall direction of economic and industrial policy. From the 1920s onwards the British and American planners had intended that in the event of war quite a different level of production was to be expected, in which the guesses at future requirements would depend on what sort of war was being fought, and only secondarily on whether the economy could bear the effort.®22 For the Axis powers the situation was
