which the guesses at future requirements would depend on what sort of war was being fought, and only secondarily on whether the economy could bear the effort.®22 For the Axis powers the situation was the exact reverse. This was not just a reflection of the lower priority accorded to aircraft production, since in Japan it enjoyed a priority similar to that enjoyed  Page 160 of 309 58% Was an important Cause OF this disparity, Dut not the whole cause. in the fMnai full year or war the japanese economy produced almost as Many Combat alrcrait as the German from a ConsideraDly aircraft a month was based on the assumption that German industry was capable of producing certainly the same number, and probably slightly more than the British industry.®22 In America the Air Corps itself had laid modest plans for the expansion in 1940-42 amounting to an initial objective for 5,500 aircraft per year.S*4 This reflected the unwillingness of Congress to vote greater funds, but it that from 30-50,000 aircraft a year were to be produced for the duration of the crisis.®2> Roosevelt’s original figure was taken ‘out of the air’ The rhetorical — and political — impact of the 50,000 Japanese air forces, and anxious to satisfy public alarm at the attack, raised the demand for aircraft production to 125,000 a year, of which 100,000 were to be combat aircraft.S26 The figures bore no as a whole, and fitted in well with the American intention to create ‘an overwhelming superiority of material’.627 The war economic authorities, however, saw that to meet the demands of the surface programme as a whole be preferred over all other production’.®28 That neither the British goal of 36,000 aircraft a year nor the American goal of 125,000 a year were achieved was due not solely to the in the Allied economies. Nor was it only a reflection of smaller economic resources. Both Germany and Japan proved able by 1944 to produce four or five times as many aircraft as in the first year of war. In both Germany a
