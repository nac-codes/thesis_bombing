es. Nor was it only a reflection of smaller economic resources. Both Germany and Japan proved able by 1944 to produce four or five times as many aircraft as in the first year of war. In both Germany and Japan however, the leadership failed to impose economic demands that matched strategic demands. The reasons for the failure were complex. In Germany it was clear that Hitler imagined a much greater aircraft production to be in the pipeline than was actually the case. His demand in 1938 for a quintupling of the air force was largely side-stepped by the planners on the argument that industrial capacity and raw material supplies did not support any such programme.®?° From that date onwards until the crisis of aircraft production in the middle of 1941 Hitler paid virtually no attention to the question, satisfied that the performance of the Luftwaffe was not a question of numbers but of tactics. Between 1939 and 1942 the German aircraft industry, the air ministry and the air staff talked a language of production ‘realism’ in which huge future targets were discounted in favour of figures which it was known were realistically capable of fulfilment given the current state of the industry and problems of economic mobilization.S21 No-one was in a position to insist on more effective mobilization and higher aircraft programmes and those who were, such as Goering or Hitler himself, lacked the necessary strategic imagination or remained in ignorance of the true state of affairs.©22 Thus German aircraft planning reached a level of 2,000 per month for 1944 only in September 1941, and did not reach a level of planning of 3,000 a month until a year later. Not until 1944 did the German air ministry begin to discuss plans on the same huge ‘target’ scale as those of the Allies, and by that time the economic effort involved would not have borne fruit in terms of more aircraft for several years.®33  The contrast with the Allied response to planning was partly a result of differences in th
