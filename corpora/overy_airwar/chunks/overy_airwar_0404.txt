There was little open discussion and consultation on the Axis side. There were other problems too. An explanation for the low level of production lay partly in the demands of the air staff itself. When challenged by Milch in 1942 to accept a higher level of fighter production of 360 a month, which was modest by Allied standards, Jeschonnek replied that he ‘would not know what to do with 360 fighters’.©34 But it also lay in the extraordinary inefficiency of German aircraft production, stifled bv a top-heavv air ministrv bureaucracy and excessive demands for technical qualitv and modification from the air force leaders.
