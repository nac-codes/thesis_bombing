acity and raw material supplies did not support any such programme.®2 From that date onwards until the crisis of aircraft production in the middle of 1941 Hitler such as Goering or Hitler himself, lacked the necessary strategic imagination or remained in ignorance of the true state of affairs.®32 Thus German aircraft planning reached a level of 2,000 per month level of fighter production of 360 a month, which was modest by Allied standards, Jeschonnek replied that he ‘would not know what to do with 360 fighters’.®34 But it also lay in the extraordinary inefficiency of German aircraft production, stifled by a top-heavy air ministry bureaucracy and excessive demands for technical quality and modification from the air force leaders. Quality rather than quantity was the first priority, a factor that restricted the industry’s own efforts at greater rationalisation. The fact that even the more modest plans that resulted were unfulfilled by a considerable margin encouraged even the more optimistic authorities in the belief that Germany was producing all of which she was capable.635 In Japan the same confused situation surrounded planning. Actual production in the early years of war, like that of Germany, was not significantly above peace-time levels. This fact was questioned only when the early victories gave way to strategic disaster by the end of 1942. Neither the army nor the navy had any long-term plan for aircraft expansion, nor did there exist any central agency whose task it was to instruct the services in economic possibilities or to plan the mobilization of the civilian economy for war purposes. Only in 1943 with the creation of the Munitions Ministry and the programme of industrial conversion were large numbers at last mooted.£26 As in Germany, however, the large new programmes were unrealizable within a time-scale that would be of any strategic importance to the war effort. The relatively low level of economic mobilization for war, and the inefficiency of the ai
