e German and Japanese case, however, it was the general character of the early strategy and the element of miscalculation as to risks and needs that kept planning levels low, reflecting once again a more fundamental division between those leaderships that thought in terms of economic power, and those that counted upon military prowess. (ii) The Organization of Aircraft Production  Planning the number of aircraft to be produced had to be followed or accompanied by the creation of an organization for putting the planning into practice, and for carrying out further planning. The creation of such an administrative apparatus raised questions about the degree of centralization or de-centralization, about jurisdictional definition and about authority. The response to such organizational problems varied widely between the belligerent powers. Over the question of centralization there existed a paradoxical division between the fascist powers and the Allies. Where the British, American and Soviet governments favoured from the start the creation of an administrative machine that was highly centralized and highly co-ordinated, the Axis, for political reasons as well as for reasons of administrative tradition, followed a largely centrifugal path until persuaded by the inefficiencies of the system to do otherwise.  The British had originally given authority over aircraft production to the air force itself, but as it became obvious during the late 1930s that civilian ministries and departments would have a much more important role to play in the running of the future war economy, more of the control over aircraft resources passed to outside bodies. In 1940 the Ministry of Aircraft Production was established as a separate entity, on the grounds that aircraft were such a complex product that a special department was required to cope with them, and that if such a department remained an integral part of the Air Ministry the latter would be swamped by its supply side at the expense of t
