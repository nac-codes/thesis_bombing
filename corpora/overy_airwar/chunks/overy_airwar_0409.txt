ustrial conversion were large numbers at last mooted.®3° As in Germany, however, the large new programmes were unrealizable within a time-scale that would be of any strategic aircraft per year.®7 In both the German and Japanese case, however, it was the general character of the early strategy and the element of miscalculation as to risks and needs that kept planning levels means worked perfectly, but it worked sufficiently well to avoid the debilitating effect on production of administrative chaos and misjudgement.®2 The same situation prevailed in the United States. Lacking any administrative department capable of assuming responsibility for war production Roosevelt established the National Defense Advisory Council which was placed under the control of the industrialist Knudsen, and was turned during the mobilization period into the Office of Production Management and finally into the War Production Board charged with the general executive administration of the war economy.®“° The Aircraft Production Board was established within the economic organization and although enjoying the same degree of autonomy as MAP in practice, it remained within the central structure for running the war economy and allocating resources. In both the British and American cases considerable attention was paid to the definition of function and the many administrative quarrels — what Churchill praised as ‘honest differences of opinion’ — arose over the working out of jurisdictional competence. Such differences of opinion tended to strengthen rather than weaken the system by arriving, through discussion, at the best level of competent co-operative administration that circumstances would allow.§4!
