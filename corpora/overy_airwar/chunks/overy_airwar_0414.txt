co-operation. Imposing as such production did on so many other economic areas it was clearly important to achieve as high a degree of co-operation and co-ordination as possible while resisting tendencies to fragment the running of aircraft production between too many smaller offices. In both the American and British economic administration special offices were created whose specific task was to co-ordinate.

From 1940 its deputy director was the energetic aircraft designer and producer, Yakovlev.®4?

In Japan the Emperor’s authority was nominal, real power lying with the armed forces and the ministries who were subject to so little general central procurement.®45 In Italy and Japan the same situation emerged. In Japan traditions of military autonomy and a general military distrust of the civilian establishment (and big business in particular) Planning, Programmes and Statistics was placed in such a position that it could see the progress made in the individual departments and ensure that they were as far as possible in balance. In addition information was passed on to all the departments involved of what was happening elsewhere.§*6 The Aircraft Scheduling Unit and later the Aircraft Resources Control Office performed some of the same functions for the American system.®47 Equally important was the whole question of co-operation. Both vertical and horizontal liaison was vital for aircraft production because planning could not be carried out without some knowledge of what was happening in other services or offices, nor without reference to the broader strategic decisions taken at the top of the
