on because planning could not be carried out without some knowledge of what was happening in other services or offices, nor without reference to the broader strategic decisions taken at the top of the administrative tree. Here to some extent the Allies in the west benefited from the decisions taken early in the war to co-operate on questions of production. Although such co-operation never reached the same level as strategic co-operation, the Joint Purchasing Commission, and later the Joint Aircraft Board worked on the allocation of aircraft, standardization procedures and general questions to do with aircraft production planning. The system of co-operation between allies had the advantage that it held each other’s war administration up to scrutiny, and allowed a pooling of administrative experience which led to the final refinements of the administrative process during the course of 1943.48 In the Axis powers the initial inclination to isolationism made co-operation much harder to achieve. Moreover in Germany the hierarchical and formal nature of the bureaucratic structure made what co-operation there was often unmanageable. Udet’s production committee meetings contained over 60 representatives and the proceedings involved so much protocol that agenda could not be completed and decisions had to be postponed for lack of agreement.®42 Co-operation for the purposes of co-ordinating plans and allocating resources failed to materialize.  Where the aircraft production agencies in the Allied powers were themselves established as co-ordinating and co-operative instruments the same was not true elsewhere, or at least not until the shortcomings of the fascist economic administration were finally exposed. In Japan a long struggle developed during 1943 to give more power to the civilian authorities in running the economy. The Cabinet Advisory Board was established to survey the necessary changes and in November 1943 a Munitions Ministry was established with a specific charge to
