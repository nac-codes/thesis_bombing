ion associations under Speer. But even these reforms had only partial success. There was still a central machinery lacking to link the various civilian and military departments together and aircraft production, although subject to considerable internal reforms, remained independent. The struggle for resources continued and the confusion of administrative departments, particularly under the political fact of Goering’s declining influence, became in some ways yet more pronounced. In the end Milch insisted, against Goering’s hostility, on the fusion of aircraft production with the Ministry of War Production through the creation of the ‘Fighter Staff’.©5! The ‘Production Miracle’ that resulted, although planned beforehand by Milch, was only possible because of the final centralization of all production. The persistent difficulties experienced with aircraft production in 1943 and early 1944 were a direct product of the fact that there was still too little administrative co-ordination and too rigid a system of administrative practice. Speer’s control over fighter production brought a degree of flexibility and improvisation into the aircraft economy which it had hitherto lacked. When centralization did come in Germany and Japan it came late, and under conditions of emergency, and although the record of aircraft production improved as a result it was not always possible to eradicate the political and Page 166 of 309 60% information was passed on to all the departments involved of what was happening elsewhere.®4¢ The Aircraft Scheduling Unit and later the Aircraft Resources Control Office performed some of the same functions for the American system.®4” Equally important was the whole question of co-operation. Both vertical and horizontal liaison was vital for aircraft production because planning could the proceedings involved so much protocol that agenda could not be completed and decisions had to be postponed for lack of agreement.§42 Co-operation for the purposes of co-ord
