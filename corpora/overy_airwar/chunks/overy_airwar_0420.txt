ated.  By contrast the homogeneity of the British political, industrial and administrative establishment was a considerable advantage. Lacking a strict bureaucratic tradition and a large reserve of skilled administrators, officials were recruited from industry and politics as well as the Civil Service, to fill administrative posts. Such homogeneity, born largely of a common class experience and a shared environment in Whitehall that was both informal and co-operative, allowed for a greater degree of co-operation and flexibility than might otherwise have been the case. In Germany with a strong tradition of an established bureaucracy it was much harder to break down barriers between departments where, even if recruitment patterns were not markedly different (which was often the case), there were entrenched administrative prerogatives and forms to be maintained. The American system, too, had an ad hoc character, very much in the spirit of federal administrative practice. American administrators were also recruited from a wide spectrum of the managerial and professional elites where there was experience of administration but no bureaucratic tradition. 4  The recruitment of administrators demonstrated a critical difference between the Allied and Axis powers in the degree to which industry was co-opted into the work of organizing aircraft production. One obvious advantage in wedding industrial experience to the running of the war economy was the degree of shared experience between the two situations. In the capitalist west this choice was an obvious one. A war in defence of an economic system represented by a political structure sympathetic to capitalism involved industrialists as closely as it did soldiers. Thus in America the senior administrators of the war economy were almost all drawn from large-scale industry; industry co-operated closely with the authorities and created its own administration in the National ees ant ee ae oe ee wa Te, ee a, ee! ow ae. ee a re Se 2
