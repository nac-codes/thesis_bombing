Since so much of the production of aircraft was a question of proper scheduling and prediction, the experience of the Five Year Plans in precisely those areas made the conversion to wartime administration relatively smooth. Moreover unlike the planning in Italy and Germany, Soviet planning was more directly concerned with the production and distribution of goods, and less with capital flows and trade into which most fascist energy was put.
