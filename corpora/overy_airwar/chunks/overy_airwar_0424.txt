. For the capitalists a low level of economic mobilization meant more civilian production, with higher profit levels, and the opportunity to carry out economic imperialism into the newly conquered areas, a task that in itself diverted considerable administrative and economic effort from the problem of war production.®2  In Germany, too, there were other problems facing the large cartels and trusts, not the least of which was the nature of capitalism itself under the impact of Nazi imperialism. They were involved at first very little in running the war economy. Much economic effort was diverted to keeping civilian production going as well as to the task of competing for resources abroad in the conquered territories. This diversion of industrial effort from the central task of mobilizing the economy for war complemented both the Wehrmacht’s own reluctance to introduce industrialists into the administration of war production and the Nazis’ desire to control and exploit German industry for the war effort by placing severe limits on the activity of big businessmen in national politics. Anxious to preserve the basis of private capitalism, the big firms, while often critical of the Nazi war administration, allowed the bureaucrats and soldiers to arrange the war economy since that was their function.®8 In the case of both Germany and Japan the irony was that they contained the most concentrated industrial structures of all the belligerent powers, with industrialists whose experience of production, predictive planning and economic administration in general was much greater than that of the political and bureaucratic leadership whose orders they followed. This fact became apparent in Germany when first Udet, and then Milch, organized an advisory council of industrialists which had a considerable effect on improving productivity.
