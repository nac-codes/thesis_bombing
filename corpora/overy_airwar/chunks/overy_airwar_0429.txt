In fact over the first three in Britain came in 1940-42.°S! In Japan the problem was a little different. There a small aircraft industry in the mid-1930s had to be turned quickly into a large producer within the severe limits planned for war already existed by the end of 1940 and needed only to be manned and managed by those industries whose civilian production was sharply curtailed on the outbreak of war.®* In this case, as in Germany, the creation of a pre-war aircraft production capacity was related to expected needs, but whereas German capacity was close to full employment by 1940 with few plans for a second major expansion, British capacity was in the early stages of being utilized. The wide margin in production in 1941 between the two powers was a reflection of a different set of investment decisions taken in the pre-war period. The expansion of production was different again for the two largest economies, Russia and the United States. The Russian industry was already the largest in 1939 in terms of current production. The third Five Year Plan gave even greater emphasis to the construction of aircraft facilities which were concentrated in a few giant plants in both eastern and western Russia. At the time of the German invasion plant expansion in Siberia was already taking place in case of such a contingency, and the factories moved eastwards in the evacuation were in many cases married up with facilities that simply needed the addition of men and machinery
