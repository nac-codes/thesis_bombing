eady taking place in case of such a contingency, and the factories moved eastwards in the evacuation were in many cases married up with facilities that simply needed the addition of men and machinery to begin operation. In the east, free from the threat of German bombing and invasion, and compelled to concentrate production because of the lack of an engineering infrastructure into which to disperse, enormous factories were established such as State Aircraft Factory 26 which produced 97,000 Klinov aero-engines in four years on a site of 6 square kilometres. By contrast the largest German manufacturer, Junkers, produced only 89,000 engines over six years at eight different sites.6°3 The same freedom from fear of enemy action allowed the United States to build up large industrial installations and to concentrate production as much as possible. Unlike Russia, America had only a small aircraft industry at the end of the 1930s geared largely to civilian needs. In fact the United States was so far behind the other prospective belligerent powers in terms of aircraft production that both the German and Japanese intelligence services underestimated considerably America’s ability to convert quickly to aircraft production.® In contrast the American industry expanded  Page 170 of 309 62% in Britain came in 1940-42.S°! In Japan the problem was a little different. There a small aircraft industry in the mid-1930s had to be turned quickly into a large producer within the severe limits planned for war already existed by the end of 1940 and needed only to be manned and managed by those industries whose civilian production was sharply curtailed on the outbreak of war.§®?
