Some of the work of expansion had already begun on the basis of orders from Britain and France, but the bulk of the new expansion came from government financing of facilities either at the original aircraft plant or at a new location, chosen because of its proximity to labour and engineering sub- contractors. In all cases, as in Britain, the plants were managed and run by private companies whether they owned them or not. It was only on the basis of the promise of government aid that much of the expansion could take place. So urgent, however, did Congress consider the need for aircraft production that not only were large funds allocated for it during 1940 but the government was authorized to prepare the conversion of other industrial sectors to the programme.®® The expansion of floorspace for aircraft output (including main components) was as follows: Table 14: Floorspace for Aircraft and Main Components Manufacture in the United States 1939-44 (000 sq. ft.)®5°  Date Airframe Engines Propellors Total  Page 171 of 309 62% war by the fact that some 70 per cent of all Spitfire production came from the factory built by the Nuffield Organization in the late 1930s, the largest in Europe. Facilities for the 2,000 aircraft a month planned for war already existed by the end of 1940 and needed only to be manned and managed by those industries whose civilian production was sharply curtailed on the outbreak of war.§© In this case, as in Germany, the creation of a pre-war aircraft production capacity was related to expected needs, but whereas German capacity was close to full employment by 1940 with few plans for 6 square kilometres. By contrast the largest German ma
