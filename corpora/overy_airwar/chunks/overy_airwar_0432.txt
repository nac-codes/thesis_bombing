r aircraft production capacity was related to expected needs, but whereas German capacity was close to full employment by 1940 with few plans for 6 square kilometres. By contrast the largest German manufacturer, Junkers, produced only 89,000 engines over six years at eight different sites.6®3 authorized to prepare the conversion of other industrial sectors to the programme.®> The expansion of floorspace for aircraft output (including main components) was as follows: Table 14: Floorspace for Aircraft and Main Components Manufacture in the United States 1939-44 (000 sq. ft.)&96 1 Jan. 1939 7,479 1,726 250 9,455 1 Jan. 1940 9,606 3,018 492 13,116 1 Jan. 1941 17,943 6,463 1,050 25,456  June 1943 77,536 31,829 5,240 114,605 Dec. 1943 110,423 54,189 6,835 171,447 Dec. 1944 102,951 54,888 7,888 165,727  Beside such figures the efforts to expand plant elsewhere were dwarfed. In Britain productive floorspace at airframe factories expanded from 4.9 million square feet in August 1938 to 22.15 million square feet in October 1941, rising to a peak of 28.8 million square feet in March 1944. In Germany the renewed construction plans begun with the Goering-Programme in 1941 called for an expansion of only 6.6 million square feet for airframe and aero-engine capacity.®°”  One of the main reasons why American capacity was expanded so rapidly lay with the willingness of the government to utilize resources outside the aircraft industry. The main sub-contractor for aircraft production, particularly for the production of engines, was the motor industry. This was not because of any basic similarity of product, except for engines, but because the motor industry had very large production installations, skilled workers and a large supply of tools available for conversion to war purposes. In October 1940 Knudsen compelled the car industry to enter negotiations with the aircraft industry over mobilization and the result was the Automotive Committee for Air Defense. The committee arranged the c
