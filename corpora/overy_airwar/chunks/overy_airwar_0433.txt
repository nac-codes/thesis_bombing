ber 1940 Knudsen compelled the car industry to enter negotiations with the aircraft industry over mobilization and the result was the Automotive Committee for Air Defense. The committee arranged the conversion programmes and negotiated with the government over contracts and finance, insisting that new facilities should be provided and paid for by the state, like the shadow-factory scheme in Britain.6°* Much of the existing motor vehicle capacity was used for trucks, tanks and cars during the war. The contribution of the motor industry was in running and building new plants side by side with their own, or as in the case of the giant Ford plant at Willow Run, building a new plant completely from scratch at a new site.®©° The contribution in terms of management and machinery — some 66 per cent of automobile industry tools in 1942 going into the new aircraft and engine factories — made possible the rapid increase in aircraft output. The motor industry produced over 50 per cent of all aero-engines, and 66 per cent of all combat engines as well as 40 per cent of all airframe production by weight. At its peak the Ford plant for B-24 bombers produced in weight the equivalent of 50 per cent of the peak of German aircraft production on its own.®70 Without the conversion of the motor industry the aircraft producers themselves would have been unable to cope with the scale of contracts available from 1941 onwards, even though they, too, were rapidly expanded in size throughout the period. Other sectors of American industry, notably the domestic appliance and electrical industry were also drafted into the aircraft programme as  Table 14: Floorspace for Aircraft and Main Components Manufacture in the United States 1939-44 (000 sq. ft.)®55 expansion of only 6.6 million square feet for airframe and aero-engine capacity.°5” contracts and finance, insisting that new facilities should be provided and paid for by the state, like the shadow-factory scheme in Britain.£68 Much of the exist
