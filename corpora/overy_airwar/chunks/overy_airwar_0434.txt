In Europe, conversion was much less important except in Britain where a similar relationship with the motor industry was established. The decision in Britain to use the motor industry was an old one which finally bore fruit in the establishment of a special group under Herbert Austin in 1936 charged with the task of finding new or spare capacity for aircraft and engine production.®”1 By 1940 most of the major producers, even including Nuffield despite his reluctance to be directed in his efforts by the state, had plans for conversion to war production, although very few were to build whole aircraft. The MAP preferred to have the converted industry integrated more fully with the established armament firms and both Rolls-Royce and Vickers, the largest aero-engine and aircraft producers, were given charge over ‘shadow’ factories and major sub-contractors, including the large Nuffield plant at Castle Bromwich.®”2 The conversion did not stop with the motor industry. The English Electric Company was drafted in for aircraft work, expanding its facilities from under 300,000 square feet to over 2 million square feet by 1942. In London, nine passenger transport depots were converted for the production of heavy bombers. Throughout the Midlands and the North smaller engineering firms were brought into the programme for sub-assemblies and assemblies, for final aircraft assembly at the large aircraft works. By the end of the war 45 per cent of the crucial heavy bombers had
