ing firms were brought into the programme for sub-assemblies and assemblies, for final aircraft assembly at the large aircraft works. By the end of the war 45 per cent of the crucial heavy bombers had been produced by outside contractors and two-thirds of the standard light bombers. In terms of weight some 22 per cent of all aircraft production was undertaken outside the air firms themselves.” Although this was a smaller contribution than in the United States the programme of conversion planned for from the mid-1930s played an important role, particularly in the early stages of the war, when it was necessary to expand output as rapidly as possible.  By contrast Germany failed to mobilize the motor industry until well into the war, and then with only partial success. The motor industry as a whole ran at only 50 per cent of capacity at its peak for all armaments production. The major plants were only incorporated late into sub-contracting work for aircraft, and never produced completed aircraft. The huge Volkswagen complex remained greatly under-utilized despite Goering’s insistence on bringing it onto the list of firms to be used for air orders.
