e been unable to cope with the scale of contracts available from 1941 onwards, even though they, producers, were given charge over ‘shadow’ factories and major sub-contractors, including the large Nuffield plant at Castle Bromwich.£”2 The conversion did not stop with the motor industry. The terms of weight some 22 per cent of all aircraft production was undertaken outside the air firms themselves.£73 Although this was a smaller contribution than in the United States the programme of partial conversion to aircraft sub-contracting which was so badly planned that tooling had been completed for an obsolescent type shortly before the firm was directed to tool up for a newer model, with the result that the largest continental car firm failed to provide more than a fraction of what it was capable of producing, either for the army or the air force.674 Otherwise the German air ministry depended on the expansion of the established aircraft firms and made little attempt to convert other industrial branches in deference to the demands to maintain consumer output, and in the belief that the current needs could be met for the time being from the existing capacity. In Russia the problem while taking a similar form had a different origin. The engineering industry generally, and the car industry in particular, was too underdeveloped to allow widespread sub- contracting and conversion. In fact in the areas in eastern Russia where the evacuated firms were directed there were so few firms with which contracts could be made that a large proportion of the aircraft parts were made on the premises.§75 The state custom of designating all firms as State Aircraft Factories (GAZ) working on aircraft orders disguised any conversion that might have taken place. The industrial underdevelopment of Japan also made it difficult to convert other industries readily for war purposes. The large aircraft companies were already under the control of the major Zaibatsu so that conversion in this case simplv
