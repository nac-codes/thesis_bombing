Not until the war was well under way did either of the two powers increase the levels of personal taxation necessary to cope with huge war contracts, and even then the level was below that in Britain and America.S”8 This difference in urgency was reflected in the level of expansion of the aircraft industries. Here the crucial question was one of timing. The British effort to reach a canacitv canable af meeting the maximum strategic demands was develoned between 1936 and 1941.
