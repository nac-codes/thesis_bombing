time between the start of an airframe plant and full operation was 31 months, and for aero-engines 23 months. In Germany the bulk aircraft parts were made on the premises.$”> The state custom of designating all firms as State Aircraft Factories (GAZ) working on aircraft orders disguised any conversion that might have taken the quota planned by Todt, while the actual provision for building was in practice only a third of the original quota.*”? Too much money was still tied up, as in Japan, in consumer industries or in below that in Britain and America.S”8 This difference in urgency was reflected in the level of expansion of the aircraft industries. Here the crucial question was one of timing. The British effort to reach replacement of tools and equipment rather than for factory space.£”9 As was to be expected the Axis timing differed in direct proportion to the shifts in Axis strategy. The first expansion period for the of the new large-scale projects never materialized and the new plants for aero-engines in Austria, completed finally by Speer in 1942-43 took over five years from the original directive to the final output of an engine. They never began operating fully as a result of Allied bombing. In view of such difficulties the German air ministry insisted instead on a general dispersal, into both the German and European economies, in order to avoid bombing and to increase production.®8° The dispersal late in the war differed from the conversion for war purposes carried out by the Allies. In the latter case the conversion was pre-planned. Moreover most of the expansion in Britain, America and Russia was in new facilities constructed for the purpose and operated by established aircraft firms or licensees. The German dispersal was into small firms widely scattered over the Reich and occupied Europe. In some cases such dispersal did not represent a net gain, but was cancelled out by facilities abandoned or destroyed in the Reich. Much of it was poorly planned and co
