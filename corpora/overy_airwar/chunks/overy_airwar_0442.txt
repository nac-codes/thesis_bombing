the Reich and occupied Europe. In some cases such dispersal did not represent a net gain, but was cancelled out by facilities abandoned or destroyed in the Reich. Much of it was poorly planned and co-ordinated because carried out under increasingly improvised economic and administrative conditions.*®1 Most of the new contracts went to firms with little experience of large-scale production of anything as complicated as an aircraft, or aero-engine. Most aircraft firms resisted dispersal until it became unavoidable. By 1943 it had become clear that larger factories rather than more smaller ones were what were needed to expand German output. Nevertheless, for want of an alternative due to the strategic miscalculations of the early years, dispersal did allow the German aircraft industry to survive longer into 1944 and 1945 then might otherwise have been the case. The same was true in Japan where decentralization had to be hurriedly introduced late in 1944 under the threat of heavy bombing. By March of the following year the major Mitsubishi and Nakajima plants had dispersed 60 per cent of their tools to small production units scattered in the countryside, or in less vulnerable urban areas.§82 Like their German counterparts the manufacturers resisted dispersal for as long as possible in order to meet the increased production demands for aircraft. In January they were finally compelled by imperial decree to disperse and to use underground facilities, as in Germany. Underground facilities provided a means for supplying a basic minimum of armament, but were difficult to maintain, and  en A Lane nan Ae been Anand cirnen tan neal tn nann elt tn AG aint nen dee ntinn AL alenen fe Nn fant an ei Ane e nse d fa ntaeinn cirnen aenntnd elante an thn nee fa nn cirnen Anntenernd Ler ba lin a an thane Lath  Page 174 of 309 64% SES Saas Eee Shee eee the quota planned by Todt, while the actual provision for building was in practice only a third of the original quota.£”” Too much money w
