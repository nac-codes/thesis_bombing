was also a question of how efficiently such capacity was utilized. That great gains in war production could be made by utilizing resources better was demonstrated everywhere. In aircraft production in particular the nature of the product encouraged production inefficiencies. So much of the final assembly was a question of organizing the supply and flow of numerous components. Bottlenecks in the supply of parts held up the output of finished aircraft even in the United States. Aircraft were also constantly undergoing modifications in design. If such changes were incorporated in a model currently in large-scale production further delays were the result. Some major model types underwent in excess of 50,000 minor design changes in the course of a production life. Aircraft production was hard to convert to methods of mass production, because not all parts of the process of building and assembly could be mechanized, and there always existed the danger that the supply of parts would be thrown out of balance because of the contrast between mechanized and partially mechanized suppliers. One of the greatest barriers to efficient production was ignorance. Managerial conservatism led to resistance to new methods and a general scepticism over the ability of rationalization to improve productivity in an industry with a specialized product and a history of poor productivity performance. Conservative managers were sometimes supported in such views by airmen, equally unfamiliar with industrial methods, who were anxious to preserve quality at the cost of quantity by authorizing numerous design changes, or new models for production. below that in Britain and America.£78 This difference in urgency was reflected in the level of expansion of the aircraft industries. Here the crucial question was one of timing. The British effort to reach replacement of tools and equipment rather than for factory space.£72 As was to be expected the Axis timing differed in direct proportion to the shifts
