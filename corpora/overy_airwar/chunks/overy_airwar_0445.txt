The first expansion period for the because carried out under increasingly improvised economic and administrative conditions.®8! Most of the new contracts went to firms with little experience of large-scale production of anything as German and Japanese aircraft production was carried on in the final months of war from a rapidly shrinking industrial foundation.*83 In the United States the effort devoted to aircraft production also The result of such attitudes was widely differing levels of efficiency. Measured in terms of airframe weight produced per man-day the following table shows the contrast between American and Axis efficiency:  Table 15: Output of Aircraft in Pounds per Man-day in Japan, Germany and the U.S.A. 1941-45985 Year as % as %  Page 175 of 309 64% were needed to expand German output. Nevertheless, for want of an 1 alternative due to the strategic miscalculations of the early years, dispersal did allow the German aircraft industry to survive longer March of the following year the major Mitsubishi and Nakajima plants had dispersed 60 per cent of their tools to small production units scattered in the countryside, or in less vulnerable urban areas.®82 urgently elsewhere.
