labour, floorspace and materials improved in efficiency over the course of the war. In Britain the Production Efficiency Board, set up by MAP in 1943, gave advice and recommendations on rationalization. In Germany a special rationalization drive was initiated in 1941 to help with the new production programmes. By 1943 regular surveys of the industry were carried out in order to assess the effect of schemes to improve productivity.®®¢ In Japan in 1943 the realization of how inefficiently production resources were being utilized led to considerable efforts to enforce efficiency. Nevertheless, substantial differences survived between the industries of the belligerent powers to suggest that efficiency was as important as capacity in determining aircraft output.  To a great extent gains in efficiency depended on changes in scale. The aircraft industry had been small in scale during the 1930s. Under conditions of war it became necessary to move to large- scale production. The larger the factory, the greater the opportunity for economies of scale and organization. In Russia and the United States aircraft and aero-engine factories were on average much larger than in Europe. Japan, too, operated a number of very large plants, if much less efficiently. The average size of American airframe factories was two million square feet. In Britain the figure was an average of 0. 75 million sq. ft. 887 although the production at the main British factories for combat aircraft was ona much larger scale than the average. Spitfires were produced at the rate of  Page 176 of 309 64% Table 15: Output of Aircraft in Pounds per Man-day in Japan, Germany and the U.S.A. 1941-45685 as % Japan of U.S.A.
