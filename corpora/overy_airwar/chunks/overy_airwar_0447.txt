production programmes. By 1943 regular surveys of the industry were carried out in order to assess the effect of schemes to improve productivity.®86 In Japan in 1943 the was an average of 0.75 million sq. ft.,§8” although the production at the main British factories for combat aircraft was on a much larger scale than the average. Spitfires were produced at the rate of 320 per month in the peak quarter at Castle Bromwich.®88 By comparison the peak output of the largest Russian factory reached 1,500 per month, and in the American industry 500 per month.®82 In both Britain and Germany the average factory size tended to be smaller, with those in Germany the smallest of all. In Germany the largest producer, Junkers, had only two factories in 1944 with over 10,000 employees, one of 14,000 and another of 12,000. Britain by comparison had 12 factories of over 10,000 including two firms of 25,000 employees each, which in turn contrasted with American experience in which the majority of aircraft factories employed between 20,000 and 40,000.6°° Moreover, the contrast developed further in sub-contracting practice. In Germany and Britain small firms were drafted in for aircraft production work. At the peak MAP had contracts with 12,000 firms, the German air ministry with over 17,000, many of these in workshops employing only a handful of workers.°*1 In America small businesses were starved of orders and even after legislation compelling the large munitions firms to place contracts with smaller firms, the situation continued. Aircraft manufacturers argued that small firms were too inefficient to cope with the scale of orders, and preferred to sub-contract to medium and large companies.22  The major advantage of larger scale was the greater opportunity it gave to the introduction of more modern factory methods. Aircraft production in the early 1930s did not lend itself easily to such methods. Production was usually carried out in workshop batches with workers moving from aircraft
