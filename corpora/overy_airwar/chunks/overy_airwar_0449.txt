s to place contracts with smaller firms, the situation continued. Aircraft manufacturers argued that small firms were too inefficient to cope with the scale of orders, and preferred to sub-contract to medium and large companies.§92 aircraft from stage to stage of its assembly, while conveyor belts fed parts into the main line at appropriate points. Workers were scheduled carefully to perform particular tasks at particular sites along the assembly line, while general-purpose tools were replaced by special machinery designed for a higher level of automation. A high degree of standardization and interchangeability was introduced and handwork reduced to a minimum.®3 Methods such as these were widely adopted throughout American aircraft and components factories. Aero-engine production was more automated than final airframe production, as was the output of sub-assemblies. There were limits to the extent to which aircraft could be handled by machinery on an assembly line. Nevertheless the Ford plant at Willow Run, despite opposition to the scheme from the air authorities, undertook to mass-produce the B-24 bomber, and by breaking production down into 20,000 separate operations it was finally achieved in 1944. The plant became the only one of its kind to integrate car manufacturing methods and experience completely with that of aircraft.6°4 A high degree of automation and rationalization emerged in British aircraft firms as well, some of it based on American experience, and through the use of American advisers and special machinery (as in the Soviet Union).®%* The fact that the car industry was brought into aircraft production, even though less extensively than in the United States, gave British industry the opportunity to adopt the best known practices from commercial mass-production experience. British factory practice was still far below that of the most efficient American firms but not as far as many people feared. British developments in the mass consumer goods industr
