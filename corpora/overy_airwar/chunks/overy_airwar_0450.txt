British developments in the mass consumer goods industry in the 1920s and 1930s had made it essential to adopt more modern factory methods to survive.

In Germany and Japan such changes were less successful, although both countries might have come closer to the level of British performance had it not been for the economic dislocation of bombing and blockade.®2¢ In Germany the aircraft factories were slow to adopt new methods and were permeated by many built-in inefficiencies which it proved hard to overcome. One of the hardest was the degree of handwork involved in produc
