aircraft factories were slow to adopt new methods and were permeated by many built-in inefficiencies which it proved hard to overcome. One of the hardest was the degree of handwork involved in producing aircraft. Handworker methods survived through the legacy of the early industry in the 1930s and because of the high degree of skill acquired by the individual Meister (the master-craftsmen) through a long and rigorous apprenticeship. The workforce resisted attempts to undermine the skills or to dilute the workforce by using new methods and semi-skilled labour. Batch production gave way only slowly to line production, while time-and-motion studies on which American practice rested were either not introduced or where they were, proved unworkable because of the traditional methods of work payment and use of skills. Conveyor belt production and rational factory organization developed only slowly and many factories still had little evidence of modern methods even by 1945.27 The use of capacity was so inefficient that when Milch compelled some degree of improvement in 1942 the industry was able to produce another 40 per cent more aircraft with virtually the same amount of labour and less aluminium than the year before.§°8 Japanese factory methods were even more primitive. Lacking a sufficiently strong machine-tool industry, or sufficient trained men, and relying on small suppliers with very widely differing standards rationalization was difficult to effect. The problem was the consequence partly of competition between the army and navy who could not even agree on a common voltage for electrical components until late in the war.®2° But as in Germany a major barrier to greater efficiency was the problem of organizing and scheduling the flow of production. Production scheduling was a widespread problem. In nearly all American, and an important number of British firms, some system of production control was introduced during the war to cope with the buying in of parts and thei
