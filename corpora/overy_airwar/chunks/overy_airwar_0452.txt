was a widespread problem. In nearly all American, and an important number of British firms, some system of production control was introduced during the war to cope with the buying in of parts and their rational scheduling for use in the factory. Without such systems aircraft production was continually threatened by a shortage of vital components or materials. In Germany reliance on a large number of small contractors, which expanded after the dispersal forced by bombing, led to constant interruptions to the flow of parts for assembly. Britain, too, had found the same problem at the time of the Blitz, and had introduced a system whereby crucial parts were made in two or three establishments so that interruption by one firm could be compensated for by expanding production at another. But even in Britain the difficulties persisted long after the threat from bombing had disappeared.?° Similar schemes introduced in Germany and Japan broke  Page 178 of 309 65% of workers.®*! In America small businesses were starved of orders and even after legislation compelling the large munitions firms to place contracts with smaller firms, the situation continued. Aircraft manufacturers argued that small firms were too inefficient to cope with the scale of orders, and preferred to sub-contract to medium and large companies.§22 introduced and handwork reduced to a minimum.*3 the only one of its kind to integrate car manufacturing methods and experience completely with that of aircraft.694 A high degree of automation and rationalization emerged in British aircraft firms as well, some of it based on American experience, and through the use of American advisers and special machinery (as in the Soviet Union).§°> The fact that the car industry was brought into aircraft bombing and blockade.®°¢ In Germany the aircraft factories were slow to adopt new methods and were permeated by many built-in inefficiencies which it proved hard to overcome. One of the hardest had little evidence of modern me
