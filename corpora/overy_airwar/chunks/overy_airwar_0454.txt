ion, as well as constant and frustrating interruption to the flow of resources.  (vi) Labour and Raw Materials  Differences in the way in which capital was utilized were reflected in the whole question of labour utilization. Labour was a crucial factor in aircraft production because of the numbers involved. Aircraft industries took the largest slice of the available civilian workforce. The mobilization of labour resources, like that of capital, involved a question of scale on the one hand — how many workers could the aircraft industrv obtain: and of efficiencv — how productive the workforce could be. All the combatant powers enormouslv exvanded the available workforce over the war veriod as the the only one of its kind to integrate car manufacturing methods and experience completely with that of aircraft.694 A high degree of automation and rationalization emerged in British aircraft firms as well, some of it based on American experience, and through the use of American advisers and special machinery (as in the Soviet Union).§95 The fact that the car industry was brought into aircraft bombing and blockade.®* In Germany the aircraft factories were slow to adopt new methods and were permeated by many built-in inefficiencies which it proved hard to overcome. One of the hardest had little evidence of modern methods even by 1945.59? The use of capacity was so inefficient that when Milch compelled some degree of improvement in 1942 the industry was able to produce another 40 per cent more aircraft with virtually the same amount of labour and less aluminium than the year before.®°8 Japanese factory methods were even more primitive. Lacking a sufficiently for by expanding production at another. But even in Britain the difficulties persisted long after the threat from bombing had disappeared.” Similar schemes introduced in Germany and Japan broke could the aircraft industry obtain; and of efficiency — how productive the workforce could be.
