All the combatant powers enormously expanded the available workforce over the war period as the following table shows:  Table 16: Labour in the Aircraft Industry at Selected Dates 1940-45702  1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 973,000 1,259,400 1,526,000 1,678,200 1,440,300 1,107,200 200,000 347,000 471,000 1,345,600 2,102,000 1,464,000 350,000 500,000 - - 750,000  Germany 1,000,000 1,850,000 1,800,000 ~ 276,136 300,000 452,330 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 U.K. A 973,000 1,259,400 1,526,000 1,678,200 1,440,300 U.S.A.

Although there were large increases in the size of the workforce, all the powers experienced a problem of labour shortage. To some extent the shortages were an illusion created by the fierce struggle for labour resources between the services and the different branches of industry. Firms and services were encouraged to inflate demands as a tactical device in the hope that by setting unrealistically high demands there would be a greater chance of obtaining what was really needed. Moreover little attempt was made to assess how labour needs would change under conditions of large-scale semi- automated production. Initial estimates were often sharply reduced once labour-saving production planning was introduced with the more rational
