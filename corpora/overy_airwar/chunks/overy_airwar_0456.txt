eeds would change under conditions of large-scale semi- automated production. Initial estimates were often sharply reduced once labour-saving production planning was introduced with the more rational factory methods. In Britain and America the aircraft industry enjoyed the first priority for most of the war in the allocation of workers. In fact so much so that in 1943 MAP’s priority was finally removed to ensure a fairer distribution of workers to other requirements, and in the United States an excess developed which forced a cutback in numbers of 20 per cent during the course of 1944.73 The problem of recruitment in the western powers was solved by the mobilization of women and the movement of men from inessential production or unemployment to war work. By the end of the war over a third of the workforce in both countries was female. In America the adoption of new production methods also made it possible to recruit unskilled labour. Large new sources of such labour were tapped in the inner regions of the United States where the aircraft industry had only 6 per cent of its workforce in 1942. By the end of the war over 50 per cent of the workforce, much of it unskilled, was concentrated in the central industrial districts. In order to preserve the necessary skilled labour to work with the unskilled a system of reserved occupations and factories was operated, but dilution of skills was widespread. Conscription tended to take the vounger. semi-skilled men who could be replaced either bv older men or by using women and students.2° The same labour catchment area was adopted through necessitv in the Soviet Union.
