This workforce was largely unskilled as far as aircraft producers were concerned, and little effort was made to allocate workers with appropriate skills to the right job in the Reich.2°8 One problem that a relatively low level of labour mobilization posed was the difficulty of operating on a shift system. Although the ministry had intended from the start of the war that a two- or three-shift system should become the norm many aircraft factories were still working one shift only even by 1944.799 Where Russian and British factories worked round-the-clock to cope with the production made necessary by crisis in 1940 and 1941, the German industry lacked the urgency to move to shift working and fell back on the areiimant that tan faururarlzare anaiuld ha faund aran far narmal dawurrls Tha Failiva ta adant chift uraeline alon vaflantad a Fane af tha affant nf unencial hauvre an tha urmrelfaraa a fantar uthich lad ta negligible, particularly in the aircraft industry.” In the struggle for labour resources the air ministry was at a considerable disadvantage politically, since labour recruitment and allocation was in from Europe.?°” Over the whole period the army continued to recruit skilled workers even in the protected factories.

Although the ministry had argument that too few workers could be found even for normal day work. The failure to adopt shift working also reflected a fear of the effect of unsocial hours on the workforce, a factor which led to a falling off in night-shift work in Britain, too, after the middle of the war.”° Hitler’s anxiety to placate the workforce, and his personal intervention to prevent female labour mobilization together contributed to a comparatively low level of
