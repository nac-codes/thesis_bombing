too, after the middle of the war.”° Hitler’s anxiety to placate the workforce, and his personal intervention to prevent female labour mobilization together contributed to a comparatively low level of both capital and labour utilization. Japan had similar policies on labour mobilization, although gradually the proportion of women coming into the aircraft industry expanded under the urgent aircraft expansion programme of 1943-44. Not until the need for more aircraft production was made apparent did efforts begin to recruit students, Koreans and women in large numbers for war production. At the same time, however, large numbers of skilled workers were recruited for the services. The army refused to acknowledge the priority for naval work and continued up to 1945 to recruit skilled labour from naval aircraft firms as well as from its own factories to such an extent that an already small skilled engineering corps was diluted to the level of one skilled foreman for every 2,000 unskilled operatives. So poor was the quality of the largely untrained workforce that an estimated 30 per cent of all engine parts proved to be unusable because of poor workmanship.“ The whole question of efficient use of labour was related, as the Japanese case showed, to the nature of the labour recruited. There was obviously a problem if too little skilled labour was available. The dilution of the workforce to the extent that only 10 per cent of aircraft workers could be regarded as skilled, in what was already a technically backward industry by Allied standards, sharply reduced the ability of the Japanese to produce large numbers of technically sound aircraft.712 Yet there was also a danger of relying too much on skilled labour. The fact that emerged most clearly from the experience of labour mobilization was that unskilled labour, provided it was adequately trained, and provided that more mechanized and routine production methods could be introduced, was more productive than labour in the pre-w
