zation was that unskilled labour, provided it was adequately trained, and provided that more mechanized and routine production methods could be introduced, was more productive than labour in the pre-war aircraft industry with its high reliance on skilled workers. In the United States the dilution of the workforce was readily accepted because of the use made of new factory methods. Airframe weight per employee/month increased from 21 pounds in January 1941 toa peak of 96 pounds in May 1944.713 Aircraft production itself was broken down into a long series of easily learnt processes which required the minimum of manual skill. In Britain and Germany, however, the habit of using highly skilled workers was hard to lose. In Britain the dilution of labour only began in earnest after 1941 when the trade unions finally agreed to accept it, but it gradually became a fact of life. Moreover by 1943-44, when MAP labour demands were cut dramatically, it was discovered that even a comparatively low level of improvement in factorv methods led to substantial improvements in productivitv.24  Page 182 of 309 66% negligible, particularly in the aircraft industry.2° In the struggle for labour resources the air ministry was at a considerable disadvantage politically, since labour recruitment and allocation was in from Europe.?°7 Over the whole period the army continued to recruit skilled workers even in the protected factories. In all the aircraft factories an average of between 45 and 50 per cent of the intended from the start of the war that a two- or three-shift system should become the norm many aircraft factories were still working one shift only even by 1944.792 Where Russian and British a falling off in night-shift work in Britain, too, after the middle of the war.71° Hitler’s anxiety to placate the workforce, and his personal intervention to prevent female labour mobilization together the quality of the largely untrained workforce that an estimated 30 per cent of all engine parts
