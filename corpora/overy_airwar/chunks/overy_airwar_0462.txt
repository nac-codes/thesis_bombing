to placate the workforce, and his personal intervention to prevent female labour mobilization together the quality of the largely untrained workforce that an estimated 30 per cent of all engine parts proved to be unusable because of poor workmanship.2! reduced the ability of the Japanese to produce large numbers of technically sound aircraft.22 Yet there was also a danger of relying too much on skilled labour. The fact that emerged most clearly from of new factory methods. Airframe weight per employee/month increased from 21 pounds in January 1941 to a peak of 96 pounds in May 1944.73 Aircraft production itself was broken down into a it was discovered that even a comparatively low level of improvement in factory methods led to substantial improvements in productivity.244  In Germany the task of dilution was more complicated. First of all the Meister resisted the reduction in training time and the changes in apprenticeship regulations necessitated by wartime conditions. Secondly the aircraft firms had always relied heavily for production on a high degree of skilled work, and the factory methods had been introduced in the expectation that such methods, and the high quality of finish required for aircraft, would be maintained under war conditions. In addition the use of small sub-contracted firms encouraged the retention of an unnecessarily high level of skilled labour since smallness of scale discouraged the production innovation necessary for the use of less skilled workers. The preoccupation with skilled labour then became an obsession with the ministry as well. For the first two or three years of war the skilled labour shortage was combated by every means possible in defence of the high standards of workmanship traditionally associated with German engineering. So much so that most aircraft firms habitually blamed labour shortages as the explanation for poor performance. Trapped to some extent in a situation of high skilled-labour input neither the industry nor the
