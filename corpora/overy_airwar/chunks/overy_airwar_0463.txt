so that most aircraft firms habitually blamed labour shortages as the explanation for poor performance. Trapped to some extent in a situation of high skilled-labour input neither the industry nor the Luftwaffe appreciated early enough the advantages to be gained from using unskilled labour with different production methods. The shortage of engineers was thus exaggerated by the commitment to high standards of workmanship anda large skilled workforce. The lack of engineers was real enough and had been a habitual problem since  anna ro tao aA . 1 Sn a re 1 oad yas aed negligible, particularly in the aircraft industry.7째째 In the struggle for labour resources the air ministry was at a considerable disadvantage politically, since labour recruitment and allocation was in from Europe.?째 Over the whole period the army continued to recruit skilled workers even in the protected factories. In all the aircraft factories an average of between 45 and 50 per cent of the appropriate skills to the right job in the Reich.7째8 One problem that a relatively low level of labour mobilization posed was the difficulty of operating on a shift system. Although the ministry had intended from the start of the war that a two- or three-shift system should become the norm many aircraft factories were still working one shift only even by 1944.702 Where Russian and British the quality of the largely untrained workforce that an estimated 30 per cent of all engine parts proved to be unusable because of poor workmanship.71 reduced the ability of the Japanese to produce large numbers of technically sound aircraft.712 Yet there was also a danger of relying too much on skilled labour. The fact that emerged most clearly from it was discovered that even a comparatively low level of improvement in factory methods led to substantial improvements in productivity.714 engineers was thus exaggerated by the commitment to high standards of workmanship and a large skilled workforce. The lack of engineers was real eno
