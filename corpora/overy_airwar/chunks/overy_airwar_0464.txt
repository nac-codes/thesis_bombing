led to substantial improvements in productivity.714 engineers was thus exaggerated by the commitment to high standards of workmanship and a large skilled workforce. The lack of engineers was real enough and had been a habitual problem since the 1930s, finding its root cause in the rapid decline in enrolment at German technical engineering schools after 1933. But where elsewhere the lack was overcome by doing without skilled men, in Germany it remained a basic bottleneck until dilution was finally accepted late and hurriedly in 1944.715 The price paid for a very high standard of finish was a smaller number of aircraft completed. When the dilution could no longer be ignored or resisted, firms began to introduce more rationalization and the productivity performance began to rise. It was an eloquent tribute to the effectiveness of unskilled labour that peak German and Japanese aircraft production was achieved at the period of peak labour dilution. Labour productivity was also related to conditions, which depended in turn on the political as much as the economic environment. Conditions, for example, in the Soviet Union were considerably below those regarded as acceptable in the western industrial powers, Allied and Axis. Not only were workers conscripted and moved to the aircraft plants, pay and rations were both low. In the period of evacuation workers were compelled to operate machines in the open, and in factories with earth floors.“ Yet although productivity remained relatively low — estimated at a third that of American aircraft industry — the Russian workforce faced special circumstances in defence against Germany, and shared hardships in the prospect of victory. In the Soviet Union resistance against conditions was politically unacceptable, as it was in Germany and Japan. In all three cases labour was compelled to accept conditions imposed from above, Unions had been abolished and the right to strike suspended. The response to the situation led in Germany to high
