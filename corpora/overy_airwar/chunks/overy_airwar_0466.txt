sm, labour obstructionism and high labour turnover.27 In Japan conscripted labour was compelled to go where with some circumspection, wage rates did not keep pace with the rate of inflation and forced labour was poorly rewarded. The only thing that pushed wages up was competition between the firms in what became a black-market for labour operating side by side with the official government controls.22 In the west there was a different political climate. Both government and labour had an interest in establishing grounds for co-operation. Although widespread controls were introduced over the allocation of labour, and strikes were difficult to start, labour policies were pursued as far as possible in co-operation with the trade union organizations. As a result conditions of work were subject to negotiation, while the labour market worked in favour of workers due to scarcity. In Britain it was agreed that differences in wage levels for workers moved from high-wage to low-wage areas would be paid for by the state, while wage levels in war industry as a whole rose in step with inflation.22Â° To get around the problem of high labour costs that this situation produced the new factory methods were essential. In the United States labour cost per pound of airframe weight fell by two-thirds between 1941 and 1944.72! In countries like Germany and Japan, where production methods were not changed rapidly enough, labour costs were partly responsible for compelling those changes that finally did take place, although by the end of the war the degree of compulsory and slave labour in the fascist powers reduced the overall labour cost substantially at the expense of labour conditions. Such direct physical exploitation was a false economy, however, because forced labourers although contributing to the overall increase in productivity brought about by the use of unskilled labour and new methods were unwilling and apathetic workers.
