obstructionism and high labour turnover.”!” In Japan conscripted labour was compelled to go where be paid for by the state, while wage levels in war industry as a whole rose in step with inflation.7“° To get around the problem of high labour costs that this situation produced the new factory methods value because of the poor quality of work and lack of experience in plywood and resin technology.”23 Resource limitation was also a result of how successfully aircraft production could compete for declined between 1939 and 1941 while imports increased by almost 250 per cent over the same period.724 Although aluminium exports provided some difficulties for American industry in the early period of expansion the War Production Board argued that the problem was self-imposed through poor distribution and hoarding. By 1943 these problems had been eliminated through better scheduling of raw materials through the Controlled Materials Plan and the AAF scheduling unit.725 Three large new aluminium plants were actually cancelled in 1943 for fear of excess production. Aluminium supplies in Germany, Japan and Italy were also considerably expanded. As the world’s largest producer in 1939 Germany did not anticipate aluminium shortages. Nevertheless the Luftwaffe had to fight for its claim to aluminium just as it fought for labour and other resources. Where the Allied powers reserved aluminium almost completely for air force use, and even in the United States some 80 per cent of production was scheduled for the air forces, the Luftwaffe only obtained 45 per cent of supplies in 1939 and no more than 60 per cent in 1944 when every effort was made to expand aircraft output.726 In defence of such allocation the other users accused the aircraft industry of hoarding and inefficient use. Both charges proved true. Wasteful shop methods combined with inter-firm rivalry had led to enormous wastage, but the greatest source of wastage had been in Udet’s initial decision to allocate seven to eight
