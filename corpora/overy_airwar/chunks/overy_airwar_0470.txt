rges proved true. Wasteful shop methods combined with inter-firm rivalry had led to enormous wastage, but the greatest source of wastage had been in Udet’s initial decision to allocate seven to eight tons of aluminium per aircraft, greatly in excess of needs. This miscalculation encouraged hoarding and led to high levels of scrapping. Milch discovered that over half a ton of aluminium was wasted in the production of each aero-engine.727 In Japan aluminium allocation had also been at too high a level, dropping from eight tons per aircraft in early 1942 to two to three tons by the end of the war. Japanese firms were also found to be hoarding the metal and using it for inessential civilian production.”28 In Britain strict controls over civilian use and careful scheduling produced a much larger number of aircraft from a smaller aluminium base. Thus in 1941 Britain produced some 20,094 aircraft from 161,000 tons of aluminium produced and imported, whereas Germany produced 11,776 from total production and imports of 382,000 tons, of which 206,000 tons were allocated to the Luftwaffe.722 Although Milch was able to improve the distribution of the material, the German war economy failed to give sufficient Page 184 of 309 67% of evacuation workers were compelled to operate machines in the open, and in factories with earth floors.“ Yet although productivity remained relatively low — estimated at a third that of American suspended. The response to the situation led in Germany to high levels of absenteeism, labour obstructionism and high labour turnover.72” In Japan conscripted labour was compelled to go where never rose beyond 50 per cent of that paid to men. Moreover, despite the wartime inflation wage rates rose only slowly because of controls over labour.”48 In Germany too, although labour was treated be paid for by the state, while wage levels in war industry as a whole rose in step with inflation.”° To get around the problem of high labour costs that this situation produce
