ough labour was treated be paid for by the state, while wage levels in war industry as a whole rose in step with inflation.”° To get around the problem of high labour costs that this situation produced the new factory methods were essential. In the United States labour cost per pound of airframe weight fell by two-thirds between 1941 and 1944.72 In countries like Germany and Japan, where production methods were not of bombing the result was widespread demoralization and absenteeism.222 Where direct political oppression was added to the fear of economic decline under conditions of wartime finance, the value because of the poor quality of work and lack of experience in plywood and resin technology.723 Resource limitation was also a result of how successfully aircraft production could compete for excess of needs. This miscalculation encouraged hoarding and led to high levels of scrapping. Milch discovered that over half a ton of aluminium was wasted in the production of each aero-engine.722 hoarding the metal and using it for inessential civilian production.728 In Britain strict controls over civilian use and careful scheduling produced a much larger number of aircraft from a smaller priority to air force needs with the result that many more aircraft could have been produced from an abundant material in which most other belligerents experienced real shortages.  From some limitations, however, there was no escape. Heavy machinery and special machine tools were in short supply for aircraft production everywhere, but the size and experience of the American and British special machinery industries more than compensated for Germany’s larger supply of general purpose tools. Japan and Italy were generally short of most tools, specialized or otherwise and during the war only limited success was achieved in increasing engineering supplies.72° Limitations imposed by energy supplies and transport were also widespread.
