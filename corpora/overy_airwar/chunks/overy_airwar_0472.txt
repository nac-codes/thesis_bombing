In the United States labour cost per pound of airframe weight fell by two-thirds between 1941 and 1944.71 In countries like Germany and Japan, where production methods were not value because of the poor quality of work and lack of experience in plywood and resin technology.?23 Resource limitation was also a result of how successfully aircraft production could compete for declined between 1939 and 1941 while imports increased by almost 250 per cent over the same period.7#4 Although aluminium exports provided some difficulties for American industry in the early excess of needs. This miscalculation encouraged hoarding and led to high levels of scrapping. Milch discovered that over half a ton of aluminium was wasted in the production of each aero-engine.72? hoarding the metal and using it for inessential civilian production.?28 In Britain strict controls over civilian use and careful scheduling produced a much larger number of aircraft from a smaller war through blockade and bombing on these particular sectors was in the end critical for both the German and Japanese industrial structures. Nevertheless even these limitations proved to be a spur to greater production efforts both through increasing the scale of planning and improving efficiency.
