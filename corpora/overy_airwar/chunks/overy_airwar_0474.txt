comparative failure in the field of aircraft output rests with one critical residual difference between the Axis and Allied powers in the way in which aircraft models were selected and design changes incorporated. Well-organized product selection was vital in aircraft production. The design and production development of aircraft was a long and expensive path. Any mistake in choosing replacement aircraft could cost months of output because of the effort put into changing factory tooling, the scheduling of resources and the acquisition of labour for the projected new type. Too many aircraft in the programme diluted production effort, made standardization difficult and reduced sharply the gains to be made from long production runs. Too many design changes to aircraft already in production, unless properly organized, could equally cost months of output because of the difficulty in changing tools, jigs and installations to cope with the modifications, as well as producing constant interruptions to the flow of components and uncertainty in long-term production planning. One answer to the problem was to insist as Russian producers did on a rigorous policy of standardization and production continuity. Modifications were incorporated when necessary, particularly to improve engine performance, but models were frozen in production for relatively long periods giving the Soviet air forces large numbers at the cost of a marginally less effective product. The success of the Red Air Force demonstrated that the risk was in this case worth taking. The Soviet Air Force also relied for most of the war on a very small number of aircraft types: two fighters, one fighter bomber, one medium-bomber, two trainers. Such concentration reduced the risk of losing production through too rapid a turnover of aircraft models.731  Page 185 of 309 67% excess of needs.
