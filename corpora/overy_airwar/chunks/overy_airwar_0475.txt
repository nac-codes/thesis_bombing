Milch discovered that over half a ton of aluminium was wasted in the production of each aero-engine.727 The western Allies similarly attempted to concentrate production. But more important than this they concentrated considerable effort on the task of choosing aircraft types in such a way as to keep a balance between production and performance, between quantity and quality. This necessitated introducing as few new types as possible. Despite the constant complaints in both Britain and America over the length of time involved in developing a completely new aircraft type the situation turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Instead most of the aircraft with which the war was fought were modified versions of an original design. In some cases the modification produced effectively a different aircraft. Thus the Lancaster bomber and the Mustang fighter emerged as what appeared to be new aircraft though in fact they had an established pedigree. The essential thing about such modifications was that they should interrupt the production life of aircraft as little as possible.222 In America a system was chosen in which modifications would be accumulated over a period of time introduced in a batch to prevent interruptions to large production runs. In some cases quality suffered. Many argued that the Ford plantâ€™s long delay in producing B-24s in mass-production at Willow Run had rendered the aircraft obsolescent; yet large quantities were produced in 1944 and 1945 to considerable operational effect. For those small modifications that needed to be introduced in the course of a production run special Modification Centres were established where skilled workers  new aircraft though in fact they had an established pedigree.
