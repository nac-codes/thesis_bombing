Italian designers continued to produce a wide range of designs throughout the war and those in charge of the air force and air ministry departments whose task it was to select air force weapons were unequal to the demands made of them. The result was an imbalance in favour of development at the expense of production.735 In Japan the problem of model selection had its root in the division between the army and the navy and in the influence of the services on aircraft production. The first factor resulted in the army and navy producing their own aircraft to perform identical functions and insisting that all development work be kept separate. During the war the navy produced 53 basic models with 112 variations, the army 37 basic models with 52 variations. America, by contrast, concentrated on the production of 18 models for the army and navy together.73© Even when compelled in 1944 to undertake more co-operative aircraft development the navy and army ignored the directives and continued to develop proscribed projects in secret.73” In addition modifications were forced upon industry in a bewildering stream, largely because of the influence of the front-line airmen whose views were regarded as the most important factor in considering changes to aircraft in production. Shortages of engineering and technical staff were so severe that many firms concentrated efforts on the minor alterations and abandoned attempts at more major mark changes. The continuing control over the design and introduction of new models enjoyed by the military, which survived the attempt to control aircraft production through the Ministry of Munitio
