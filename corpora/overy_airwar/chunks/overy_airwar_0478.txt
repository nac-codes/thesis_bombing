r mark changes. The continuing control over the design and introduction of new models enjoyed by the military, which survived the attempt to control aircraft production through the Ministry of Munitions, led to a constant stream of ill-planned and uncertain directives to firms on model changes and priorities which the firms found impossible to cope with.”8 At the aircraft plants so many models were introduced, cancelled then reintroduced or modified that production runs were confined to small numbers only with a resulting poor use of capacity. The firms’ tradition of taking the orders that the military gave them without question meant that Japan lacked the advantage enjoyed in the west of close co-operation between industrial, civilian and military authorities over technical  epee iwi ae ie Ene BR ai re Be tee ed wee Ne te ee ENG oa ie aD ian ce re te ote Da a ee OD ht ee ae Nh ee nee Led ee Bact ote Rf nt Le ate nee eee eh pate bebe pen nee de ote nn  Page 186 of 309 68% new aircraft though in fact they had an established pedigree. The essential thing about such modifications was that they should interrupt the production life of aircraft as little as possible.722 In would introduce the necessary changes immediately before delivery to the air units.723 In Britain the system was more wasteful in terms of quantity but maintained a higher average quality. Major development at the expense of production.”25 In Japan the problem of model selection had its root in the division between the army and the navy and in the influence of the services on aircraft navy produced 53 basic models with 112 variations, the army 37 basic models with 52 variations. America, by contrast, concentrated on the production of 18 models for the army and navy together.73& Even when compelled in 1944 to undertake more co-operative aircraft development the navy and army ignored the directives and continued to develop proscribed projects in secret.737 In addition production questions.
