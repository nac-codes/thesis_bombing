han the loss caused by bombing.743 Instead of building the new models, the Luftwaffe was forced at short notice to begin a programme of modifying established types in order to make up for lost output. But because the decision on modification was taken by the military with little heed of production problems, such modification was a constant source of production delays. The air staff presented the industry in a disorganized way with a stream of minor alterations which they were compelled to incorporate at once and over which the military, including the front-line generals from whom many of the requests for changes came, kept a close scrutiny.7“4 This combination of poor standardization, intensive preoccupation with design and unorganized modification led not only to a loss of quantity but eventually to a loss of quality as well. Only in 1944 with Speer’s insistence on continuous uninterrupted production of a handful of aircraft models was the problem tackled for the first time and by then it was too late.745 In all the Axis powers the common denominator was the exclusive role of the military in choosing designs and ordering modifications without sufficient attention to the economics of aircraft production. Without a coherent production plan the firms responded by producing an unscheduled stream of designs. This satisfied the military demand for better and better weapons in theory only.  In practice the military failed to distinguish the best weapons, and found itself confused by promises from the firms which could not be fulfilled technically.
