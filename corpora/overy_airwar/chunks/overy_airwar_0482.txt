expense of production.725 In Japan the problem of model selection had its root in the division between the army and the navy and in the influence of the services on aircraft navy produced 53 basic models with 112 variations, the army 37 basic models with 52 variations. America, by contrast, concentrated on the production of 18 models for the army and navy together.236 Even when compelled in 1944 to undertake more co-operative aircraft development the navy and army ignored the directives and continued to develop proscribed projects in secret.72” In addition Munitions, led to a constant stream of ill-planned and uncertain directives to firms on model changes and priorities which the firms found impossible to cope with.” At the aircraft plants so many individual firms, and to the secreting of information.”22 Not only did production suffer dramatically through poor control over design and modification, so also did quality. firms’ managers were originally designers. This meant in effect that design and development questions tended to take priority in the firms over production questions.”“1 The entrepreneurs believed it In practice the military failed to distinguish the best weapons, and found itself confused by promises from the firms which could not be fulfilled technically. Insistence on the pursuit of quality at all costs led to short production runs and constant interruptions to the flow of production which demoralized the producers and frustrated the soldiers. (viii) Finance, Capitalism and the War Effort The problem of product selection, like so many in the production of aircraft, was closely related to the extent to which industry was brought into the running of the war economy. That British and American businessmen were integrated into the organization and planning of aircraft production was not simply a reflection of a particular closeness between the governmental and commercial elites but of an anxiety on the part of firms to be involved from the start in ques
