by one means or another, inefficient managers. In Russia, in the absence of any commercial pressure, it was purely managerial efficiency that counted, thus giving more opportunity for promoting able managers. Where elsewhere accidents of ownership or influence affected managerial performance, the whole purpose of Russian management was to manage better. This did not necessarily mean that all the best managers rose to the top, but it did mean that poor managers remained there only briefly. State control over managerial personnel was not in this case a disadvantage since war economics demanded production rather than commercial efficiency.  For the capitalist powers, however, the key question was finance, not efficiency. The precise financial relationship between the firms and the state was of the greatest importance. Since governments were dealing with private firms run by entrepreneurs or on behalf of shareholders, it was impossible to ignore wider financial issues. Moreover, fear of wartime profiteering encouraged governments to formalize relations with industry as early as possible to avoid any problems for production caused by later friction.748 The difficulty was to keep sufficient profit incentive to encourage firms to cut costs and boost production while keeping profits at a level acceptable to public opinion. In the end it was public fear of profiteering that had to be muzzled in order to encourage greater industrial efforts. In Britain the Stamp Survey in June 1940 found ‘patriotism and peril curiously transient as complete substitutes for the old incentives’, and the general criticism of the Excess Profits Tax led in January 1941 to its revision in favour of the firms.”42 The system of finance for war purposes was never satisfactorily worked out. The aircraft industry obtained nearly all its investment for expansion either through government loans or through the direct construction of government-owned installations operated by private firms.
