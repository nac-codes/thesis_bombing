arly all its investment for expansion encouraged the efficient firms to seek out economies where they could in order to widen the profit margins on fixed-price contracts. Investigation of such profit inflation was then left to the taxation authorities. This kind of profit-seeking was tolerated because it had the advantage that it encouraged improvements in productivity which the cost-plus contract did not. It was an avenue to higher profits that satisfied both sides.75° On a firm’s own capital a return of 8 per cent was allowed, which together with incentive allowances for higher turnover and the operation of government-owned assets, left some firms in a position to make almost 20 per cent on capital employed on the firm’s own behalf.751 Some, but by no means all of this, would be subject to Excess Profits Tax. Only those firms working entirely with government facilities received a low rate of return of 1 per cent on contracts, but since much of the early expansion of the aircraft industry had been through private capital there were few firms in this situation.752 By 1944 the growing efficiency of the British firms had indeed led to a widening gap between estimated percentage profit on cost and actual profit.

Ihe resulting loss of output at Messerschmitt, Junkers and Heinkel was considerably greater than the loss caused by bombDing.* directly attributable to managerial error.74” All governments, however, reserved to themselves the right to remove, by one means or another, inefficient managers. In Russia, in the absence of any average had been 4.41 per cent estimate and 6.38 per cent actual. In 1944 the figures were 2.88 and 5.74.753 Excess Profits Tax was used to cope with the anomaly but retrospective penalties were hard to calculate. The biggest advantage was not, however, to do with profits. Most firms emerged with vastly expanded assets at the end of the war, many
