the anomaly but retrospective penalties were hard to calculate. The biggest advantage was not, however, to do with profits. Most firms emerged with vastly expanded assets at the end of the war, many in a position to buy out the government-owned facilities at generous prices. It also gave encouragement to the process of concentration and eliminated lesser competitors for future peace-time commercial contests; and all largely at government expense.754  The same uncertainty in relations between business and government prevailed in the United States. Firms were reluctant to undertake aircraft work until the conditions of finance were altered. Many outside firms, particularly in the car industry, refused to take up war orders in 1940 and 1941 unless the state provided all the funds for expansion, or unless all private firms in a particular sector were compelled to take war contracts.755 Such resistance was fed by the fact that the firms were experiencing a rising consumer boom for the first time since the Great Crash and were not willing to sacrifice the increase in profits. The question of contracts even in the aircraft industry was equally thorny. The Vinson-Trammell Act of 1934 had restricted profits to 10 per cent on contracts which, industry with the result that it was not always easy for firms to introduce modern methods or reorganize production scale through lack of managerial experience.”“6 This problem was particularly January 1941 toits revision in favour of the firms.”4° The system of finance for war purposes was never satisfactorily worked out. The aircraft industry obtained nearly all its investment for expansion profits that satisfied both sides.7©° On a firm’s own capital a return of 8 per cent was allowed, which together with incentive allowances for higher turnover and the operation of government-owned assets, left some firms in a position to make almost 20 per cent on capital employed on the firm’s own behalf.75!
