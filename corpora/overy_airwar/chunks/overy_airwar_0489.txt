had the advantage of enormously expanded assets at relatively low cost in a sector which had traditionally found difficulty in raising capital.7©° In both Britain and America the commercial interests of capitalism were respected. In both cases a high degree of co- operation and integration was achieved. In both cases there existed substantial incentives to improving production through financial reward; and most important of all the risk was undertaken by the state while the operating profit was taken by private industry.  Capitalism was recruited in Japan and Germany much more slowly and with considerable political conflict. Over the mobilization period in Japan the military attempted to control Zaibatsu financial policies, particularly through profit and dividend control designed to keep more money in the firms for reinvestment in war industry. The problem here was not profit as such, for the large holding companies continued to make substantial profits until 1944 and profitable operations could be used to subsidize those such as aircraft production where the risks were greater. It was much morea question of the relationship between the military and the capitalist elite.7©! Until 1943 the integration of business into the war-economic organization was much less than in the west. Only in 1943 January 1941 to its revision in favour of the firms.”42 The system of finance for war purposes was never satisfactorily worked out. The aircraft industry obtained nearly all its investment for expansion profits that satisfied both sides.7=° On a firm’s own capital a return of 8 per cent was allowed, which together with incentive allowances for higher turnover and the operation of government-owned as in Britain, were negotiated at a fixed price. In 1939 the level was raised to 12 per cent. The efforts of Congress in 1940 to reduce it to 8 per cent were strongly resisted,75° and were accepted only in calculate profit rates on the basis of facilities that they had not built and di
