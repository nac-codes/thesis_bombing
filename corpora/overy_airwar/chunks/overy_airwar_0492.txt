Much of the profit that was enjoyed by private firms in the west went back into Reich funds in Germany, and all expansion during the war in large production facilities was concentrated in the state-run sector at Goering’s request.7©5 Even after the Speer reforms there still existed in the aircraft industry a distrust of the state, and of the air ministry leadership in particular, reflecting the more general divorce between military and civilian life that was common to the Axis services. Severe bomb damage, coupled with long negotiations over compensation, and Hitler’s demand for the destruction of industrial installations, although unfulfilled, created yet further economic and political difficulties for private aircraft manufacturers. During the critical early years of war when a fusion of capitalist and political elites was completed in the west, the Axis powers paid the penalty for rapid economic and technical advance within a more traditionalist political structure. Aircraft production was vital to the waging of air warfare. This fact was demonstrated throughout the conflict from 1939 to 1945. That the economic potential of those countries that became allies against the fascist powers was very considerably greater than those of their enemies was also clear. It is much more difficult to explain why the Axis powers failed to mobilize productive resources as efficiently or as fully as their economic resources would allow or to the same extent as the Allied powers. The Allies’ industrial and organizational problems were often as great, and in the case of the Soviet Union even greater.
