ce so that strength and aeronautical researchers, though more developed in some countries than in others, were forged everywhere.”®7 In Germany and Britain in particular the pace of air research and the degree of co- operation between science and the air force had both increased substantially during the course of the 1930s. The Tizard Committee for Air Defence established in 1934 made considerable strides in linking together soldiers, government scientists, administrators and the university scientific staff for air research and development in the period before 1939.768 In Germany large-scale air research for military purposes was established for the first time by the new Luftwaffe, which was thus compelled to make use of scientific resources in the firms and universities, although it retained greater military control over air research than in Britain.76* Despite the recognition well before 1939 of the major role science would play in any future war involving air power, the most important step was to procure as much scientific effort for war as possible once hostilities had actually begun, and in this endeavour there emerged obvious contrasts. Although the British scientific establishment was smaller and less well-funded than its German equivalent it was recruited much more energetically for war. By 1939 a list of 5,000 leading scientists and engineers had been prepared for mobilization for war work in particular fields. On the outbreak of war those with scientific training were given reserved occupational status to avoid conscription of young scientists.
