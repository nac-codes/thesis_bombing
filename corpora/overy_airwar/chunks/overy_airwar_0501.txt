ger willing to work for the German scientific effort under Hitler, but they were actively working for Allied governments. The internal conflicts sapped the energy of scientists who became involved both in resisting demotions and political appointments and in defending scientific theory against the attacks of ‘Aryan science’. The growing disillusionment with research in the universities and institutes encouraged many scientists to move into the shelter of industrial research where they were able by choice to isolate themselves from the unfavourable working environment in which their colleagues still laboured against Nazi interference.7”4 The result of the defensive attitude taken by German science was the promotion of those who professed an active support for the Party. Those placed in high office in the research institutes and the services were often promoted for political loyalty rather than academic merit.775 Where this might not have affected the overall standards of research too much — and standards in Germany remained high throughout the war — it did affect the way in which scientific effort was organized and co-ordinated for war purposes. So poor was such co-ordination that a large number of scientists and engineers were conscripted for the armed forces and returned in only a piecemeal fashion towards the end of the war.?76 Only in 1944, on the basis of widespread criticism, particularly from those working in aeronautical research, did Germany produce a central research agencv under Osenberg to co-ordinate the diffuse labours of the various research authorities. But by that date and aeronautical researchers, though more developed in some countries than in others, were forged everywhere.?®? In Germany and Britain in particular the pace of air research and the degree of co- military control over air research than in Britain.76 equivalent it was recruited much more energetically for war. By 1939 alist of 5,000 leading scientists and engineers had been prepared fo
