e of co- military control over air research than in Britain.76 equivalent it was recruited much more energetically for war. By 1939 alist of 5,000 leading scientists and engineers had been prepared for mobilization for war work in particular fields. On the adviser, Churchill remained committed over the war years to involving science as fully as possible, and to help it escape from ‘the prejudice of any one particular uniformed profession’.271 The RAF scientists and engineers were conscripted for the armed forces and returned in only a piecemeal fashion towards the end of the war.776 Only in 1944, on the basis of widespread criticism, particularly from those working in aeronautical research, did Germany produce a central research agency under Osenberg to co-ordinate the diffuse labours of the various research authorities. But by that date reform came far too late and largely in response to Hitler’s demands for miracle weapons, echoed by Goering. The Reichsforschungsrat, the leading research authority directly under Goering, had 800 projects on hand in 1944 of which 70 per cent were in agriculture and forestry and only 3 per cent in physics.?”” From such a small and politically dominated base it was impossible to fulfil the demand made forcefully at the Academy for Aeronautical Research in 1943 ‘to utilize the full potentialities of universities and engineering schools’.778 The United States had a scientific tradition that was much more German in the sense that considerable effort had been devoted before 1939 to promoting widespread and well-funded research directed towards industry and the interests of pure science. But the United States also paralleled British initiatives in organizing science on a national scale and adapting that organization to the requirements of the armed forces. The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, founded during the First World War, acted as a springboard for the recruitment of science from industry and the universities. Its chairm
