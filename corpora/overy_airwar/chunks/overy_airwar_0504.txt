centres and laboratories not directly controlled by the services were staffed with service liaison officers who were able to report requirements to the scientists and report back successes directly to the commanders.”£° A reciprocal arrangement operated with the forces at the front. In the air force in particular scientists and engineers were invited to the front in large numbers to observe weapons under combat conditions and to discuss with officers with combat experience tactical innovations that relied on science. This led in Britain to the introduction of Operational Research (OR), in which the scientists came to be involved closely in actual strategic and tactical decision-making on the basis of applying scientific statistical and analytical methods to operations.7®! This proved to be particularly vital for air warfare. OR was concentrated in the bombing war, with its demands for predictive analysis of the cost of operations as well as scientific analysis of results; and in radar work, particularly in anti-aircraft tactics and the Battle of the Atlantic.
