ded the same service for the army and navy air forces.783 Such close contact, even in areas traditionally reserved for the military establishment, repeated the situation in economics and in administration in which the American and British air forces were compelled to work within a strategic framework decided by civilians and soldiers together.  The reluctance of the Axis air forces to be subjected to control by civilians, or to be forced to co-operate with them was repeated in relations between science and the military in Germany and Japan. In Japan the military control over research was extensive and was fuelled to a considerable extent by rivalry between the army and navy, both of which built up separate research establishments whose secrets were jealously guarded. The Japanese military authorities distrusted many of those scientists with a western education and recruited far less widely from the universities than in the west.784 There was thus little co-ordination of effort. So exaggerated did the secretiveness and rivalry become that both navy and army produced separate radar aids to the identification of friendly aircraft and were unable to distinguish each other’s aircraft from those of the enemy.785 In Germany the military similarly controlled large areas of research. For the Luftwaffe facilities were provided on the most generous scale under the protection of Goering who gradually drew all research in Germany under his loose jurisdiction.78¢ On military matters the scientists were largely excluded. Certainly no operational research on the scale practised by the Allies was developed, nor were scientists allowed to sit on staff committees and contribute to tactical and strategic decisions. Engineers and scientists were discouraged from visiting the front and were not usually allowed to witness the testing of weapons on which they had worked, nor to match tactical experience with personal research programmes. Moreover the military preoccupation with protocol le
