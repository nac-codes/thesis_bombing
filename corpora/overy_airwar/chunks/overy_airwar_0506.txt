Moreover the military preoccupation with protocol led to the conscription of scientists for war work without military rank which automatically excluded them from the military decision-making process and made them subordinate to full officers.787 The alternative recourse for scientists of appealing to the political over the military authority was not available in the Luftwaffe since the two authorities were the same.

Those placed in high office in the research institutes and the services were often promoted for political loyalty rather than academic merit.77> Where this might not have affected the overall standards of research too much — and standards in scientists and engineers were conscripted for the armed forces and returned in only a piecemeal fashion towards the end of the war.?76 Only in 1944, on the basis of widespread criticism, particularly requirements to the scientists and report back successes directly to the commanders.”° A reciprocal arrangement operated with the forces at the front. In the air force in particular scientists and aircraft and were unable to distinguish each other’s aircraft from those of the enemy.7®5 In Germany the military similarly controlled large areas of research. For the Luftwaffe facilities were provided on the most generous scale under the protection of Goering who gradually drew all research in Germany under his loose jurisdiction.78* On military matters the scientists were largely excluded.
