on of Goering who gradually drew all research in Germany under his loose jurisdiction.78* On military matters the scientists were largely excluded. In the western democracies scientific and military elites were able to reach mutual decisions as co-equals. In Germany science was the servant of the armed forces. If the Luftwaffe willingly exploited science, it did so only to the extent that the Luftwaffe staff believed desirable, thus reducing the intellectual resources for sound technical judgement to the research sub-section of the Air Ministry Technical Office. The extreme compartmentalization of function that denied scientists access to the working of the war itself, explained the apparent paradox of a country rich in research resources but unable to exploit the advantages that such riches bestowed. Nor was the Luftwaffe able to make up for the deficiencies of scientific organization by using industrial research facilities to the full, although most of the important and pioneering work on aircraft was undertaken at the firm institutes.788 Here the problem was an unregulated flood of research from firms, anxious to promote their own designs at the expense of those of their rivals, competing for the attention of military technicians in the air ministry who were unequal to the task of sorting the necessary from the unnecessary research. The response of the military authorities, whose scientific competence was far below that of the industrial researchers they controlled, was to fluctuate between widespread proscription of all research in favour of immediate development and production targets, and the indiscriminate support of all projects in the hope that one might turn out to be a war-winning wraannn 789  Page 196 of 309 72% Compton, the director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, became the spokesman of science at a political level.?”° Roosevelt, like Churchill, did not need to be persuaded of the significance requirements to the scientists and report bac
