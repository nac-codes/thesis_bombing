titute of Technology, became the spokesman of science at a political level.?”° Roosevelt, like Churchill, did not need to be persuaded of the significance requirements to the scientists and report back successes directly to the commanders.78° A reciprocal arrangement operated with the forces at the front. In the air force in particular scientists and west.284 There was thus little co-ordination of effort. So exaggerated did the secretiveness and rivalry become that both navy and army produced separate radar aids to the identification of friendly on the most generous scale under the protection of Goering who gradually drew all research in Germany under his loose jurisdiction.786 On military matters the scientists were largely excluded. military decision-making process and made them subordinate to full officers.78? The alternative recourse for scientists of appealing to the political over the military authority was not available in the weapon.782 The experience of research in Germany, where large resources were diverted to science, emphasized the importance of organization in the mobilization of scientific efforts. For science there were particular organizational problems. The utilization of science for the war effort required a high degree of co-operation since much of the necessary research was co-operative in nature. Secondly science required, paradoxically, great operational freedom and close project supervision at the same time.?%° The first point was made obvious through relations between science, the air forces and industry. In jet research for example too much service control in Britain and too much industrial freedom in Germany postponed the emergence of a satisfactory jet aircraft. Though years behind in jet research, the American co-operative effort between air force, academic and industrial research produced a jet aircraft in a considerably shorter time than the European pioneers. In the west a high level of co-operation was the result of a greater degree
