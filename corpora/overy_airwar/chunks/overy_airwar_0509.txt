force, academic and industrial research produced a jet aircraft in a considerably shorter time than the European pioneers. In the west a high level of co-operation was the result of a greater degree of homogeneity in professional life. Although there were numerous conflicts of scientific opinion, scientists, managers and soldiers co-operated freely as equals in reaching technical decisions. In Japan and Germany even where a willingness to co-operate existed professional or social exclusiveness often placed barriers in the way. _ — ne ne ra a an EE aircraft and were unable to distinguish each other’s aircraft from those of the enemy.785 In Germany the military similarly controlled large areas of research. For the Luftwaffe facilities were provided on the most generous scale under the protection of Goering who gradually drew all research in Germany under his loose jurisdiction.78° On military matters the scientists were largely excluded. military decision-making process and made them subordinate to full officers.78” The alternative recourse for scientists of appealing to the political over the military authority was not available in the science required, paradoxically, great operational freedom and close project supervision at the same time.”2° The first point was made obvious through relations between science, the air forces and Co-operation in science itself, as distinct from organizational co-operation, was even more important. In order to advance as rapidly as possible on a broad technological front it was necessary not only to have access to the work and results of other native scientists but to be able to tap sources of discovery abroad. Before the outbreak of war aeronautics was an international discipline. Speed, height and range records passed rapidly from country to country as the common stock of knowledge was refined or advanced through particular breakthroughs.7%! In aero-engine design in particular the achievements of British and American engineers were
