ry to country as the common stock of knowledge was refined or advanced through particular breakthroughs.7%! In aero-engine design in particular the achievements of British and American engineers were widely imitated. In high-speed aircraft design German and Italian designers remained in the forefront, until their ideas became common currency. Japan and Russia drew fully on American and German design experience; Germany and Russia collaborated on aircraft work during the 1920s; the ‘secret’ Luftwaffe acquired crucial supplies from Britain and the United States in the early years of concealed expansion.”*? Although the major industrial powers were all capable on their own of making substantial advances in air technology, the speed with which such technology changed in the 1930s was a reflection of a pooling of theory and experimentation.  On the outbreak of war international scientific co-operation broke down. Although it was possible to copy captured technology, the Axis powers were thrown back upon their own resources. For Japan, whose aircraft industry was based very largely on imitation, it made it very difficult to reduce what was in effect a considerable technical gap between native and western air technology.793 Nor was there any effective co-operation between the fascist allies. Germany refused to pass over to the Japanese or Italians the advanced weapons technology that the latter lacked. Only in the face of  science required, paradoxically, great operational freedom and close project supervision at the same time.” The first point was made obvious through relations between science, the air forces and from Britain and the United States in the early years of concealed expansion.?22 Although the major industrial powers were all capable on their own of making substantial advances in air technology, Japan, whose aircraft industry was based very largely on imitation, it made it very difficult to reduce what was in effect a considerable technical gap between native
