tial advances in air technology, Japan, whose aircraft industry was based very largely on imitation, it made it very difficult to reduce what was in effect a considerable technical gap between native and western air technology.223 imminent defeat did Germany dispatch blueprints on the best weapons, including jet research, to the Japanese who were unable in the short time demanded to make use of them.224 Germany, too, was cut off from the scientific world abroad. Many of the research facilities of Europe were removed by scientists fleeing to Britain or America in the face of invasion. German technical espionage abroad was ineffective. In sharp contrast the degree of co-operation agreed between the Allies was very much greater. For Russia this was of particular significance. Since the Soviet aircraft industry was considerably behind the technical level achieved in Britain and America, the onset of Lend-Lease, which involved advanced war material as well as scientific and technical advice, drew Russia closer to the threshold of aircraft technology.?Â°> Despite the political difficulties involved a wealth of secret information was passed between Britain and the United States in every area of air technology. This meant in effect that the Allies were able to draw on the intellectual scientific resources of most of the non-fascist world, including the scientists who had fled from Europe.726 Moreover resistance to German occupation, or to Nazism in Germany itself caused a considerable amount of scientific intelligence to pass into Allied hands. Such intelligence confirmed that the Allies had indeed established a broad technical lead through the widespread application of science to war.727 Under such circumstances Germany was unable to compete. The technical lead enjoyed by the German air force before 1939 could not be maintained; not just because it was squandered, but because German scientists were forced to work from a much narrower research base than the Allies.
