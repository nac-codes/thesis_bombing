erman air force before 1939 could not be maintained; not just because it was squandered, but because German scientists were forced to work from a much narrower research base than the Allies. The second organizational requirement, for operational flexibility combined with close supervision of research and development, was a need necessary both to science itself and to the effective organization of science for war. Science relied on being given the maximum freedom in formulating the problems to be solved and producing the appropriate experimental and research conditions for solving them. Scientific advance could not be carried out to order, particularly military order, for where airmen tended to see weapons technology as fixed at any one time, it was the scientists’ task to ensure that it was not.?28 In very few instances did airmen fail to grasp the importance of giving researchers the freedom to undertake pure research without military interference. But there also existed dangers in allowing scientists too much freedom. While fundamental theoretical research was very necessary, it was essential to maintain a balance between general research and the specific requirements of war. One danger was the duplication of effort. Only a central control over research could prevent a number of different centres from working separately on the same object.
