did Germany dispatch blueprints on the best weapons, including jet research, to the Japanese who were unable in the short time demanded to make use of them.?94 Germany, too, was the threshold of aircraft technology.?*> Despite the political difficulties involved a wealth of secret information was passed between Britain and the United States in every area of air technology. This meant in effect that the Allies were able to draw on the intellectual scientific resources of most of the non-fascist world, including the scientists who had fled from Europe.72° Moreover resistance to a broad technical lead through the widespread application of science to war.”27 Under such circumstances Germany was unable to compete. The technical lead enjoyed by the German air force before task to ensure that it was not.?%8 In very few instances did airmen fail to grasp the importance of giving researchers the freedom to undertake pure research without military interference. But there Japan and Germany the general lack of co-ordinated central direction coupled with the failure to adequately break down barriers between the researchers and the services, led to a situation in which the same research was being carried out in air force establishments, universities and firms, in many cases unknown to each other.7°2 Another danger lay in the encouragement of too much long-term research, in which many scientists were more interested, at the expense of the short-term military need. To avoid both these dangers the answer was to create a satisfactory selection procedure and adequate development facilities in order to extract as much as possible from the research effort in terms of current needs and future prospects.
