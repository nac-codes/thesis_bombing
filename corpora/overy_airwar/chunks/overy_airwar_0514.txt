In aero-engine design in particular Japan, whose aircraft industry was based very largely on imitation, it made it very difficult to reduce what was in effect a considerable technical gap between native and western air technology.?%3 imminent defeat did Germany dispatch blueprints on the best weapons, including jet research, to the Japanese who were unable in the short time demanded to make use of them.7%4 Germany, too, was the threshold of aircraft technology.”°> Despite the political difficulties involved a wealth of secret information was passed between Britain and the United States in every area of air technology. This meant in effect that the Allies were able to draw on the intellectual scientific resources of most of the non-fascist world, including the scientists who had fled from Europe.726 Moreover resistance to a broad technical lead through the widespread application of science to war.”2? Under such circumstances Germany was unable to compete. The technical lead enjoyed by the German air force before the same research was being carried out in air force establishments, universities and firms, in many cases unknown to each other.722 Another danger lay in the encouragement of too much long-term The quality of weapons depended not only on the available technology but on the way in which weapons were developed, tested and chosen. The selection procedure was a crucial factor governing the use of science. There we
