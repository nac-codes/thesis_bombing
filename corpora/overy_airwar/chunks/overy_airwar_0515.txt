ons depended not only on the available technology but on the way in which weapons were developed, tested and chosen. The selection procedure was a crucial factor governing the use of science. There were a number of determinants. Strategy itself affected questions of quality. In Germany, for example, the belief in a short war in both 1940 and again in 1941 led to development stoppages in order to concentrate all efforts on the production and engineering problems of immediate usefulness.®°° On the Allied side a resolute acceptance of a large-scale bombing capability led to an emphasis on bombing technology and large aircraft development. A second determinant was knowledge of what the enemy was doing. In Britain and the United States it was assumed from the outset that German science would be equal to the achievements in the west and that there were few ‘safe’ areas of research in which it could be expected that neither side would concentrate its efforts. By contrast the German military leadership considered that in a number of important fields Germany had a measurable lead — including radar and nuclear research — and that the effort in those areas could be relaxed in favour of areas where there was less confidence of superiority.2% Finally, quality was influenced by particular scientific and engineering traditions. Where Japan, whose aircraft industry was based very largely on imitation, it made it very difficult to reduce what was in effect a considerable technical gap between native and western air technology.793 imminent defeat did Germany dispatch blueprints on the best weapons, including jet research, to the Japanese who were unable in the short time demanded to make use of them.724 Germany, too, was the threshold of aircraft technology.795 Despite the political difficulties involved a wealth of secret information was passed between Britain and the United States in every area of air technology. This meant in effect that the Allies were able to draw on the intelle
