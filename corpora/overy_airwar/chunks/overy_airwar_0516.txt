iculties involved a wealth of secret information was passed between Britain and the United States in every area of air technology. This meant in effect that the Allies were able to draw on the intellectual scientific resources of most of the non-fascist world, including the scientists who had fled from Europe.?°° Moreover resistance to a broad technical lead through the widespread application of science to war.?2? Under such circumstances Germany was unable to compete. The technical lead enjoyed by the German air force before task to ensure that it was not.?°8 In very few instances did airmen fail to grasp the importance of giving researchers the freedom to undertake pure research without military interference. But there development stoppages in order to concentrate all efforts on the production and engineering problems of immediate usefulness.8°° On the Allied side a resolute acceptance of a large-scale bombing the effort in those areas could be relaxed in favour of areas where there was less confidence of superiority.®°! Finally, quality was influenced by particular scientific and engineering traditions. Where there was a greater emphasis on pure research, as in the USSR and Germany, the onus was placed on the engineering staffs to turn the theory into workable weapons; where the tradition was more empirical, as in Britain and America, workable devices were produced even in advance of the theory. The cavity magnetron, which made possible the creation of centimetric radar, was constructed with a great deal of laboratory improvisation but why it worked was not fully understood until later in the war.°2 In war this distinction between inventive and innovatory traditions, between pure and applied research, was very important. Where German scientists knew of the possibilities they lacked the facilities to experiment, or in many cases regarded experimentation as a less prestigious occupation fit to be left to the service engineers. Yet it was the ability to turn scienti
