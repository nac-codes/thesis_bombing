ished the usual priority for research and development projects.8°° The German development stoppages of 1940 and 1941 differed from those of the Allies. They were not in order to meet an urgent need, but precisely because such a need was lacking.

Where with a great deal of laboratory improvisation but why it worked was not fully understood until later in the war.®°2 In war this distinction between inventive and innovatory traditions, between pure on qualitative improvement.®° To some extent the same decision was reached in Britain and America in the early stages of war. In 1940 current needs were emphasized by Beaverbrook at MAP at the expense of future developments. Efforts were concentrated on five ‘preferred types’ and development cut back to cover only the most urgent projects.8©4 In the United States the call to expand aircraft to... defer our present research and development’.2° In both cases the deferment was a temporary response to the strategic situation. As soon as it became feasible both the RAF and the AAF returned experimentation’ in overruling Arnold’s earlier directives. By the spring of 1941 MAP restored suspended projects and re-established the usual priority for research and development projects.8% The war would be won with
