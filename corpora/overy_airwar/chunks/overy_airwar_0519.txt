overruling Arnold’s earlier directives. By the spring of 1941 MAP restored suspended projects and re-established the usual priority for research and development projects.8% The war would be won with the weapons in hand Hitler ordered a restriction on any development work that would not be of immediate use including radar and jet aircraft. The restrictions were also designed to restrain the aircraft firms from undertaking too much unscheduled research at the expense of production, although its effect was to encourage such work to continue in secret.8°? The problem in Germany was that there existed no satisfactory alternative once the development ban was lifted again. The selection process in the Luftwaffe was weakened by a number of factors. The first was the complex problem of timetabling. The difficulty in gauging how long a new design took to develop was common to all air forces. In the Luftwaffe neither Udet nor Goering, who were responsible for such decisions, understood either the pace of technological change, or the importance of long-term technical planning. Udet persistently postponed taking what he regarded as difficult political and technical decisions on replacement technology and finally committed suicide in 1941 at the time when it had become obvious that in almost every field the planned replacement had not been properly developed.8°8 Hitler and Goering had an equally optimistic view on the length of time involved in the development of air weapons. Moreover in his anxiety to retain Hitler’s favour, Goering promised new weapons well in advance of their actual development time and then tried to speed up the timetable to the point of undermining the project altogether.8°2 To some extent this was a result of Hitler’s own search for secret or ‘wonder’ weapons and his way of dealing with those researchers whom he regarded as malingerers. This encouraged the random selection of projects that appealed to Hitler’s weapons mentality. It discouraged other resear
