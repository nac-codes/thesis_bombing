and his way of dealing with those researchers whom he regarded as malingerers. This encouraged the random selection of projects that appealed to Hitler’s weapons mentality. It discouraged other researchers from making known novel weapons research in case Hitler should take up their cause and berate them for subsequent delays or promises unfulfilled.2!© This was true for the German aircraft firms as well. In efforts to get contracts and find favour with Goering, performances were promised and schedules agreed that often bore little relation to reality while Goering lacked the technical competence or a satisfactory selection organization for seeing this in advance.®!! In the end it was an industrial engineer, Robert Lusser from Heinkel, who, in a widely publicized report in 1942 explained to the RLM that the development work on all aircraft types took at least five years and sometimes longer, and that efforts to speed the process up only led to greater difficulties at the production stage and in operations.8!2 Only in 1942, under the guidance of Milch, did the Luftwaffe finally acknowledge that it was not possible to introduce any new aircraft types that would substantially improve current performance until 1945 or 1946. Another problem with the Luftwaffe selection process was the lack of effective supervision over research designed to bridge the gap between pure and applied traditions. There was too little emphasis on actual development and testing, and too small and unskilled a technical workforce in the ministry to decide on what research could be satisfactorily turned into end products and what development stoppages in order to concentrate all efforts on the production and engineering problems of immediate usefulness.8©° On the Allied side a resolute acceptance of a large-scale bombing the effort in those areas could be relaxed in favour of areas where there was less confidence of superiority.2 Finally, quality was influenced by particular scientific and engineeri
