arge-scale bombing the effort in those areas could be relaxed in favour of areas where there was less confidence of superiority.2 Finally, quality was influenced by particular scientific and engineering traditions. Where with a great deal of laboratory improvisation but why it worked was not fully understood until later in the war.8°2 In war this distinction between inventive and innovatory traditions, between pure to... defer our present research and development’.8° In both cases the deferment was a temporary response to the strategic situation. As soon as it became feasible both the RAF and the AAF returned experimentation’ in overruling Arnold’s earlier directives. By the spring of 1941 MAP restored suspended projects and re-established the usual priority for research and development projects.£ The designed to restrain the aircraft firms from undertaking too much unscheduled research at the expense of production, although its effect was to encourage such work to continue in secret.89? The when it had become obvious that in almost every field the planned replacement had not been properly developed.®°8 Hitler and Goering had an equally optimistic view on the length of time involved timetable to the point of undermining the project altogether.8°° To some extent this was a result of Hitler’s own search for secret or ‘wonder’ weapons and his way of dealing with those researchers research in case Hitler should take up their cause and berate them for subsequent delays or promises unfulfilled.£1° This was true for the German aircraft firms as well. In efforts to get contracts and could not. Had the selection process been more co-ordinated with civilian experts and brought to the highest administrative levels in a well-organized way Germany might well have possessed a range of jet-powered aircraft considerably superior in performance to Allied aircraft by 1942-43.  In America and Britain great emphasis was given to turning research into weapons quickly. This was often at
