f jet-powered aircraft considerably superior in performance to Allied aircraft by 1942-43.  In America and Britain great emphasis was given to turning research into weapons quickly. This was often at the expense of pure or long-term research as the American experience with jet aircraft demonstrated. The establishment by the War Department of the New Developments Division in 1943 was intended to restore the balance between pure and applied weapons research.813 The selection process in both Britain and America was closely supervised by a wide range of competent military and academic committees. In the British case development was carried on through the closest co-operation between researchers and airmen. At the Telecommunications Research Establishment almost all the projects were turned into operational products because those that would clearly produce no useful results were rejected before research time was wasted on them.®!4 Under such circumstances some lines of research were sacrificed that had a future significance, but against  euinh Aisademntacns anuld ha laid tha fant af tha alana an avdinatian and ounactrisian af eaanasch fav annlinntian ta antininatad ais favan nanda On tha aunctian af timatahlina daualanmant MAD tank a with a great deal of laboratory improvisation but why it worked was not fully understood until later in the war.®° In war this distinction between inventive and innovatory traditions, between pure on qualitative improvement.®°3 To some extent the same decision was reached in Britain and America in the early stages of war. In 1940 current needs were emphasized by Beaverbrook at MAP at the expense of future developments. Efforts were concentrated on five ‘preferred types’ and development cut back to cover only the most urgent projects.8 In the United States the call to expand aircraft designed to restrain the aircraft firms from undertaking too much unscheduled research at the expense of production, although its effect was to encourage such wo
