ted States the call to expand aircraft designed to restrain the aircraft firms from undertaking too much unscheduled research at the expense of production, although its effect was to encourage such work to continue in secret.8°” The research in case Hitler should take up their cause and berate them for subsequent delays or promises unfulfilled.!© This was true for the German aircraft firms as well. In efforts to get contracts and work on all aircraft types took at least five years and sometimes longer, and that efforts to speed the process up only led to greater difficulties at the production stage and in operations.®!2 Only in 1942, demonstrated. The establishment by the War Department of the New Developments Division in 1943 was intended to restore the balance between pure and applied weapons research.8!3 The selection produce no useful results were rejected before research time was wasted on them.8!4 Under such circumstances some lines of research were sacrificed that had a future significance, but against such disadvantages could be laid the fact of the close co-ordination and supervision of research for application to anticipated air force needs. On the question of timetabling development MAP took a conservative position. On the assumption that small aircraft took over five years to develop, and large aircraft eight years it was seen from the outset that very few new aircraft could be developed for the war in hand.®45 Only the Mosquito bomber disproved the contention that new aircraft would take time to develop and that it was better under such circumstances to encourage the improvement of existing types.®16 The same decision was reached in the United States. Modification was preferred to invention as it promised faster results. That such a decision should be taken also reflected an important point about the particular technical threshold at which aeronautics had arrived. By the end of the 1930s it was apparent that the piston-engined monoplane was nearing the
