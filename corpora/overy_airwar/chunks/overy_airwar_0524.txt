also reflected an important point about the particular technical threshold at which aeronautics had arrived. By the end of the 1930s it was apparent that the piston-engined monoplane was nearing the end of its technical development. All the advanced economic and technical powers were approaching this end at rates that differed only by small margins. There only remained improvements to be made in engine capacity, metallurgy, radio equipment, navigation aids and armament.

In the end it was an industrial engineer, Robert Lusser from Heinkel, who, in a widely publicized report in 1942 explained to the RLM that the development work on all aircraft types took at least five years and sometimes longer, and that efforts to speed the process up only led to greater difficulties at the production stage and in operations.8!2 Only in 1942, the war in hand.845 Only the Mosquito bomber disproved the contention that new aircraft would take time to develop and that it was better under such circumstances to encourage the improvement of existing types.816 The same decision was reached in the United States. Modification was preferred to invention as it promised faster results. That such a decision should be taken also reflected an in these areas that the policy of modification to improve quality was implemented, first by the Allies and then, with great haste, by Germany.®!” The only possibility of a radical departure in aircraft
