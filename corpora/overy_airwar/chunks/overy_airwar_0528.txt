pment in Germany. The RLM showed little enthusiasm for the project which was not expected to yield results within the span of the current war. Yet when Hitler discovered the potential of the project he assumed a personal responsibility for it to ensure that there would be no more delays. His policy of speeding up the development programme and of unaer the guidance of Mich, dia the Luttwatte finally acknowied¢ge that 1t was not possible to introauce any new alrcralit types that would substantially limprove current performance unth 1745 OF produce no useful results were rejected before research time was wasted on them.®!4 Under such circumstances some lines of research were sacrificed that had a future significance, but against the war in hand.815 Only the Mosquito bomber disproved the contention that new aircraft would take time to develop and that it was better under such circumstances to encourage the improvement in these areas that the policy of modification to improve quality was implemented, first by the Allies and then, with great haste, by Germany.®!2 The only possibility of a radical departure in aircraft heavy bomber. He calculated that the rocket Hitler required, capable of carrying a ten-ton warhead, would take a further five years of research and a rocket fuel which had not yet been developed.820 penalizing those who stood in the way of innovation had the opposite effect to the one he wanted, bringing into service aircraft that were insufficiently developed while demoralizing those whose research abilities were needed to complete development.821 There were similar misjudgements on the Allies’ side. Yet the massing of research and development at the critical areas within a selection process that was responsible for sorting the strategically desirable from all that was theoretically possible, produced sufficient technological momentum to produce a balance between the development of current types and the production of novel weapons.
