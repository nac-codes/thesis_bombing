ot have a sufficient strategic return for the research effort involved except in the case of aircraft mounted rocket armament.®26 The lead taken by German long-range rocket research was thus of little strategic value and leads which might have existed elsewhere were squandered through poor strategic appreciation. In Japan there was also evidence of poor project selection, although the problem for Japan was a general backwardness in research which it was difficult to make up during the war under conditions of isolation. The lack of a satisfactory evaluative machinery led for example to the diversion of considerable resources to the search for a ‘death ray’; a search that western powers had abandoned in the 1930s. By the end of the war the Japanese ‘ray’ could kill a rabbit after five minutes at a distance of 1,000 yards.827 Even without such self- inflicted waste of resources, there had been little chance that the Axis powers would be able to produce or use the secret weapons popularly feared in the west. Instead massive scientific mobilization, combined with a close alliance between military and scientific elites, gave the Allies the opportunity for eroding what technical gaps still existed between the sides in 1939 and of extending those technical leads already enjoyed.
