a _ ae ee the scientific and military establishment were generally agreed that German research was x of such weapons being produced by the enemy during the war either.8!2 But with rocket and pilotless aircraft technology Hitler and Goering found a weapon of such apparent novelty and with great terroristic potential that it was given the heavy bomber. He calculated that the rocket Hitler required, capable of carrying a ten-ton warhead, would take a further five years of research and a rocket fuel which had not yet been developed.822  rr Page 203 of 309 75% SATE WISI LL Wad LEAMA LIAL JEL ALLL GLE LISI UE MOR LUW eal Uo LLIe C1 UE A Weld LUE E WWAILEE LLISL WISE RULIVEEILLULIAL ALL WRAPS.

The Second World War saw a rapid increase in the pace of technical change. The German V-2 rocket heralded the missile age, though its impact was far less than Hitler had hoped. Imperial War Museum Page 204 of 309 75% (iii) Intelligence and the Air War  Science also had a major contribution to make to the whole area of air intelligence. This contribution increased in importance as the war progressed when air forces explored the war effort for resources to help in their own intelligence work. Air intelligence consisted of a number of very distinct areas. On the one hand the collection of information about enemy air forces; on the other intelligence efforts to improve air force operational efficiency through operational research and the application of scientific intelligence to navigation signals and radar. Aircraft were also used for intelligence work for the armed forces as a whole, particularly in photo-reconnaissance work.  The ordinary work of air intelligence required little elaborate organization until it became necessary to know more about the advanced weapons being produced on either side. It was
