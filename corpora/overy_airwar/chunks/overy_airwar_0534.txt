nce judgements on the war itself were often of considerable importance. Overall strategy was, for example, dependent on an assessment of what an enemy was Page 206 of 309 76% satisfactorily, and throughout the war the section dealing with foreign air forces provided good and prompt reports of new aircraft in service with enemy air forces.®2° Air intelligence in Britain hada producing and hence what an enemy air force would be operationally capable of. Before the outbreak of war the tendency was for German production and strength to be exaggerated by the western Allies. This spurred on efforts to greater rearmament than might otherwise have been undertaken. Actual figures of production during the 1930s were known with some accuracy, but the growing fear of Germany also fuelled less critical and exaggerated claims about German air strength.835 Even air intelligence overestimated the number of aircraft Germany would produce under war conditions, and consequently exaggerated the degree of reserves available for the Luftwaffe.836 On the other hand German air intelligence underestimated the potential strength of the western allies. Information on the French air force was accurate enough. The main miscalculation involved the strength and effectiveness of the RAF. The result was the poor intelligence available for the Battle of Britain. Not only was British aircraft production substantially miscalculated, but the degree of destruction wrought on the RAF was widely and wishfully exaggerated (as were British claims about the Luftwaffe). False intelligence claims contributed on several occasions during 1940 to the short-lived belief that the RAF had been defeated.837  This initial failure began the long process of undermining the credibility of German air intelligence with the German military and political leadership. The same happened with the attack on the USSR and the entry of the United States into the war. In the first case the general Luftwaffe view that the Russian air
