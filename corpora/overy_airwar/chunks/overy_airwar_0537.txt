ch as the use of proper navigational aids, had a considerable effect on the success of operations. In other areas conventional counter-intelligence was used, with particularly good effect in the diversion of V-weapon attacks from London.®*2 The gathering of satisfactory intelligence on bomb damage had a considerable impact on the course of the bombing campaign. In 1941 photo-reconnaissance evidence confirmed that accurate bombing was a myth. The shift to area bombing that followed called for rather different forms of intelligence contacts in Luftwaffe intelligence destroyed the leadership's confidence in its integrity.®34 This was a difficulty any air force in defeat was bound to face. Having to present the description of that defeat fear of Germany also fuelled less critical and exaggerated claims about German air strength.®2° Even air intelligence overestimated the number of aircraft Germany would produce under war conditions, and consequently exaggerated the degree of reserves available for the Luftwaffe.®26 On the other hand German air intelligence underestimated the potential strength of the western allies. contradicted the view maintained by Luftwaffe intelligence and supported uncritically by Goering.828 The same mistake was made about the United States.

The Axis decision to 1944840 By this stage the discussion was largely academic. Both sides knew that there existed a wide disparity of numbers while Allied intelligence knew that German production even under the the degree of effort required on particular operations.“ In all three areas scientific intelligence, which was much more developed and influential than its German counterpart, was used to reach a used, with particularly good effect in the diversion of V-weapon attacks from London.®“2 The gat
