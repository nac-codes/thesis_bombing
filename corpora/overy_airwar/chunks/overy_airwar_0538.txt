Evidence such as there was was conflicting. A comprehensive picture of the impact of bomb damage was begun in 1943 with Operational Research assessments of bombing campaigns in North Africa and the attack on Italy, and the subsequent diversion of bombing to targets for ‘Overlord’ followed by a precise target attack on oil and communications resulted from the conclusions of OR that morale was too diffuse and unsystematic a target.843 To the end of the war in Europe, however, Bomber Command placed too much faith in an intuitive assessment of likely bomb effect and continued to area bomb at night. After the war the bombing surveys confirmed that the more conservative analysis of the effects of bombing by Allied intelligence had been justified. On the Axis side, however, fear of bombing was partly a product of ignorance of Allied intentions. Intelligence on the Combined Offensive, and on the later B-29 bombing of Japan, was slight and although it improved in Germany with the capture of airmen and the reclamation of damaged Allied bombers, intelligence information was never sufficient to predict major shifts in tactics or strategy, to prepare for technical innovations in advance, or even to fully prepare for attacks on the vulnerable points of the economy.®44 The increasing difficulties facing Garman intellisence stemmed fram the same isalatinn fram which scientific research suffered Gand intelligence infarmatian cauld anly he ohtained hv esninnage  Page 205 of 309 76% to Goering or hitler encouraged Oover-optimism and a lack Of realism 1n intelligence assessments, and made them far less useful to German alr Commands than they mignt nave been. con
