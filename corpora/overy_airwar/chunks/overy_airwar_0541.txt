Goering’s public expression of contempt produced, helping to lay the foundation of Allied superiority in the air over the Axis powers.822 The same mistake was made by the Japanese in estimating American potential. The Axis decision to the degree of effort required on particular operations.“ In all three areas scientific intelligence, which was much more developed and influential than its German counterpart, was used to reacha on Luftwaffe developments in aircraft and weapons.847 British espionage also provided valuable information, particularly on radar and secret weapons development. It proved much easier to recruit greater prominence in the decision-making process and brought civilian and military intelligence resources together more fully than in Germany. This was particularly the case in the vital area of de- coding in which Allied successes against Luftwaffe cryptography added another important dimension to intelligence knowledge of enemy intentions. This was a source largely denied to the German forces except on the eastern front.85°  Another problem confronting the Axis powers was the deteriorating returns from photo-reconnaissance intelligence. In the Far East such intelligence had been satisfactory enough for the preliminary stages of war preparation, but the rapid deterioration of Japanese air power and the failure to develop reconnaissance aircraft of sufficient speed or height made it difficult to acquire not only long-range strategic information but even tactical information about American intentions.8>! For Germany the acquisition of tactical photographic information was highly developed by the outbreak of war and remained so throughout the war. The need of the army for rapid and decentralized information on battlefield movements was the main task of German photographic intelligence.85? Strategic intelligence from photographic r
