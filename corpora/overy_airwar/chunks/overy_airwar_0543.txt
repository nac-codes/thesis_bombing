For Germany the acquisition of tactical photographic information was highly developed intelligence.852 Strategic intelligence from photographic reconnaissance was much less well developed, and over the course of the war seriously declined, particularly in the west. One reason lay photographic intelligence built up. The personnel involved were low-ranking and were trained more as photo-readers than as interpreters.8°3 Moreover the Luftwaffe insistence on the use of armed reconnaissance aircraft, capable of fighting for photographic intelligence, a legacy of battlefield experience, led to increasing difficulties as older, converted bomber types were forced to combat with advanced Allied fighter aircraft. There were technical problems too. German cameras could not be loaded into small, fast aircraft, a fact which discouraged the Luftwaffe yet further from innovation in strategic reconnaissance. In the Mediterranean the attempt to achieve great height as a protection by pressurizing older Ju 86 civil aircraft failed at almost the first attempt because of new British developments in high altitude fighters.®54 Another technical problem facing German reconnaissance was the existence of good radar on the part of the Allies, a fact that also contributed to the decline of Japanese reconnaissance  Page 208 of 309 76% ne ee —=——lUlUeOU re ne strategy, to prepare for technical innovations in advance, or even to fully prepare for attacks on the vulnerable points of the economy.844 of the state of the Russian air force.®46 Russian successes in Germany and occupied Europe were by contrast impressive.
