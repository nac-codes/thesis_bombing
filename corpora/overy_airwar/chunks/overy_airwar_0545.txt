The Blenheim aircraft designed for the purpose was intended to act asa combat reconnaissance aircraft for which it was clearly inadequate; camera equipment was, by German standards, technically backward; and there was no satisfactory organization for relaying tactical photographic intelligence to the army units under combat conditions.857 Improvements came about because of strategic circumstances. After the fall of France photo-reconnaissance was the only way of getting information quickly on German intentions. It was also the only way of providing pre- and post-operational intelligence on bombing. It was in this enterprise that the strategic importance of photo-reconnaissance was recognized from an early date. The Battle of France also brought about tactical changes. During May 1940 the decision was made to abandon the fighting reconnaissance tactic and to adopt the practice already demonstrated by the ad hoc Photographic Development Unit of using high-altitude and speed as ways of evading German defence. Spitfires were modified for such work, long-range was added by using additional fuel tanks, and virtual immunity for strategic photographic reconnaissance achieved for the crucial war period from summer 1940 until the summer of 1944.858 More important the intelligence thus acquired was interpreted and disseminated through higher echelon intelligence agencies which were in turn integrated into the wider intelligence system.85° Tactical air reconnaissance similarly improved for the Allies through better communication and equipment, and more advanced camera technology due to the recruitment of the American optical industry.8©° The armed forces in general came to expect a high level of photographic intelligence for almost all operational preparation.
