For Germany the acquisition of tactical photographic information was highly developed photographic intelligence built up. The personnel involved were low-ranking and were trained more as photo-readers than as interpreters.853 Moreover the Luftwaffe insistence on the use of armed fighters.£54 Another technical problem facing German reconnaissance was the existence of good radar on the part of the Allies, a fact that also contributed to the decline of Japanese reconnaissance The Allied experience was almost exactly the reverse. In Britain photographic intelligence had been poorly prepared. The Blenheim aircraft designed for the purpose was intended to act as a into the wider intelligence system.®52 Tactical air reconnaissance similarly improved for the Allies through better communication and equipment, and more advanced camera technology due to the (iv) Scientific Intelligence  The greatest contrast between the intelligence efforts of the two sides lay, however, in the degree to which science was utilized for intelligence purposes. This was not universally the case. Russian radar remained below the standards of German radar, and low-level tactical radio intelligence was readily accessible on the eastern front to both sides.8* But in the west and in the far eastern war great emphasis was placed on radar and radio both for intelligence and for successful air operations. To some extent the difference in emphasis was based on strategic needs. The critical area for scientific intelligence in Britain in the early years of preparation and war was satisfactory aerial defence, with a good early warning system for short-term intelligence purposes. Later, with the onset of the bombing offensives, it became necessary to use radar and radio aids as means of confusing the intelligence effort of the enem
