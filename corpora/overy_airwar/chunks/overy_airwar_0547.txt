system for short-term intelligence purposes. Later, with the onset of the bombing offensives, it became necessary to use radar and radio aids as means of confusing the intelligence effort of the enemy as well as for improving navigation and bombing accuracy.  In 1940 the gap in research was not as wide as British intelligence at first believed. The difference lay in how radar was used. German strategy emphasized a flexible radar use for battlefield intelligence and the appropriate technology was produced for accurate prediction of range and speed, though not altitude, of attacking aircraft.

For Germany the acquisition of tactical photographic information was highly developed photographic sorties permitted by the RAF for deception purposes.®*> Only the introduction of a limited number of the new Arado 234 jet aircraft improved strategic reconnaissance, but far too late to tactical photographic intelligence to the army units under combat conditions.85”7 Improvements came about because of strategic circumstances. After the fall of France photo-reconnaissance was north German coast for warning against British attacks.8°2 Had the situation been reversed in 1940 and the battle been fought over Germany instead of Britain, radar would have provided ample advance warning for the Luftwaffe as it did for the RAF. Nevertheless the main weight of German radar research was for use with the army at the battlefront and only secondarily for defence purposes. The lack of a sustained bombing offensive also reduced the urgency of radar research. There were other contrasts as well. Where in Germany the Luftwaffe signal
