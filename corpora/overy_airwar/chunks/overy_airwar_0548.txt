d only secondarily for defence purposes. The lack of a sustained bombing offensive also reduced the urgency of radar research. There were other contrasts as well. Where in Germany the Luftwaffe signals section had the main task of undertaking research and scientific intelligence tasks in the Luftwaffe with little outside contact, the British and American radar and radio effort was one of the first to be brought into the civilian scientific war effort as fully as possible.8®3 University, service and industrial resources were used to the full to solve particular problems as they arose and to anticipate the next steps to be attempted Page 209 of 309 77% a photographic intelligence built up. The personnel involved were low- -ranking and were trained more as photo- -readers than as interpreters.852 853 Moreover the Luftwaffe insistence on the use of armed photographic sorties permitted by the RAF for deception purposes.®*5 Only the introduction of a limited number of the new Arado 234 jet aircraft improved strategic reconnaissance, but far too late to tactical photographic intelligence to the army units under combat conditions.®*” Improvements came about because of strategic circumstances. After the fall of France photo-reconnaissance was by the enemy in the radio war. The German effort lacked the same urgency, in fact Hitler proscribed further research in 1940, and the poor recruitment of science in areas regarded as less essential led to a particular shortage of radio scientists and engineers.*® With the onset of the bombing offensive, though not before, it became apparent that German radar was caught in a position of permanent inferiority given the current state of radio technology. Every attempt to combat Allied radar and radio was in response to initiatives undertaken by the Allies who were all the time in the process of developing yet more sophisticated means of identification or deception. In fact the most successful period of German night-fighting came in the win
