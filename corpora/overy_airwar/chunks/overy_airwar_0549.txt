y the Allies who were all the time in the process of developing yet more sophisticated means of identification or deception. In fact the most successful period of German night-fighting came in the winter of 1943-44 when the Luftwaffe gave up producing its own radio novelties and used those of the enemy for accurate interception.8© The late development of centimetric radar sets, which was abandoned early in the war as impossible to achieve practically within the likely duration of hostilities, did close the gap rapidly again between German and Allied radio technology, but they were developed only by late 1944 when the problem was an insufficiency of aircraft in which to mount them.®° By that year air superiority had been largely achieved. In preparation for ‘Overlord’ even the radar network that the Germans possessed in France proved inoperable because the precision attacks on coastal stations by the RAF were of such accuracy and comprehensiveness that the invasion remained concealed until the arrival at the Normandy beaches. Moreover the improvements made on the German side in centralized reception and dissemination of radio information that had been lacking at the beginning of the war were frequently overwhelmed by the sheer diversity of intelligence methods devised to black out defensive radar, jam radio communications and obscure the actual bombing target.8” When the same methods were tried bv the AAF against Tanan.

After the fall of France photo-reconnaissance was into the wider intelligence system.852 Tactical air reconnaissance similarly improved for the Allies through better communication and equipment, and more advanced camera technology due to the recru
