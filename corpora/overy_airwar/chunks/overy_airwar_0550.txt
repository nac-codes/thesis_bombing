as into the wider intelligence system.852 Tactical air reconnaissance similarly improved for the Allies through better communication and equipment, and more advanced camera technology due to the recruitment of the American optical industry.8° The armed forces in general came to expect a high level of photographic intelligence for almost all operational preparation. radar remained below the standards of German radar, and low-level tactical radio intelligence was readily accessible on the eastern front to both sides.®* But in the west and in the far eastern war north German coast for warning against British attacks.862 Had the situation been reversed in 1940 and the battle been fought over Germany instead of Britain, radar would have provided ample scientific war effort as fully as possible.863 University, service and industrial resources were used to the full to solve particular problems as they arose and to anticipate the next steps to be attempted to a particular shortage of radio scientists and engineers.’ With the onset of the bombing offensive, though not before, it became apparent that German radar was caught in a position of permanent producing its own radio novelties and used those of the enemy for accurate interception.8©5 The late development of centimetric radar sets, which was abandoned early in the war as impossible to was an insufficiency of aircraft in which to mount them.8° By that year air superiority had been largely achieved. In preparation for ‘Overlord’ even the radar network that the Germans possessed in frequently overwhelmed by the sheer diversity of intelligence methods devised to black out defensive radar, jam radio communications and obscure the actual bombing target.867 When the same methods were tried by the AAF against Japan, Japanese radar, which was technically much more underdeveloped, was unable to cope and anti-aircraft crews were forced to rely on chance searchlight interceptions in the absence of effective gun-laying radar.868 The
