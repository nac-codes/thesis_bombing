which was technically much more underdeveloped, was unable to cope and anti-aircraft crews were forced to rely on chance searchlight interceptions in the absence of effective gun-laying radar.868 The pace of the radio war had developed so rapidly during the war, and had required so great a concentration of effort, that the weapons available to the Allied bombers were as distant from the weapons of 1940, with which the Japanese were still armed, as those of 1940 had been from the First World War.  To some extent the intellectual effort of the air war, like the economic effort, was a question of resources. The complex and expensive new technology with which the air war was fought could no longer be produced in small workshops by enthusiastic aircraft engineers but required large government-sponsored teams of researchers with the most up-to-date scientific and engineering facilities. Some of the belligerent powers were therefore excluded a priori from competing effectively in the scientific race. Germany was by no means one of these. Generously endowed with scientific resources, both material and human, and with a lead in theoretical physics in a number of areas important to air warfare, the possibility appeared to exist that the lack of quantity of German aircraft could be adequately compensated for by a large marginal advantage in quality. That this failed to be the case was due partly to the circumstances of war â€” the isolation of the science community, the differences between offensive and defensive strategies for science; but it was due more to strategic miscalculation, military inflexibility and the widespread intervention of fascist politics, both grand and petty, which reduced the willingness of the scientific community to work for German victory or demoralized those in research or intelligence who were committed to doing so.
