In preparation for ‘Overlord’ even the radar network that the Germans possessed in frequently overwhelmed by the sheer diversity of intelligence methods devised to black out defensive radar, jam radio communications and obscure the actual bombing target.8” When the same research it was not simply Nazi misjudgements that affected the overall degree of intellectual mobilization, but also the dominant place that the military enjoyed in the making of war. Such dominance required, for example, thorough direction over research, the integration of PR units with the army, and the recruitment for the front of skilled radio technicians needed by the intelligence services. Such inflexibility made it difficult to establish the same degree of contact and co-operation between academics, administrators and soldiers as was enjoyed in all the Allied powers. The peculiar organizational and political structure of Nazism, which discouraged centralization and reduced areas of useful co-operation was the final
