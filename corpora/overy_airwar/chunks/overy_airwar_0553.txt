The peculiar organizational and political structure of Nazism, which discouraged centralization and reduced areas of useful co-operation was the final factor in explaining the low level of mobilization in Germany of the one other resource, besides the Prussian tradition, of which the Nazi leadership might have made use in planning and executing aggressive war. This is not to detract from the scientific achievements of the Allies which were in themselves considerable.

By that year air superiority had been largely achieved. In preparation for ‘Overlord’ even the radar network that the Germans possessed in frequently overwhelmed by the sheer diversity of intelligence methods devised to black out defensive radar, jam radio communications and obscure the actual bombing target.8©2 When the same technical development in Britain and the United States showed what could be achieved, even by the slow starter, provided intellectual resources were properly used; and provided
