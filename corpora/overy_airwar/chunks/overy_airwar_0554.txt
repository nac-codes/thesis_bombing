rget.8©2 When the same technical development in Britain and the United States showed what could be achieved, even by the slow starter, provided intellectual resources were properly used; and provided the organization was flexible enough to allow scientists and engineers to give advice, without restraint, not only to the commanders in battle, but to the politicians who directed the war. 9 ~ Conclusions Page 211 of 309 78% was an insufficiency of aircraft in which to mount them.®° By that year air superiority had been largely achieved. In preparation for ‘Overlord’ even the radar network that the Germans possessed in frequently overwhelmed by the sheer diversity of intelligence methods devised to black out defensive radar, jam radio communications and obscure the actual bombing target.86” When the same Aircraft did not replace navies and armies during the Second World War. Although the use to which aircraft were put expanded and matured during the war years, the fact remained that successful warfare still depended upon the movement of armies to occupy land, and the movement of ships to provide supplies and men. Aircraft made such endeavours more secure and more expeditious but they did not, as some feared, make them obsolete. Indeed the popular expectations of air warfare, shared to some extent by uncritical soldiers and politicians, were rapidly disillusioned. Britain still depended decisively on her maritime and trading strength, even if aircraft were needed to safeguard it. The great land armies of Europe were the instruments of victory for the Germans from 1939-41, for the Russians after 1942, using aircraft as one element in an extensive armoury. Nevertheless air power became in a number of theatres the component without which the military machine could not be made to work. In the war in the Far East aircraft decided sea battles, symbolized in the Battle of the Coral Sea in which not a naval gun was fired though great losses were sustained from air attack on both
