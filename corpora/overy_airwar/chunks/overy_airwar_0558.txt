lving a large-scale air defence at home, combined with a large commitment to naval aviation, would have made air force co-operation with the army on the Russian front more, rather than less, secure. It was the realization from early in the war that air power, to be effective, could not be divisible that distinguished the attitude of the Allies from that of the Axis powers.  The contrast between general and limited air power illustrated more general differences in strategic circumstances. From the start the British and American governments were committed to  9 Macca avarnica nf air Nawar and aaarad anvarnmant noliew tn euch an and Dancawalt urac inenirad hy a firm eanuictinn of tha imnartanca of air nawrar Tn Mary 10/41 ha avnraccad tha hana that warfare still depended upon the movement of armies to occupy land, and the movement of ships to provide supplies and men.

On the eastern front a limited air war was fought; in the west a general a massive exercise of air power and geared government policy to such an end. Roosevelt was inspired by a firm conviction of the importance of air power. In May 1941 he expressed the hope that ‘command of the air by the democracies must be and can be achieved. Every month the democracies are gaining in the relative strength of the air forces. We must see to it that the process is hastened and that the democratic superiority in the air is made absolute’.8®2 To this view he stuck throughout the war. ‘The Nazis and fascists have asked for it’, he told Congress, ‘and they are going to get it... we and the British and the Russians will hit them from the air heavily and relentlessly...’.27° From the outset German and Japanese air policy was more cautious. In the German case this was rooted in Hitler’s openly expressed belief that ‘a country cannot
