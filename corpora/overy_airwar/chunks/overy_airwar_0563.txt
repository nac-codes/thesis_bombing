30s it was used extensively by the fascist powers to show how air power embodied the spirit of the new fascist soldiers. It was used just as widely in the Soviet Union as an open expression of the challenge of socialism against the west and as a mark of Stalin’s personal responsibility for the creation of modern Russia. ‘Observing comrade Stalin’s daily work in the area of aviation’, wrote Kaganovich in 1936, ‘we can say without any trace of exaggeration that the founder and the creator of our Soviet aviation is our teacher and leader comrade Stalin.’8?3 When Hitler caused the film of Luftwaffe experience in Poland, ‘The Baptism of Fire’, to be shown in the embassies of neutral countries in 1940 and 1941 the object was to complete the myth that German air power was invincible, and was in itself the cause of Axis victories.  When war broke out the Allies, too, made use of the powerful imagery and appeal of air power in their propaganda. The Battle of Britain was used as a symbol of democratic resistance to fascism and dominated the themes of British propaganda throughout the war. The air attack at Pearl Harbor became the great betrayal that justified the American people in their resolve to punish Japan. In both cases ample justification for the future bombing campaigns was created. Churchill's belief that his government should be seen to be hitting back at the Axis powers justified the early exaggeration of the efficacy of bombing and its support above all other operations in the winter and summer of 1941. Both Britain and the United States took advantage of the hostile propaganda surrounding Axis bombings to explain the devotion of huge resources to the Allied bombing even in the face of hostile criticism at home on moral and military grounds, or in the face of opinion-poll evidence which COTMUNCTUION WiItIl S€a POWET, SIICE LETS Was flO Crlemy WIitiiit DOMDINE falige.
