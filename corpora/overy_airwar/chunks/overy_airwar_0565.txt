rt while, it was later alleged, clinically dead gained wide currency precisely because it underpinned old military virtues of sacrifice and duty in one of the few remaining areas of combat where the individual soldier was still distinguishable from the mass.876 In these ways air power was used to construct a popular image of the war, and the reasons for fighting it, of enduring quality. Page 215 of 309 79% The growth of such ‘air-mindedness’ resulted not only from propaganda and the air power culture that developed during the war, but also from the fact that for many non-combatants the war only bore upon them in a military sense through air attack. The very nature of the weapon determined from the outset that civilian communities would not remain immune from attack. If some effort was made in Europe to prevent this from happening indiscriminately as a direct act of military policy, no such effort was made in the war between China and Japan; and it was the latter example that prevailed everywhere once it became clear that military purposes were served directly by bomb attack on rear areas. Moreover the British decision to concentrate on German working-class housing as a specific target system in 1941, and the later American decision to treat Japanese cities as military targets of a general character, made it inevitable that civilian communities would be drawn into the military struggle. Even those countries not subject to air attack, or only to a limited extent, were compelled to adopt widespread measures of civil and passive defence so that the expectation of bombing as much as its reality linked civilians to the war in a regular and positive way.  In those communities actually exposed to bombing the periods of physical attack itself were brief and spasmodic, and the spread of destruction beyond the large industrial cities was slight. It was the more general social impact of bombing that made the bomber the weapon of total war. The widespread destruction of urban ho
