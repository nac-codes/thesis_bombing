read of destruction beyond the large industrial cities was slight. It was the more general social impact of bombing that made the bomber the weapon of total war. The widespread destruction of urban housing, the constant interruptions to normal civilian life, the movement of refugees and evacuees from bombing, all brought much larger sections of the community into direct contact with the results of the air war. Nor were the casualties themselves insignificant compared with casualties in battle. In Germany the air war killed more civilians than all British and American casualties together. In Japan more people were killed in six months of heavy aerial bombardment than in the whole United States war effort.827 In China a large percentage of the dead from the war with Japan were the casualties of bombing.

Such figures certainly affected morale. Comparatively lower casualties during the Blitz on Britain in 1940-41 led to conditions of demoralization in certain areas.878 Yet not even in those countries exposed to heavy and continuous bomb attack did morale in any general sense give way. This was partly because governments could not easily be compelled to accept surrender on the basis of the suffering of the civilian community while the armies were still fighting; and partly because those communities suffering from demoralizing bomb attack retained insufficient political energy to demand that a government surrender rather than face further attacks. In Japan it
