pilots were expected to be capable of overcoming even the most advanced technology pitted against them. In Germany, too, the fighting qualities of the airmen were stressed above everything else. To Hitler what counted was the will. If pilots and soldiers possessed sufficient faith in victory, and fought with sufficient tenacity and courage, no mere numerical or technical advantage could overcome them. Goering, on the strength of his experiences in the First World War, retained a naive belief that ‘personal heroism must always count for more than technical novelties’.889 However much the Axis powers attempted to strength of his experiences in the First World War, retained a naive belief that ‘personal heroism must always count for more than technical novelties’.28° However much the Axis powers attempted to halt defeat by a final economic effort, there still existed the romantic expectation that valour must triumph over mere material power.  If there was no shortage of valour on the Allied side, it was nevertheless the additional mobilization of non-military resources that won not only the air war but the wider war as well. Being less well prepared militarily and with a proportionately smaller military establishment, the Allied powers had no other recourse but to use the administrative and political elites for the task of planning and running the war. In Russia this situation was underlined by the desire of the party to utilize all the resources released through the modernization drive to stem fascism; and to leave control over such mobilization in the hands of the civilian Communist authorities. In Britain and the United States the political structure itself, coupled with the high degree of social modernization characteristic of such a structure, dictated that the war, while fought by soldiers, would be planned, supplied, researched for and profited from by civilians. Hence the stress in the western powers on economic effort, on massive production as a key to victory
