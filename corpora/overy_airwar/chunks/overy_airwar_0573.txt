classes — in fact they were in most cases confirmed — but in breaking down barriers between elites. This meant ensuring that soldiers and engineers co- operated fully in scientific and technical fields and even in the field of battle itself; that managers and entrepreneurs and designers were given at least equal weight with the military in the general political framework within which the war was conducted. It was much harder to achieve such a crossing of social frontiers in the Axis powers. In Germany and Japan military distrust of, and disdain for, commercial life and the values of modern civilian institutions made it much harder to produce co-operation between the two sides; just as the exclusiveness and protectionism of the other elites, whether academic, commercial or bureaucratic obstructed the military in what efforts were made to penetrate and use them for the war effort. When the competing interests of the fascist party elites were introduced as well the result was political confusion and conflict rather than co-operation in the national interest. Such constraints, although overcome to some extent by the end of the war, were nevertheless sufficient to cancel out those advantages which the military tradition on its own supplied. The development of nuclear weapons subsequently allowed the military establishment of the major powers to retreat toa much more selective and soldierly environment again, though conscious of the debt owed to science and industry. But the Axis powers were caught at a stage where the nature of warfare and war technology made necessary the total commitment of social resources. In the air war the inability to carry out such mobilization effectively was an important determinant of victory once Axis sights were raised to that of a world struggle. The war of 1939-45 saw a unique and incongruous union of traditional and industrialized warfare. Nowhere were the contradictions that such a union produced more clearly expressed and more decisive
