studies are Michael Sherry, The Rise of American Air Power: The Creation of Armageddon (New Haven, 1987), and Ronald Schaffer, Wings of Judgment (New York, 1985). There has been a growing tendency to discuss bombing in moral terms, apportioning blame and responsibility. This is the central thesis of Jorg Friedrich’s book Der Brand (Munich, 2002), in which the author presents area bombing as the great unacknowledged war crime. Understanding why bombing was adopted by two liberal democracies who should, as Freidrich argues, have behaved differently is the most important and the most difficult issue to confront. Several recent studies have reconstructed the historical environment in which these choices were made to show that bombing was not a simple strategic option but the product of preferred metaphors of combat, political pressures and rational perceptions of ‘total war’ as an expression of technical and economic modernity. The best of these assessments are Tami Biddle, Rhetoric and Reality in Air Warfare: the Evolution of British and American Ideas about Strategic Bombing 1914-1945 (Princeton, 2002); Kenneth Werrell, Blankets of Fire: US Bombers over Japan during World War II (Washington, 1995); and John Buckley, Air Power in the Age of Total War (London, 1999).

Here recent studies have tended to emphasise the limitations of the application of air power and to expose the exaggerated claims made for the tactical impact of aircraft. Among the most original and challenging of these assessments has been the article by W. Hays Park, “Precision” and “Area” Bombing: Who Did Which and When?’ reproduced in a book of essays edited by John Gooch, Airpower: Theory and Practice (London, 1995). Park points out that American boasts about precision bombing were simply not true since most bombs missed the stated target, often by a w
