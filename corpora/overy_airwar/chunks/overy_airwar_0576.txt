d by John Gooch, Airpower: Theory and Practice (London, 1995). Park points out that American boasts about precision bombing were simply not true since most bombs missed the stated target, often by a wide margin, and the majority of operations were conducted through cloud as ‘blind bombing’. It is perhaps no accident that the official history of American air intelligence in the Second World War, published in Washington in 1996, was titled Piercing the Fog: Intelligence and Army Air Forces Operations in World War II. The work of Ian Gooderson has highlighted another enduring myth by showing in his Air Power at the Battlefront (London, 1998) that the Allied fighter-bomber was much less effective in destroying targets than was once believed and that much of its battlefield impact came from frightening enemy soldiers or tank crews rather than destroying their capacity to fight. Roland Stolfi in Hitler’s Panzers East: World War II Reinterpreted (Norman, OK, 1991) makes the same point about German aircraft on the Eastern Front, where German tanks and artillery were more likely to destroy Soviet tanks than were German dive-bombers. The tactical re-evaluation of the German air force, which carried all before it in the first two years of land warfare, is well exposed in Joel Hayward, Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler’s Defeat in the East 1942-1943 (Lawrence, KS, 1998) and in the recent volumes of the German official history, Das Deutsche Reich und der Zweite Weltkrieg.  Leadership in air warfare has also been well served by many scholarly biographies. Hermann Géring has been thoroughly explored in Alfred Kube, Pour le mérite und Hakenkreuz: Hermann Géring im Dritten Reich (Munich, 1986). There are fine studies of Harris, Arnold and Spaatz. Henry Probert’s Bomber Harris: His Life and Times (London, 2001) is the first study to make full use of Harris’s own  naners: Nik Nasa in Han Arnald and tho Fvaliutinn af American Air Pawer (Washinstan 2000) chaws that Arnald
