ris: His Life and Times (London, 2001) is the first study to make full use of Harris’s own  naners: Nik Nasa in Han Arnald and tho Fvaliutinn af American Air Pawer (Washinstan 2000) chaws that Arnald was ane af a new seneratian af eammanders as ‘military managere’ rather than eamhat  papers; Dik Daso in Hap Arnold and the Evolution of American Air Power (Washington, 2000) shows that Arnold was one of a new generation of commanders as ‘military managers’ rather than combat airmen; Richard Davis’s study, Carl A.

There is much on economics, technology and science in the excellent volume of essays edited by Horst Boog, The Conduct of the Air War in the Second World War: an International Comparison (Oxford, 1992), which ca
