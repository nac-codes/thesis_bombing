Uri Bialer in The Shadow of the Bomber: the Fear of Air Attack and British Politics 1936-1939 (London, 1980) explored the development of popular attitudes to the threat of air attack in terms of the popular imagination; air power was both enthralling and menacing at the same time, a paradox cleverly exploited in Peter Fritzsche’s A Nation of Flyers: German Aviation and the Popular Imagination (Cambridge, MA, 1992).
