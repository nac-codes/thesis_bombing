so available in the bombing surveys. The USSBS is particularly useful and I have been able to use the survey collection at the War Museum. The published intelligence reports of CIOS and BIOS also provide a wealth of neglected material. Details of both sources are provided below. Finally I have consulted a number of miscellaneous collections housed at Churchill College, Cambridge. The most useful have been the Christie papers for material on Britain and Germany, the Weir papers, the Swinton papers and the papers of Lord Thurso. References to these collections, and to British parliamentary debates and papers can be found in the footnotes.
