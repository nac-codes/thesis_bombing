Air Ministry organized an exhibition in Washington in early January 1943, which was visited by Vice President Henry Wallace and later taken to the White House to show to Roosevelt. Wallace, it was reported, was “completely sold on the necessity of bombing Germany” as a result of what he had seen, and keen to pass on his impressions to the president. The RAF delegation in America thought of producing a film to assist Arnold’s efforts to present the bombing offensive to the American public.4 At Casablanca, Arnold fielded a full team with both Eaker and Spaatz in attendance to argue the air force case; Portal had chosen to take Slessor, a sociable air force diplomat with planning experience, rather than Harris, whose bluntness would have been out of place in the delicate discussions to follow.  It is difficult to assess whether these propaganda efforts really affected the final decision to approve a combined offensive. The outcome for the two bomber forces was in the end mixed. The Casablanca Directive was a loosely worded document, a set of hopeful intentions rather than a clear plan “that could have been made by any schoolboy,” as one senior RAF officer later put it.2 Months aaainet urhich taraate 10 Arnald hamaanad tha saheanra of anv dafinita nlan fram 4 Rritich air farce “urithaut ctranath in ani ana nlaca ta urin dacicivaliy”11 An Cantamhar 10 10/49 hie nlannina ctafFin force at his disposal, and the eventual raid, code-named Tannenberg, took place only on January 17, in the middle of the conference, long after Stalin too had lost patience with the constant delays.* In against which targets.1° Arnold bemoaned the absence of any definite plan from a British air force “without strength in any one place to win decisively.”44 On September 19, 1942, his planning staff in TAT Lien eh ee deed Ane we eet 1 TAT A -Ea n  Detat 2 en tn oO nee anne Dee ee 2 ne eee te Leek 2 nd eek etn de Le etn oe Page 107 of 562 20% to a potentially skeptical audience.
