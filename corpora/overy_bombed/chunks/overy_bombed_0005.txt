It was also designed to fit in with the priorities of the other services and the political leadership. Bombing was accepted at Casablanca as one force at his disposal, and the eventual raid, code-named Tannenberg, took place only on January 17, in the middle of the conference, long after Stalin too had lost patience with the constant delays.® In Churchill's first promise, did Stalin finally acknowledge the news that Berlin had been raided.” There was impatience, too, in both London and Washington, with the slow progress of the Eighth Air first American raid on a German target was launched only on January 27, 1943, when fifty-nine bombers attacked the port at Wilhelmshaven three days after the end of the conference.® Arnold later against which targets.1° Arnold bemoaned the absence of any definite plan from a British air force “without strength in any one place to win decisively.”11 On September 19, 1942, his planning staff in Washington produced a detailed operational plan, AWPD-42, which resembled the British commitment to wearing Germany down prior to a land invasion, but spelled out minutely how this was to be achieved.
