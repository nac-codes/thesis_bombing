In October he asked Dwight D.

RAF leaders waited to see what would happen with daylight attacks before deciding whether to insist that the American air force accept the alternative of night bombing.1® The American air force delegates at Casablanca knew that this was an argument they had to win. After clearing the request with Eisenhower on January 13, Arnold invited Eaker to fly to Morocco to help him present the case for the American offensive. Arnold warned him at once that Churchill had already suggested to Roosevelt that the Eighth Air Force switch to night bombing under RAF control. Eaker was asked to draft notes for “The Case for Day Bombing”; he prepared a one-page synopsis with seven principal arguments to show to Churchill and a fuller version to help Arnold influence the Combined Chiefs of Staff.17  Although it was unlikely that Churchill would get his way, given the weight of British and American opinion in favor of trying out the day-bombing experiment, the risk existed that Roosevelt would be too preoccupied with other issues to notice.
