Each installation was awarded a point score: 1+ for factories of leading importance to the war effort; 1 for major plants in major industries; 2 for minor plants in major industries or major plants in minor industries; and 3 for factories of small importance.* These scores were then calculated with population size to produce a league table of German cities that Harris kept with him at his headquarters. The list eventually reached over 100 cities, with “key-point ratings” attached to each one—ranging from Berlin at number 1 with 545 to Wittenberg at number 104 with a rating of just 9. Harris crossed out each city on the list as they were attacked.*4 American commanders rejected the idea of city bombing and were skeptical of the claim that morale attacks would diminish the German war effort or create a widespread crisis.
