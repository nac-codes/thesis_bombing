At a meeting called in the Air Ministry in March 1943 by Sydney Bufton, now promoted to director of bomber operations, the American representative asked for an explanation of what Bomber Command was trying to do: “Was it to kill Germans; to cause them to expend man hours; or was it to do specific damage to some certain installation?”2* There was an awkward pause until Bufton announced that it was to neutralize German man-hours, a strategic commitment not expressed in any directive. When Eaker sent a draft of the American plans for fulfilling Casablanca to Spaatz in April, Bomber Command’s effort was described no fewer than four times as little more than “concentrated attacks against related areas and cities.”?” The assumption in American planning was that Bomber Command would now help the Eighth Air Force, not the other way around. Unlike Harris, Arnold and Eaker wanted to build on the Casablanca Directive to produce a strategic directive that made greater sense. The driving force behind American planning was the belief that whatever the air forces did over the coming year, they should contribute to making the invasion of Europe possible. The air force mission statement defined “fatally weakened” as “so weakened as to permit initiation of final combined operations on the Continent,” which gave bombing a defined strategic purpose.2® Arnold asked the Committee of Operations Analysts in Washington, set up in December 1942 under the prominent lawyer Elihu Root Jr., to draft a list of targets whose destruction would contribute to Axis defeat; staffed by men from business and the professions, the committee supplied the data on nineteen industrial target systems by March 1943.72 Arnold instructed Eaker to work out with Portal the precise number of targets and the degree of operational effort required to Capes.
