horter and brighter. It had been drafted chiefly by Portal’s strong support on May 18.4? The new directive for what was code-named Operation Pointblank was issued to Harris and Eaker on June 10, 1943. The close link with the planning for Operation The nature of air battle required numerous well-equipped permanent bases, an extensive maintenance organization, a large stock of spares, and, in the case of the Eighth Air Force, a long transoceanic logistics tail. The sharp end of air combat was supported by a ground organization many times larger than the aircrew on which the campaign rested. There was no supporting infantry in air combat.  Bomber Command became a substantial force only in the spring of 1943 as the changeover from medium to heavy bomber production was finally completed. By March 1943 it was planned to have forty-nine heavy-bomber squadrons, by June as many as sixty out of a worldwide total of 431 RAF units of all types. Heavy-bomber squadrons made up 7 percent of RAF squadron strength in September 1942, 14 percent by the summer of 1943.4* This was still far short of what Harris had wanted. In January 1943 there were still only an average of 514 heavy bombers and crews operationally ready. Harris’s command reached its peak strength in heavy bombers only in 1944 and 1945; the same was true for pilot strength, which was not much greater in 1943 than it had been in late 1941, though each of the heavier aircraft they flew dropped up to four times the weight of bombs (see table 2.1 for the growth of Bomber Command). The overall size of the command was dictated by the need for specialized ground personnel, which meant by the start of 1943 a combat strength of 23,000 aircrew (including training and OTU personnel) and a supporting force of 138,000 men and women, a ratio of 1:6. As the force of heavy bombers and pilots expanded, the ratio changed. By the end of the war there were 49,000 aircrew supported by 174,000 ground staff, a ratio of 1:3.5.47 Women made fou
