of the Second Bombardment Wing, to take over the Eighth Bomber Command. The force was divided into three air divisions and then into combat wings, each with its own tactical headquarters, each wing made up of three heavy bombardment groups, or squadrons, and modeled, despite the differences in vocabulary, on Bomber Command practice. The force was still very small at the start of 1943, partly because of the decision to take a large component of aircraft and crew to establish the Twelfth Air Force in the Mediterranean theater. Some 27,000 men and 1,072 aircraft were transferred at a critical point in the buildup of the offensive, leaving Eaker temporarily with just 27,000 men and 248 heavy bombers.** The diversion left the Eighth Air Force as little more than a skeleton. By April there were still only 250 heavy bombers, of which around half were serviceable at any one time, a reflection of the difficulty in establishing an effective supply organization and the need for extensive modification of the B-17s for actual combat conditions. Even by June 1943 the serviceability rates for heavy bomber units was little more than half.** In the second half of 1943, however, the Eighth Air Force began to expand rapidly, reaching its peak strength, like Bomber Command, in late 1944 and early 1945; see table 2.2 for the buildup of the Eighth Air Force.
