Among the many problems facing the Eighth Air Force in the first half of 1943, the issue of supply—everything from aircrew to spare parts—was the most pressing. For Bomber Command the logistics were straightforward.

A truck transport system was established that by the end of 1943 could move 1.5 million ton-miles each month. The seven principal storage depots covered an area of more than 9 million square feet.*” The most urgent need was for service personnel. In the late spring Arnold sent Major General Follett Bradley, inspector general of the Army Air Forces, to England to help organize an effective program to supply the trained manpower necessary to keep the Eighth Air Force flying. The “Bradley Plan” called for 190,000 personnel in the Service Command to match the planned size of the force, but the figures were always behind target in 1943, partly because around 88 percent of the air force had to be shipped across the Atlantic in competition with vital supplies for the Mediterranean and the buildup of forces for the eventual invasion of France.** By June 1943 five bomber groups had arrived in England without thei
