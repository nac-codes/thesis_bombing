ve been prepared for combat in the United States rather than rely on modification depots in England, which lacked the means to convert aircraft quickly.©° It took most of the year be- fore serviceability and replacement rates for American heavy bombers could keep more than half the air force flying. The Eighth Air Force also suffered from the absence of a large corps of trained officers and men from the prewar air force. Some senior airmen had combat experience from the First World War, but most younger officers had never had to fire a gun or drop a bomb in anger. Arnold acknowledged that with only 1,500 regular officers in 1941, spread worldwide a year later, “the experience level is very thin.”®! Tactical thinking about the conduct of long-range bomber operations was in its infancy and relied on learning from both the British and German experience. The large number of volunteers in the United States for service in the air force had not, unlike those in the RAF, witnessed the battles over northern France and southern England or seen what bombing might achieve. Eaker called them “sturdy amateurs,” not lacking in enthusiasm or courage, but not the equivalent of a highly trained peacetime force.®* Brigadier General Haywood Hansell, temporarily in command of the Eighth Bomber Command before Longfellow’s appointment (hitherto commander of the First Bombardment Wing), produced a report for Eaker in February 1943 suggesting that the force was simply not ready yet for a major offensive against Germany. Hansell added that for the following months crews should be asked to undertake shallow attacks against German targets to keep losses to a minimum and to practice with the new target-finding apparatus, Oboe and H2S, taken over from the RAF.©? Nevertheless, the pressure on the command to show that it could produce results made it difficult for Eaker to limit what was done, even when the early raids sustained high losses and resulted in extensive combat fatigue.
