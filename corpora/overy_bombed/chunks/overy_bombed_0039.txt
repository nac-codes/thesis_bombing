mand to show that it could produce results made it difficult for Eaker to limit what was done, even when the early raids sustained high losses and resulted in extensive combat fatigue. Between January and April the monthly loss rate averaged almost 7 percent, too high a figure for such a small force.* The slow expansion of the bomber units meant that crews arriving together from the United States might be broken up to fill the losses in existing groups.

The relationship with the air force suffered from the instinctive sense of competition between the Eighth and Bomber Command, since they were the only servicemen actively in battle against the German homeland.
