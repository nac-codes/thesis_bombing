cent of the American airmen had actually visited a British home.®® The Eighth Air Force set up a speakers’ long apprenticeship and unredeemed promises from the American air force. Harris and Portal both pressed Eaker to collaborate more fully in the renewed offensive in the spring of 1943, though both well knew that Bomber Command had taken three years to reach its current size and capability. There were British complaints about the quality of the B-17 Flying Fortress as a daylight bomber and arguments over the effectiveness of the new American oil-based incendiary bomb, the six-pound M-69. British tests suggested that the new bomb lacked penetration, had an unreliable fuse, and suffered from relatively low incendiary efficiency, and despite American objections to the test results, the RAF continued to use the standard four-pound incendiary.”° There were strong objections to the British view of the B-17, but the American judgment on the bombers currently employed also accepted that the two main bombers, the Flying Fortress and the B-24 Liberator, were rapidly reaching the end of their useful life.“ Indeed, the harshest criticism of Eighth Air Force performance came from the American side, not from the RAF. Arnold, whose health deteriorated badly during 1943, finally lost patience with Eaker’s force in June 1943. Citing the number of aircraft already sent to Britain, Arnold telegraphed Eaker that the number of bombers sent out on each mission “is not rpt not satisfactory,” and told him bluntly to change his commanders and staff to find officers who could organize attacks in “a highly efficient manner.”  In the short correspondence that followed, Eaker was defensive about his force and resentful of Arnold’s intervention. Arnold ought certainly to have known better, since the ratio between aircraft supplied and aircraft on missions always had to take account of those awaiting repair, modification, or use for training purposes. “Neither of us,” Eaker replied, “has been
