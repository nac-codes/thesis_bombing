been developed using bright white markers when the ground was visible, or red, green, and yellow sky markers when it was not. The colorful flares were known by the code name Wanganui; the German public called them “Christmas trees.” Once at the target the new Mk XIV bombsight could be used even when the aircraft took evasive action.”8 Radio countermeasures were available to block the German Freya radar, code-named Mandrel, and to interfere with German ground-control transmissions, known as Tinsel, while new air- borne devices to warn of German night fighters and radar (“Monica” and “Boozer”) were finally being used, though again with only mixed effect.” All of these many technical and tactical innovations made Bomber Command a much more formidable threat. In a speech later in the war, Harris admitted to an army audience that the bomber offensive only started seriously in March 1943.82  The first major raid on the Ruhr was made on the night of March 5-6 against Essen. A force of 442 aircraft attacked with 1,014 tons of bombs, two-thirds of them incendiaries. The Pathfinders worked well and an estimated 75 percent bombed within three miles of the city center, which was the principal aiming point. The apparent success of the raid gave Harris his verb “to Essenise” the target, but the next raid on Essen was less successful, and a major raid on Duisburg on March 26-27 was scattered, largely because five out of nine of the Pathfinder Mosquito aircraft had to turn back with technical problems. A major raid on Berlin, conducted at Churchill’s suggestion, lost direction and hit the capital with only ten high-explosive bombs; the next raid missed the city altogether. Although the Ruhr plan was the first time Bomber Command had concentrated on a single coherent target, major raids were also made on more distant cities, reducing the impact on the Ruhr- Rhineland to no great effect. Attacks on Munich and Stuttgart recorded between one-fifth and one-third of bombs within three m
