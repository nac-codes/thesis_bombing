to control the whole night-defense system and a integrate with the existing system.*” Kammhuber’s insistence that his aerial fortification was the only way to combat the bombers brought him into conflict with Géring and his deputy, Erhard Milch, and in November he was finally relieved of his command and sent to run the rump Air Fleet 5 in Norway. In the midst of the campaign against the Ruhr, Harris was compelled to organize an operation of which he fundamentally disapproved. The engineer Barnes Wallis had begun work in 1940 on the kind of explosive device needed to breach a major dam wall. In March 1941 an Air Attack on Dams Committee was set up to study the possibility, using the Road Research Laboratory as a base. In April 1942, Wallis developed the idea of a cylindrical bomb, dropped from a low height, to bounce across the water and drop to the foot of the dam wall; code-named Upkeep, the bomb tests represented a real technical challenge but were convincing enough by February for the air staff to approve a possible operation against the German Méhne, Sorpe, and Eder dams.8® When the report was passed to Harris, he scrawled at the bottom, “This is tripe of the wildest description . .. not the smallest chance of it working.”®® Nevertheless, more trials were conducted to determine whether the “bouncing bomb” was a viable operational proposition. A squadron of Lancasters under Wing Commander Guy Gibson, no. 617 squadron, was activated on March 21, 1943, and trained rigorously for an operation against the reservoir dams that supplied water for the Ruhr. Harris remained adamantly unconvinced: “As I always thought,” he minuted in April, “the weapon is balmy [sic]... get some of these lunatics controlled or if possible locked up.”2° His skepticism was ignored. On the night of May 16-17, under the code name Operation Chastise, nineteen Lancasters were dispatched, of which twelve attacked the three dams, breaching the Méhne and the Eder, but doing only superficial damage
