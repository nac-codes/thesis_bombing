but were convincing enough by February for the air staff to approve a possible operation against the German Méhne, Sorpe, and Eder dams.®® When the report was passed to Harris, he scrawled at the bottom, “This is tripe of the wildest description . .. not the smallest chance of it working.”®* Nevertheless, more trials were conducted to determine whether the “bouncing naissance evidence on major raids showed that the percentage of hits within three miles varied from 80 percent to 25 percent, with most less than 50 percent.®? Harris assumed that “weaker brethren,” as he called them, were failing to press home attacks, while he singled out the tactic of violent evasive action (an instinctive response to intense searchlight and antiaircraft activity) as a key culprit. In early May 1943 he circulated a tactical memorandum to groups on “Evasive Action by Bombers” to replace existing instructions, which had given pilots advice on what forms of evasion to take under different circumstances. The new memorandum insisted that most forms of evasion were “useless,” since an antiaircraft barrage was indiscriminate and inaccurate (a claim scarcely justified by the 1,496 bombers damaged by antiaircraft fire during the campaign). Evasion, the report continued, increased the chance of collision, kept bombers longer in the danger zone, and placed serious strain on the aircraft structure. Crews were told to fly “straight and level” through the target area to increase the concentration of bomb hits.22 Whether crews really did respond to the instruction, or whether the growing experience of the Pathfinders and the surviving pilots reduced losses and increased concentration, the major raids carried out between May and July against Cologne, Duisburg, and Wup- vertal-Barmen resulted in the most destructive and lethal attacks so far.
