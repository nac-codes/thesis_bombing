he four months of the heavy “crash raids,” as they were called, an estimated 22,200 were killed, almost twice the number killed in the whole period since May 1940. Some 55,700 buildings were rendered for the moment uninhabitable. “They had ruined the Ruhr,” complained Hitler in June, though only 5 percent of buildings were actually destroyed.** The exact nature of the damage could not be known to Bomber Command, but intelligence estimates of the damage to the Ruhr were constructed in the summer to give Harris the necessary matériel to defend his city-bombing campaign. This was difficult to do and had to be based on extrapolation from the detailed statistical surveys of housing damage and man-hour losses in British cities bombed in 1941 and 1942. The Joint Intelligence Committee estimated that 9 percent of the population of the most heavily raided cities were homeless (422,500) and 38.5 percent (1,816,000) had housing damage. The committee estimated that 68,750 houses had been destroyed, a figure closer to the reality than might be expected from simple photoreconnaissance. Estimating the impact on the economy was more difficult.

Nevertheless, more trials were conducted to determine whether the “bouncing against the reservoir dams that supplied water for the Ruhr. Harris remained adamantly unconvinced: “As I always thought,” he minuted in April, “the weapon is balmy [sic] .. . get some of these on the aircraft structure. Crews were told to fly “straight and level” through the target area to increase the concentration of bomb hits.** Whether crews really did respond to the instruction, or whether 5 percent of buildings were actually destroyed.*4 The exact
