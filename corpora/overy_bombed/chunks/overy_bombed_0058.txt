evel” through the target area to increase the concentration of bomb hits.** Whether crews really did respond to the instruction, or whether 5 percent of buildings were actually destroyed.*4 The exact nature of the damage could not be known to Bomber Command, but intelligence estimates of the damage to the Ruhr were constructed in photoreconnaissance. Estimating the impact on the economy was more difficult. The Krupp works in Essen were thought to have lost between one-quarter and one-half of planned output over the summer. The MEW estimated a total loss to German production of 10-12 percent from attacks on the Ruhr-Rhineland (including 2-2.5 million tons of steel) and a bad state of morale.” A study by the RE8 department two months later of the impact of the raids on Essen, based on studies of British workers during the Baedeker raids on historic British cities in the spring of 1942, concluded that if German workers reacted in the same way as British workers to the loss of housing and amenities, then Essen lost the equivalent of fifty city-days of work. None of these efforts at calculating what Bomber Command was achieving were coordinated or consistent. Nor could they confirm whether bombing was a strategically sensible use of British resources.*® Alongside the night bombing, the Eighth Air Force, as one senior American commander put it, “can only nibble at the fringes of German strength.”*” There were three small raids on German territory in March; one in April (a mission to Bremen that cost the loss of 15 percent of the force); six attacks on the north German coast in May; and three in June, including the only attack on the Ruhr, against the synthetic rubber plant at Hiils on June 22, where the loss rate was almost 9 percent.*® The two forces were at quite different stages. In the first six months of 1943, Bomber Command dropped 63,000 tons of bombs, the Eighth Air Force only 8,400 more. For the American command, Operation Pointblank had not yet started; in contr
