he night bombing, the Eighth Air Force, as one senior American commander put it, “can only nibble at the fringes of German strength.”°” There were three small raids on German territory the synthetic rubber plant at Hiils on June 22, where the loss rate was almost 9 percent.®* The two forces were at quite different stages. In the first six months of 1943, Bomber Command dropped attack, “the whole of the effort should be confined to the congested city and housing areas North of the Elbe.” To get a clear picture of what saturation point might look like, the directorate used a map of central London as a model, placing transparencies with a typical incendiary bomb salvo printed on them over the London streets to work out how widely the bombs would spread and how vulnerable the buildings might be.1°° Over the winter of 1941-42 a great deal of effort went into working out how to create a major conflagration with the existing technology. In February 1942 a further memo- randum on choosing a German city to burn down had Hamburg at the top of the list, its vulnerability rated “outstanding.”°1 Harris might well have tried to exploit that vulnerability in May 1942 when he planned the first 1,000-bomber raid, but poor weather prevented it. Had he done so, Hamburg would certainly have sustained far less damage and loss of life than proved to be the case when Harris finally decided, on May 27, 1943, that it would suffer next what he was inflicting on the cities of the Ruhr-Rhineland. What resulted in a series of raids appositely titled Operation Gomorrah was the single largest loss of civilian life in one city throughout the whole European war, exceeded only by the 250,000 Japanese killed in the firebombing of Tokyo and the atomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The destruction of Hamburg in an uncontrollable firestorm on the night of July 27-28, 1943, is often presented as if it were an accident, the result of exceptional meteorological conditions and the failure of German def
