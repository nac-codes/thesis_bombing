Hamburg in an uncontrollable firestorm on the night of July 27-28, 1943, is often presented as if it were an accident, the result of exceptional meteorological conditions and the failure of German defenses, and not a product of deliberate intention. This is to misunderstand entirely the purpose of the city-bombing campaign, which was predicated from the start on causing as much general damage and loss of life as possible by means of large-scale fires. The firebombing of Hamburg was not exceptional. Not for nothing was its vulnerability rated “outstanding”; it was expected to burn well.  To understand the capacity of Bomber Command to inflict a conflagration of such intensity on Hamburg, it is useful to place it in the context of the long operational and scientific effort devoted by the Air Ministry to understanding how incendiarism worked. When the RE8 department was established in the summer of 1942, one of the first tasks given to it by the Air Ministry was research into the snread of fire and the role of wind sneeds in turning a strong hlaze inta a conflasration Tt was assiimed that city fires cold he acted 1mnan mitch as a nair af hellaws on a damestic hearth if the  Page 132 of 562 24% These last raids produced very heavy damage to the centers of the cities, and 1n the case of Barmen, attacked on the night of May 29-30 by 719 bombers, created a major conflagration that consumed summer.

It was assumed that city fires could be acted upon much as a pair of bellows on a domestic hearth if the wind speed and direction were favorable. “Once a large conflagration has become
