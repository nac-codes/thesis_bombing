conflagration. It was assumed that city fires could be acted upon much as a pair of bellows on a domestic hearth if the wind speed and direction were favorable. “Once a large conflagration has become established,” wrote one of the department’s scientific advisers, “the ‘fire-storm’ which it induces is sufficient to ensure its further spread.”!©2 On the advice of J. D. Bernal, wind trials were conducted by the Porton Down Experimental Station in Wiltshire using models of urban areas, while the RAF Photo-Interpretation Section provided night photographs to help in identifying the factors that accelerated the spread of fire.1° It was also necessary to determine scientifically the vulnerability to firebombs of German urban structures, in particular town houses and apartment blocks, and the quantity and mix of bombs necessary to overwhelm the fire services in a single raid. Work on German structures began in 1942 and was more or less complete by the time of the final RE8 report on “German Domestic Architecture” issued early in 1943. Tests on models of different kinds of German roofs were carried out at the Road Research Laboratory at Harmondsworth, outside London, while material on German staircases and stairwells was supplied from a German publication on “Residences and Houses of the Middle Classes.”1° The study of German architecture had involved a good deal of argument over the average thickness of wood beams and the penetrative power of the standard four-pound incendiary summer. The MEW estimated a total loss to German production of 10-12 percent from attacks on the Ruhr-Rhineland (including 2-2.5 million tons of steel) and a bad state of morale.2> A study by Alongside the night bombing, the Eighth Air Force, as one senior American commander put it, “can only nibble at the fringes of German strength.”®” There were three small raids on German territory randum on choosing a German city to burn down had Hamburg at the top of the list, its vulnerability rated “outstandi
