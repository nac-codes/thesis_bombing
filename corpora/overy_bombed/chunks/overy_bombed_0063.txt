It was also necessary to determine scientifically the vulnerability to firebombs of German Middle Classes.”% The study of German architecture had involved a good deal of argument over the average thickness of wood beams and the penetrative power of the standard four-pound incendiary bomb, which had only been resolved by recruiting émigré German architects, including the Bauhaus founder, Walter Gropius, to confirm the details of construction. The conclusion from studies of roof coverings, joists, and floor density typical of construction in northwestern Germany and Berlin was that “a German house will burn well.”2% The most important issue was to decide what mix and weight of bombs would best achieve a conflagration that was beyond the control of the ground defenses. The quantity of incendiary and high- explosive bombs judged to be necessary to destroy each square mile of the target city was cranked up regularly during the two years before Operation Gomorrah. Initial research suggested that between 100,000 and 200,000 four-pound bombs would swamp any fire-watching and firefighting force, but they had to be dropped in large salvos, not in small packets.1% By late 1942 incendiary technique was better understood. Its purpose, as one Air Ministry report put it, was “the complete destruction by fire of the built-up area of a city.” This required a fire-raising group to isolate the target and start fires pronounced enough for the follow-up force to drop 25,000 incendiaries for each square mile attacked as well as high-explosive bombs to destroy windows, crater the streets, and intimidate civil  Page 133 of 562 24% —_—wer ae OS after the Ruhr offensive “an organic
