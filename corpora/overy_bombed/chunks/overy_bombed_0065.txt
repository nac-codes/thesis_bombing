Igniting the “terraces of box-like buildings dating from the Middle Ages” was, according to the Bomber Directorate, expected to “yield good dividend.”1°2 To prevent effective firefighting, the incendiary load had to contain not only regular incendiaries but also the delayed-action explosive incendiary, capable of maiming or killing enemy civil defense workers and deterring them from action. These devices were deliberately timed to detonate at irregular intervals, some after three minutes, a small proportion only after ten. In late 1942 a small antipersonnel high-explosive bomb with a trigger fuse was developed, which could be activated by any object, even a jet of water, and would kill those immediately around it without warning.2% It was suggested that a high proportion of delayed-action bombs should be used in “incendiary attacks on virgin towns” to create a powerful deterrent effect on the enemy emergency services.112 There was also considerable argument about the merits of complementing the conventional magnesium bomb with larger oil-based incendiaries, which were also subjected to rigorous scientific testing. The result was the selection of the thirty-pound Mk II containing a mix of white phosphorus and benzol gel, capable of greater penetration than the four-pound incendiary, and effective in spreading fire quickly over a wider area.414 All of these bombs were eventually produced and used in substantial quantities over the last three years of the war, peaking in 1943 (see table 2.3).
