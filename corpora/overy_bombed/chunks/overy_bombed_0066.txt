These devices were deliberately timed to detonate at irregular intervals, some after three minutes, a small proportion only after ten.1% In late 1942 a small antipersonnel high-explosive bomb with a trigger fuse was developed, which could be activated by any object, even a jet of water, and would kill those immediately around it without warning.1™ It was suggested that a high proportion of delayed-action bombs should be used in “incendiary attacks on virgin towns” to create a powerful deterrent effect on the enemy emergency services.1!° There quickly over a wider area.14 All of these bombs were eventually produced and used in substantial quantities over the last three years of the war, peaking in 1943 (see table 2.3).
