There was strong Amer. terest in the development of incendiary bombing. The conventional view that the Eighth Air Force used predominantly high-explosive bombs for precision air attacks in contrast to the fire-raising tactics of Bomber Command is not borne out by the evidence. The Bomber Directorate in the Air Ministry collaborated closely with the American Office of Scientific Research and Development, which produced studies on the “Theory and Practice of Incendiary Bombing” and supplied the British with illustrated volumes on major conflagrations in American cities, which were more common and more destructive than in Europe. The photographs resemble closely the aftermath of the major city bombing in Germany.” In December 194 ‘a’s foremost expert on fire in foreign countries, Boris Laiming, filed a report that was passed on to the Air Ministry in December 1942.
