Horatio Bond, chief engineer of the National Fire Protection Association, visited London for four months in late 1942 to give advice targets for the Eighth Air Force Operational Research Section, to show what proportion and what type of incendiary bomb should be carried by aircraft. portions of cities and towns” to cr
