Extensive plans were laid in 1942 for incendiary bomb production, 39 million bomb cases in that year, 107 million in 1943, divided between the different services and Lend-Lease supplies for Britain!” Extensive research on the effects of incendiary bombing resulted in a set of recommendations for the Eighth Air Force in September 1942, which differed from RAF practice principally by preferring the 473-pound oil bomb over the 4-pound incendiary and identifying weather as a vital condition: “A high wind is still the best weapon.” Bomb patterns were to be dense enough “to guarantee real conflagrations.”118 Extensive experiments were carried out in Britain on the use of oil bombs of different weights, and in April large quantities were finally shipped to American bases for operational use. They were first employed extensively in July 1943, the month of Operation Gomorrah. By the end of the war the Eighth Air Force had dropped a total of 90,357 tons of incendiaries and incendiary clusters, totaling 27 million 4-pound bombs and 795,000 heavy incendiaries.1!* The two-thirds load of incendiary bombs aimed at the residential areas in Hamburg north of the river Elbe to try to stimulate an uncontrollable conflagration was thus no accident. The choice of Hamburg is not difficult to explain. The Air Ministry Target Committee in April 1943 defined Hamburg as “No. 1 priority” because of its shipbuilding industry.1*° It had been attacked repeatedly since 1940, usually in s
