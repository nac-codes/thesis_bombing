, 39 million bomb cases in that year, 107 million in 1943, divided between the different services and Lend-Lease supplies for Britain.1*” Extensive research on the Hamburg is not difficult to explain. The Air Ministry Target Committee in April 1943 defined Hamburg as “No. 1 priority” because of its shipbuilding industry.12° It had been attacked repeatedly since in just 142 deaths and the destruction of 220 buildings.124 Hamburg was fourth on the MEW list, behind Berlin, Duisburg, and Bochum, all three of which had been attacked in the late spring. The MEW rankings in the “Bomber’s Baedeker” had twenty-one industrial targets ranked 1+ or 1 and twenty-five ranked 2, substantially more than most other cities.122 The vulnerability of Hamburg was magnified by its proximity to British bases, the conspicuous coastline, and its sheer size. In a survey of German cities already subject to incendiary attack, the ratio of incendiary to high-explosive damage in Hamburg was judged to have been 13:1, higher than any other except the nearer port of Wilhelmshaven.1”? It is not clear whether Harris was ever shown these figures, but his desire to launch a spectacular operation fitted with the geographical pattern of the new attacks and Air Ministry ambitions. Not to have attacked Hamburg in force would have been more difficult to explain. The decision was nevertheless not easily endorsed and rested in the end on Churchill’s approval. The chief argument concerned the decision of whether to use a simple tactical device to temporarily blind all German radar, known by the code name Window. The tactic consisted of dropping very large quantities of small aluminized strips that would create a confused blur of echoes on enemy radar screens and make accurate detection of the bomber stream impossible. It was first developed in late 1941 by Robert Cockburn at the Telecommunications Research Establishment in Malvern, and early trials led to the manufacture of the material with a view to using it
