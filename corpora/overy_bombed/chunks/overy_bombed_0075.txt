Extensive research on the over the 4-pound incendiary and identifying weather as a vital condition: “A high wind is still the best weapon.” Bomb patterns were to be dense enough “to guarantee real conflagrations.”!48 Extensive 4-pound bombs and 795,000 heavy incendiaries.1!% Hamburg is not difficult to explain. The Air Ministry Target Committee in April 1943 defined Hamburg as “No. 1 priority” because of its shipbuilding industry.1”° It had been attacked repeatedly since damage in Hamburg was judged to have been 13:1, higher than any other except the nearer port of Wilhelmshaven.12? It is not clear whether Harris was ever shown these figures, but his desire to could be found. The Germans did develop the same technique, known as Diippel, but, like the RAF, hesitated to develop and use it. However, by late 1942 new British AI radar for night fighters and GCI (ground-controlled interception) radar for ground control, together with a new American airborne radar, SCR-270, all had the capacity to survive a Window assault. American experiments also showed that maximum effect would come from a large number of narrow strips, about half as long as the wavelength of the German Wiirzburg radar, which controlled the German air defenses. Window was manufactured in 30-centimeter (12-inch) strips, 1.5 centimeters (0.6 inch) wide, with paper on one side and aluminum foil on the other, in bundles of 2,000 for release from each aircraft in the bomber  stream.124  The combination of improved British defenses and the weakness of the German bomber arm in the west finally persuaded Portal to approve the employment of Window, but now the chiefs of staff objected to its operational use before the invasion of Sicily in early July, in case the German Air Force used it to confuse Allied air support during the landing. As a result its use was postponed until Operation Gomorrah, following approval by Churchill on July 15.122 A few days later Churchill was faced with
