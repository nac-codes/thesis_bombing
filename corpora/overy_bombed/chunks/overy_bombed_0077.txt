Churchill took this for approval.12° By then the first of the Gom- orrah raids had already taken place.  The operation against Hamburg, like the heavy bombing of Cologne in late June and early July, was spread over ten days from the first RAF raid on July 24-25 to the final raid on August 2-3.12? The opening night-bombing raid by 728 aircraft was the first to use Window. Around eighty miles from the target the Pathfinder Force and the main force that followed emptied bundles of foil strips at the rate of one bundle a minute. The strips worked perfectly, creating numerous echoes on the cathode-ray radar screens and presenting German night fighters with a confusion of false information. Searchlights and antiaircraft artillery had to improvise a barrage of light and fire in the hope that bombers might be deterred anyway. In just under one hour 2,284 tons of bombs were dropped, including an average of 17,000 incendiaries for every square kilometer.!?8 Although fewer than 50 percent of the bombers hit the three-mile aiming zone, the rest hit the large central and northwestern residential districts, killing, according to the Reich Statistical Office, 10,289 people, three times more than the worst raid so far.122 Over the following two days the Eighth Air Force attacked targets by day in northwest Germany.
