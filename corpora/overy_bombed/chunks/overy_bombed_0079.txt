humidity and high temperatures remained over the following two days. These summertime condi- tions favored the chances of a major conflagration.124 The Pathfinder Force dropped markers several miles east of the center of Hamburg, but the 729 aircraft concentrated their 2,326 tons well on the packed working-class districts of Hammerbrook, Borgfelde, Hamm, Billwerder, Hohenfelde, and Rothenburgsort. The raid lasted just over an hour. The concentration of approximately 1,200 tons of incendiaries on an area of two square miles created numerous major fires that soon merged together into a roaring inferno. Water shortages caused by the earlier heavy raid hampered firefighting. Many emergency workers and vehicles were farther west in the city still coping with the aftermath of the first fires where the civil defense control room had been destroyed. Efforts to stem the fires proved useless. What followed, in the words of Hamburg’s police president, was a “hurricane of fire . .. against which all human resistance seemed vain.”!22 The illusion of a hurricane was caused by the scale and intense heat of the conflagration, which caused fire winds that drove the flames across natural firebreaks. The inferno created a pillar of hot air and debris that rose quickly to a height of more than two miles above the city. Greedy for more oxygen, the fire drew in cold air from the surrounding area with such force that the new winds reached hurricane-force strength in the area of the fire, collapsing buildings, uprooting trees, and sucking human bodies into the flames where they were swiftly incinerated or mummified. Acting like giant bellows, the winds created temperatures in excess of 800°C that destroyed everything combustible barring brick and stone. Oxygen was sucked out of the thousands of basement and cellar shelters, leaving their inhabitants to die slowly of carbon monoxide poisoning./#? An estimated 18,474 people died during the night. An area of more than twelve square miles was
