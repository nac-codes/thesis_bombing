for the German air defense system were profound. The catastrophe at Hamburg even more than the raids on the Ruhr catapulted the German Air Force into abandoning the principle of the fixed front, embodied in the Kammhuber Line and heavy reliance on antiaircraft fire, and substituting instead a much larger fighter force based on new forms of combat. Even before the conflagration at Hamburg, Goring, despite his anxiety to begin offensive air operations against Britain, admitted to his staff that “air defense is now in my opinion decisive.” The terrible events in Hamburg accelerated the shift to priority for fighter production and intense efforts to combat the scientific lead in radar and radio countermeasures that the Allied air force had established over the summer months.1#° By October, Géring’s deputy, Erhard Milch, had drawn up firm plans for the output of more than 3,000 fighter aircraft a month, and more speculative plans for 5,000 fighters every month during 1945, at the expense of further bomber production.1” By simplifying production methods, reducing the large number of aircraft types, and abandoning the habit of regular modification, Milch calculated that the output could be achieved without a large increase in labor.128 He had already taken over central responsibility for radar and radio development in May and had begun an immediate acceleration of research and production. In July a new office for high-frequency research was set up under Dr. Hans Plendl, which drew in 3,000 scientific personnel to combat the variety of devices that had fallen into German hands during the Ruhr battle, thanks to the recovery of equipment from crashed bombers.12%  Page 141 of 562 25% a A A Hamburg, with the loss of a further 18 aircraft, a rate over the two days of more than 10 percent, an indication that the warnings about the dangers of daytime bombing voiced at Casablanca had not been misplaced. The two American raids killed 468 people in Hamburg.122 eee eee eee eee —ee— ee
