wing the final heavy raid on Hamburg, July 30, the Zahme Sau tactic of controlled infiltration of the bomber stream was approved by Milch and Hubert Weise, overall commander of the German home-front air defense. The result was a substantial diversion of guns and aircraft away from the fighting fronts where they were needed more than ever by the summer of 1943. By late August there were over 1,000 fighter aircraft stationed in Germany, 45.5 percent of all German fighter strength, and a further 224 in northern France. Over the same period the number of heavy antiaircraft guns on the home front increased from 4,800 before Gomorrah to over 6,000 by the end of August, including more of the heavier 105-millimeter and 128-millimeter models. Shortages of skilled personnel hampered the antiaircraft effort throughout the year, and for the first time substantial numbers of women and young people were recruited as Flakhelfer; on Hitler’s orders training began in August 1943 for 250 units of Reich Labor Service boys to undertake air defense duty in the year before they joined the armed forces.1*°  In Britain the Hamburg raids were treated as a great success. The director of intelligence in the Air Ministry thought that the operation confirmed the superiority of incendiary over high-explosive bombs: “The complete wipe-out of a residential area by fire is quite another and better conception. May it long continue!”!4! Robert Lovett wrote to Eaker from Washington that the War Department was keen to see the photoreconnaissance images of Hamburg’s destruction as soon as possible: “The pasting Hamburg got must have been terrific.” Eaker replied that the raids had “a tremendous effect.”142 For Harris, Operation Gomorrah was more than he could have hoped for. The post-raid assessments, now based on RE8 research on man-months lost and acreage destroyed, transformed the statistical image of Bomber Command’s achievements and gave Harris the weapons he needed to argue the case that bombing w
