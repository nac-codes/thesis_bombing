Command headquarters used this material to present a statistical way of measuring success based on the following three criteria:  war effort or on the state of mind of those bombed. The MEW warned the Air Ministry that it was hard to judge German conditions. They estimated that Operation Gomorrah had cost Hamburg the equivalent of 1.25 million man-months, or 12 percent of the city’s annual production. The cumulative effect of all Bomber Command’s attacks during the late spring and summer was estimated at a more modest 3 percent of Germany’s potential production effort.4° Evidence soon became available to show that the damage was not as crippling as had at first been hoped. The port of Hamburg, which had been less severely damaged than the city, was estimated by MEW to be operating at 70 percent of its capacity again by the end of August; intelligence on the Blohm & Voss shipyards, one of the principal targets for the Eighth Air Force, suggested that they had not been destroyed and were still functioning.1#” By November the city was back to 80 percent of its pre-raid output. When Goring was captured at the end of the war with a train full of possessions, the American army found among them a presentation folio of more than a hundred charts and graphs on the remarkable recovery of Hamburg.1“8 The one statistic that could only be guessed at was the number of dead. This was not a measurement used by Bomber Command, whose calculations of “effort,” “efficiency,” and “success” became increasingly more abstract as the war went on. The acreage destroyed was released to the British press as early as August 6, though the RAF communiqué emphasized that the damage “particularly covers the principal manufacturing districts and the docks and wharves.”442 Sources in Sweden suggested the figure of 58,000 dead, which was reprinted in British newspapers later in August. News of the firestorm became available from a correspondent of the Swiss paper Basler Nachrichten only in November 1
