fire of the B-17s, though in common with almost all air-to-air engagements, American aircrew claimed to have shot down a remarkable 288 enemy aircraft.1®* In September a raid on Stuttgart, undertaken while Arnold was visiting Britain, saw the loss of 65 bombers (19 percent) out of a force of 338, with little damage to the city itself.  The Eighth Bomber Command nursed its wounds for more than a month before beginning a new series of deep-penetration attacks in October. A raid on the coastal city of Anklam on October 9 cost 18 bombers out of a force of 106, but the most famous battle of the bomber war took place during a second raid on Schweinfurt on October 14, when 65 bombers were lost out of an attacking force of 229, a total loss rate of over 28 percent of the force. Fighters accompanied the aircraft as far as Aachen, thanks to the addition of extra fuel tanks, which pushed their range to 350 miles, but after that the bomber stream was subjected to hundreds of attacks with rocket and cannon fire from enemy fighters. Eaker wrote to Arnold after the raid, “This does not represent disaster; it does indicate that the air battle has reached its climax.”!® But so severe was the risk on any raid past fighter cover that for the next four months operations were only carried out with increasing numbers of bombers on cities within easy range. As a result, Kiel, Bremen, Wilhelmshaven, and Emden—already the victims of the first year of Bomber Command raids thanks to their proximity—became the recipients of occasional heavy bombing, while the majority of American attacks now took place once again over France. The Eighth Air Force, like the German Air Force and Bomber Command years before, began to think about the possibility of night attacks, and in September 90 B-17s were converted for practice and training in night flying.1® In three months of raiding, the Eighth Bomber Command lost 358 B-17s in combat, suffering the highest loss rate of the war in October.
