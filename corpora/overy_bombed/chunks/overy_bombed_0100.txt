The raid by 560 aircraft dropped 1,800 tons mainly of high explosive on the research stations and accommodations (also killing 500 Polish forced laborers in a nearby labor camp). Extensive damage was done to the rocket research program in one of the few “precision” raids attempted by the command in 1943, but 40 aircraft were shot down, a loss rate of 6.7 percent.
