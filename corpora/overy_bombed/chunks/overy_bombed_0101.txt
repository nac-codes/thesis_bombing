Pilot strength was 2,415 in June, 2,403 in December.*®? On August 17-18, Harris was ordered to mount a more precise attack on the German Air Force research station on rons that the third attack, on September 3-4, was made only with Lancasters, but not only did the H2S marking once again miss the main aiming point, but 7 percent of the Lancaster force was lost. The first “Battle of Berlin” petered out until November in favor of less dangerous targets.1®8 On the night of October 22-23 a second firestorm was created in the small city of Kassel, where H2S marking was for once accurate. The raid report noted that the whole city area “was virtually devastated.”1£ The death of an estimated 6,000 people was a higher percentage of the city population than in Ham- burg. Some 59 percent of Kassel was burnt out and 6,636 residential buildings destroyed. Armaments production was hit heavily by the destruction of the workers’ quarters, but like Hamburg’s it revived after two or three months to around 90 percent of the pre-raid level.1”° The raid put Kassel for the moment at the top of Bomber Command’s list of the proportion of city buildings destroyed or damaged, ahead of Hamburg, 58 percent to 51 percent.1”4 But Bomber Command lost 43 aircraft, 7.6 percent of the force, a steady attrition of its strength.
