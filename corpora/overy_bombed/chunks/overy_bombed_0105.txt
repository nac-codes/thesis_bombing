here H2S marking was for once accurate. The raid report noted that the whole city area “was virtually devastated.”!°° The death of an estimated 6,000 people was a higher percentage of the city population than in Ham- damaged, ahead of Hamburg, 58 percent to 51 percent.!”4 But Bomber Command lost 43 aircraft, 7.6 percent of the force, a steady attrition of its strength. Over the course of 1943 the command lost not collapse over the winter, the public would think “our ‘full-out’ offensive doesn’t work.”}” A paper prepared for Portal in October argued that a failure to demonstrate what strategic bombing could do would have “dangerous repercussions upon post-war policy.””4 Both forces wanted the other to help more in pursuit of what was seldom a common ambition. In October, Portal told Eaker and principal cities associated with fighter production.17> it on less important targets.1”” When RE8 researchers suggested that Bomber Command attacks had by their estimate actually done little more than reduce German economic potential by 9 percent in 1943 (even this figure turned out after the war to have been overoptimistic), Harris responded angrily that in the cities his force had devastated the proportion must self-evidently be higher. Even this devastation, as the Air Ministry reminded him, had affected only 11 percent of the whole German population, but Harris was a figure difficult to gainsay even over an issue of real strategic signifi- cance.178 He stuck to area bombing in preference to selected targets and as a result made Pointblank harder to achieve, while paradoxically contributing to the stalemate he was trying to break. While the two forces argued over priorities, the greatest battles of the bomber war were being played out in the skies over Germany. In all cases the majority of bombers succeeded in carrying out their bombing mission; there was never a point when the bomber did not get through. Although the bomb loads were often spread over areas widely distant fro
