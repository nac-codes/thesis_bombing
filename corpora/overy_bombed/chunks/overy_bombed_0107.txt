At this stage of the war the problems facing both sides, though they were supported by increasingly sophisticated scientific and technical equipment and weaponry, remained the same as they had been since the onset of the bombing war in 1940: weather conditions, bombing accuracy, the balance between defensive and offensive tactics, operational organization, and force morale. These factors profoundly affected what the two bomber com- mands were capable of achieving. In an age where radar aids to navigation and electronic guidance systems were in their infancy, weather continued to play an arbitrary and intrusive role in the conduct of air warfare. The final United States Bombing Survey report on weather effects regarded them as “a major controlling factor” in the operation of Allied bomber forces. For the Eighth Air Force, which relied more on visual bombing, weather prevented any operations for a quarter of the time, while 10 percent of all aircraft that did take off aborted because of weather conditions. It was calculated from unit records that the operational rate of the Eighth Air Force was only 55 percent of the potential effort because of the effects of northern Europe’s rainy climate. Low cloud and fog were the main culprits.1”° Calculations by the Army Air Forces’ director of weather in late 1942 found that the average number of days per month when the sky over the target was absolutely clear was 1 or 2 in the winter months, risin
