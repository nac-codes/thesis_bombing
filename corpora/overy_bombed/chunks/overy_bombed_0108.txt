ations by the Army Air Forces’ director of weather in late 1942 found that the average number of days per month when the sky over the target was absolutely clear was 1 or 2 in the winter months, rising to a peak of 7 in June, a total of 31 days in the year. Days when the major limiting factors of high wind, ice, or more than three-tenths cloud cover were absent were more numerous, but still numbered only 113 out of the year, again with a low of 6 in the winter months and a peak of 12 in June.1®° The air force weather service developed a sophisticated pattern of weather prediction, based on the experience  Page 152 of 562 27% damaged, ahead of Hamburg, 58 percent to 51 percent.121 But Bomber Command lost 43 aircraft, 7.6 percent of the force, a steady attrition of its strength. Over the course of 1943 the command lost 4,026 aircraft, 2,823 in combat.1”2 not collapse over the winter, the public would think “our ‘full-out’ offensive doesn’t work.”!” A paper prepared for Portal in October argued that a failure to demonstrate what strategic bombing could do would have “dangerous repercussions upon post-war policy.”2”4 Both forces wanted the other to help more in pursuit of what was seldom a common ambition. In October, Portal told Eaker and it on less important targets.1”” When RES8 researchers suggested that Bomber Command attacks had by their estimate actually done little more than reduce German economic potential by 9 percent operational rate of the Eighth Air Force was only 55 percent of the potential effort because of the effects of northern Europe’s rainy climate. Low cloud and fog were the main culprits.” Calculations by the Army Air Forces’ director of weather in late 1942 found that the average number of days per month when the sky over the target was absolutely clear was 1 or 2 in the winter months, rising toa of the burgeoning civilian airline business in the 1930s, providing regular climate data, forecasts of current weather trends, and a precise operational
