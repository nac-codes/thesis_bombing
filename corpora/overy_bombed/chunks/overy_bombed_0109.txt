ar was 1 or 2 in the winter months, rising toa of the burgeoning civilian airline business in the 1930s, providing regular climate data, forecasts of current weather trends, and a precise operational forecast for particular missions.1®4 Even with reasonably accurate forecasting, weather conditions could alter rapidly and unexpectedly. The combat diary of the 305th Bombardment Group in 1942-43 can be taken as an example: November 23, Lorient “covered by cloud”; December 12, Lille, “cloud cover at the target”; January 23, Brest “obscured by the cloud cover”; February 4, Emden, “no bombs were dropped due to the clouds”; and so on.182  Bomber Command was less affected by the weather because area bombing could be carried out in weather conditions that were less than ideal, but British experience also showed that “average good visibility” was only available between five and nine nights in the summer months and three to five during the winter.1® To the end of the war, Harris continued to cite the weather as a principal explanation for why Bomber Command could not switch to attacks on precise target systems.1®4 With the arrival of electronic aids to navigation, bombing could be carried out through cloud and smoke, though the return to a base suddenly shrouded in fog caused regular accidents. Weather did make severe demands on pilots as they struggled at night to cope with the elements, as the follow- ing recollection of the last night of Operation Gomorrah illustrates:  We set course north to the targets and flew into thunderstorms resulting in heavy icing. We could hear the ice breaking off the sides of the aeroplane and the propellers, and then we were principal cities associated with fighter production1> operational rate of the Eighth Air Force was only 55 percent of the potential effort because of the effects of northern Europe’s rainy climate. Low cloud and fog were the main culprits.1” Calculations by the Army Air Forces’ director of weather in late 1942 found that th
