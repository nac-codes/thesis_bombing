ential effort because of the effects of northern Europe’s rainy climate. Low cloud and fog were the main culprits.1” Calculations by the Army Air Forces’ director of weather in late 1942 found that the average number of days per month when the sky over the target was absolutely clear was 1 or 2 inthe winter months, rising toa of the burgeoning civilian airline business in the 1930s, providing regular climate data, forecasts of current weather trends, and a precise operational forecast for particular missions.1®!

The aeroplane by this stage was completely out of control with icing ...a very frightening experience. On this occasion pilot and crew survived.1®>  Of all the problems posed by the generally poor weather conditions over Germany, maintaining adequate levels of bombing accuracy was the most significant. For the Eighth Air Force, clear weather was essential if precise targeting was to survive. In ideal conditions the early raids on France showed an average error range of 1,000 yards, but conditions were seldom ideal. An investigation carried out in February 1943 highlighted problems of poor accuracy and, alongside weather and enemy defenses, blamed poor onboard teamwork and inexperienced pilots. It was found that the method of bombing in squadron (or group) formation reduced accuracy substantially for the last formations to bomb because of the smoke and fire on the ground; up to July 1943 an average of only 13.6 percent of bombs fell within 1,000 feet of the aiming point, but for the last formation to bomb the figure fell to only 5 percent.1®° Anderson pressed his commanders to focus all their efforts on putting more  Wa Wo A ett te a nk ere te ta te a 2 te et a a te LR a tee 2 tee 2 te  Page 153 of 562 27% 113 out of the year, again with a low of 6
