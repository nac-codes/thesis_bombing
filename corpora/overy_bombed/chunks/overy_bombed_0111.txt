The American offensive began without a Pathfinder Force and no electronic aids to navigation. In March 1943, Eaker had asked Portal to supply both the Oboe and H2S equipment for use by the American formation leaders. Portal offered equipment for only eight aircraft and training facilities for the crews. By the early autumn there were three Pathfinder units forming, one with H2S, two with the American version of the technology, known as H2X.188 Eaker found the temptation irresistible to use the new guidance system to allow bombing when the target was obscured. In September 1943 the Eighth Air Force undertook its first deliberate blind-bombing attack on the German port of Emden. The bombing was scattered around Emden and the surrounding region, but the fact that it was now possible to arrive over the area of the target in poor weather introduced the American air forces to area bombing. Escalation in this case was dictated by the technical impossibility of bombing accurately for more than a few days a month. From September 1943 onward, American bombers were directed to attack city areas through cloud in the hope that this would hit the precise targets obscured by the
