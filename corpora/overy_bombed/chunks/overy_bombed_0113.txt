n when visibility was good, and less discriminate attacks when visual conditions were poor.!2! The result, as with Bomber Command, was to increase the number of German civilians killed and houses destroyed by American bombers, which now carried much higher incendiary loads for blind-bombing raids. Even precision bombing resulted in widespread damage to the surrounding civilian area. The USAAF in-house history of radar bombing was more candid than the public image: “Neither visual nor radar bombing ever achieved pin-point bombing; both methods were, in effect, methods of area bombing in the sense that a certain percentage of bombs fell within an area of a certain size, the rest falling without.”122 The problem for Bomber Command was different. Here unacceptably inaccurate bombing had to be improved to achieve higher concentrations on the chosen urban areas. The introduction of Oboe and H2S contributed to raising the average accuracy of the attacking force, but concentration could be lost if the weather deteriorated or the Pathfinder Force missed the aiming point, or German or the burgeoning Clvillan airline Dusiness 1n the 175Us, providing regular Climate data, rorecasts of current weather trends, and a precise Operational forecast for particular missions.~™~ Even with Lorient “covered by cloud”; December 12, Lille, “cloud cover at the target”; January 23, Brest “obscured by the cloud cover”; February 4, Emden, “no bombs were dropped due to the clouds”; and so on.1&2 explanation for why Bomber Command could not switch to attacks on precise target systems.1® With the arrival of electronic aids to navigation, bombing could be carried out through cloud and bombs “on the critical points of the targets.” “It is evident,” he continued, “that our bombing is still not up to the standards that it can be.”!®” Cloud, industrial haze, and smoke screens made this on industrial centers or, increasingly, as “marshaling yards.”1®° The distinction for most, though not all, American r
