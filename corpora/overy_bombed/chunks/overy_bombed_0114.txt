The result, as with Bomber Command, was to increase the number of German civilians killed and houses destroyed by American bombers, which now carried much higher incendiary of a certain size, the rest falling without.”2°? decoys were successful in diverting a proportion of the attacking force. In raids using Oboe in 1943, the number of aircraft that bombed within three miles of the target ranged from 77 percent against Cologne in July to 32 percent against Bochum in September, but poor weather prevented evaluation of at least half the raids. Oboe certainly proved to be the more successful of the two methods but could only reach as far as the Ruhr-Rhineland. For H2S operations the scale of accuracy was even longer: 86 percent against Kassel in October to 2.1 percent against Berlin on August 31. The average for the twenty-three H2S raids that could be plotted was 32 percent, a substantial improvement on the Butt Report evidence, but still a low level of concentration.1®3 Research on the first large-scale blind-bombing raid using H2S in poor weather, against Mannheim-Ludwigshafen on November 17-18, estimated that perhaps 60 percent of the attacking aircraft had hit the conurbation itself. These figures indicated that the force had at last adopted a technology and tactics that might reduce the amount of wasted effort. This was partly due to the additional training for Pathfinder navigators organized by the Bombing Development Unit, set up in late 1942, consisting of flights over British cities. These simulated raids showed wide deviation from the putative aiming point, but an average of 50 percent of “hits” within a three-mile radius (four miles for London). The trials showed
