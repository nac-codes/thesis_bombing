ome of the war’s most sophisticated equipment. For both air forces the pre-raid preparation required all the conventional demands of battle—tactical, logistical, and technical; the intelligence and operational research reports had to be factored into each calculation and the weather closely monitored. Organizing a raid with hundreds of aircraft coordinated over long distances promised all kinds of hazards. Pilots had to create formations while avoiding accidents and to synchronize their flights with the escorting fighters as far as their range would allow. Along the target run and over the target itself there were precise instructions about combat, evasion, target recognition, heights, and speeds. On return there was the process of debriefing crews, coping with casualties, and estimating the outcome of the raid. Each battle was self-con- tained, but for commanders and their crews the campaign was continuous, more so than for almost any other form of combat over the four or five years of war.  The typical instructions for a Bomber Command raid illustrate the close attention to planning detail and the range of demands made of the crews. Aircraft from four or five bomber groups were  Page 156 of 562 28% of a certain size, the rest falling without.”222 for the twenty-three H2S raids that could be plotted was 32 percent, a substantial improvement on the Butt Report evidence, but still a low level of concentration.1*2 Research on the first large-scale given instructions about force size, composition of the bomb load, routes to the destination target (or for the decoy attacks), and the timing of each of five waves of attacking aircraft, which had to drop their bombs within a twenty-minute period to maximize impact. There were instructions on Window, on the Mandrel jammer, radar and wireless use, and the chosen target-marking pattern, which could be either ground marking with illuminating flares followed by red and/or green target indicators or sky marking with red and gree
