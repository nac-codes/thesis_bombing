r and wireless use, and the chosen target-marking pattern, which could be either ground marking with illuminating flares followed by red and/or green target indicators or sky marking with red and green star flares. The master bomber and the supporting Pathfinders had to drop their markers and repeat markers over an eleven-minute period, while the main force had to watch for the markers, bomb the center of them if they could, and then make for home. The whole combat force typically extended for twenty miles, was six miles wide, and flew in staggered formation, the highest aircraft some 4,000 feet above the lowest. Crews had to fly low over England, then climb to 14,000-15,000 feet, then increase speed and fly at 18,000-20,000 feet for bombing, finally falling away from the target zone to 12,000 feet, back to 18,000 feet for the return  flight across Germany, 12,000 feet again at the European coast, and not below 7,000 feet on crossing back over English territory. Then came the debriefing interviews and the post-raid assessments.12>  The Eighth Air Force derived a lot from British experience, but its typical raid preparations and combat showed an even greater awareness of the complexity of the task. The principles guiding target selection dwarfed the simple list of cities and their industrial importance given to Harris. Target selection involved assessing the strategic importance of a target, working out the degree of “cushion” in the economy for substituting or dispersing output, calculating the depth of a target system (how far away a product might be from frontline use), judging the recuperative possibilities of a target, and on industrial centers or, increasingly, as “marshaling yards.”1®2 The distinction for most, though not all, American raiding from British area bombing was intention. The civilian and the civilian milieu  of a certain size, the rest falling without.”22 for the twenty-three H2S raids that could be plotted was 32 percent, a substantial improvemen
