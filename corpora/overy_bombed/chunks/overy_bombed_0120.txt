e group, though Bomber Command accuracy was from the poor state of 1941, every second bomb was still miles from the aiming point.1** flight across Germany, 12,000 feet again at the European coast, and not below 7,000 feet on crossing back over English territory. Then came the debriefing interviews and the post-raid assessments.1%* the German equivalent. In the evenings they relaxed from their efforts by working out fruitless statistical teasers—“How many sheep are there in Bavaria?” “What is the most economical land route from Gdansk to Gibraltar?”!°? Their labors proved most effective with assessments of damage to capital-intensive targets such as oil refineries or synthetic oil and rubber producers. This material was before breaking into bombing formation in approach to the target. Separate briefings were then held for pilots and copilots (sixteen items), navigators and bombardiers (six items), gunners and radio operators (three items). Watches were then synchronized. At 8 a.m. on the morning of the operation a decision to go ahead or postpone had to be taken based on the current state of the weather. Com- manders had an obligation, according to a manual on tactics, “to work out each mission in minute detail. The struggle here is of the life and death variety.”1*°  Somehow or other all the detailed calculations, operating plans, and contingencies had to be mastered and put into effect by the expensively trained crews. There was always to be a gap between the ideal operation laid down by the military bureaucracy that ran the offensives and the reality of combat. Unanticipated factors of all kinds, not least the extent and combativeness of the enemy forces, undermined the best-laid operational procedures. Given the technical sophistication of much of the equipment, the large number of freshman crews to be initiated on each operation, and the vagaries of weather and navigation, it is perhaps surprising that bombing operations achieved as much as they did. Almost all
