Harris thought that among his crews only a quarter were effective bombers, the rest merely there to give German antiaircraft guns something to shoot at.2° Air force medical staff, on the other hand, found that there were very few records of cowardice, despite the popular fear among aircrew that they might be regarded that way if they broke down. In both the RAF and the Eighth Air Force it came to be recognized that regular air operations induced particular forms of neurosis that had little to do with a lack of spirit and everything to do with the harsh experiences of daily flying. Eighth Air Force was instructed to rest and rotate tired crews but to isolate those whose behavior might contaminate the efficiency of their unit. These cases were divided between the categories of “flying fatigue” and “lack of moral fibre.” To the former there was no stigma attached, but the latter were to be removed from flying status, stripped of their commission, and sent home in disgrace.2° Those who developed serious psychoneurotic symptoms were sent to special hospitals to undergo narcosis therapy, and many were subsequently returned to duty, including combat flying.
