of duty displayed “subjective anxiety” symptoms: “weight loss, insomnia, severe operational fa- tigue, and loss of efficiency.”243 These were the men sent by night and by day against German targets in the context of steadily increasing losses on the major raids. During 1943, Bomber Command lost 15,678 killed or prisoners of war, while the Eighth Air Force lost 9,497, almost all of them in missions against German targets.?!4 The escalating costs of the offensive presented the bomber commanders once again with questions about the strategic value of what they were doing. The reality of tactical stalemate coincided by chance with a revival of the hope, largely abandoned since 1941, that bombing might induce a social or political crisis so severe that it would critically undermine the German war effort. Though Harris saw area bombing chiefly as a form of economic attrition, he never entirely excluded the possibility that his bombing might provoke a political bonus, even to the point of German surrender, and he was happy to fuel such speculation if it strengthened his hand. Air Intelligence, for example, was impressed by his claim that the destruction of half the German urban area would provoke collapse, even if the Gestapo and the SS (Schutzstaffel) were determined to “prevent insurrection.”245 For some  manthe nolitical intelligence in Rritain ancauraced hv Garman difficultiac an the Saviat frant and in the Mediterranean had heen cuceacting that there micht hea nacitive anewer tn the anactioan “Will  Page 163 of 562 29% lying fatigue’ and lack of moral fibre.

By early 1944 it was found that around 3 percent of flying officers (of those wh
