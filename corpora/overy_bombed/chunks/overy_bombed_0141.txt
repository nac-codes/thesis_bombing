The most important issue he identified and emphasized was “supply long range fighter protection to help the B-17s.” He suggested designing built-in additional fuel tanks for American fighter aircraft but in the interim adding two wing tanks to the new P-51 Mustang fighter. He concluded, “This is a ‘must.””! The P-51 did not see long-range service over Germany until the spring of 1944, by which time other fighter aircraft converted to longer range were already in service to protect the American bombers part of the way to their targets.
