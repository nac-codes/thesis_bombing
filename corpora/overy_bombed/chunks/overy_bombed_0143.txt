t was belated recognition that even in a modern strategic air war, destruc- tion of the enemy air force and its resources rather than destruction of the enemy home front was the essential condition for eventual victory.  “The Arithmetic of Impending Ruin”  There has been since the war much discussion of why it took so long for the U.S. air forces to develop fighter aircraft with long-range capability able to contest air superiority over Germany.

The planners in 1941 who drew up AWPD-1 emphasized that the development of escort fighters that could fly as far as the bombers was “mandatory.”2 Arnold as early as February 1942 had asked for all new fighters to be developed with auxiliary tanks. In June 1943 he ordered a crash program to ensure that full bomber escort could be provided by early 1944.4 There was no shortage of high-quality fighter aircraft designed with longer range than the British Spitfire (which had supplied limited fighter escort in 1943). The Lockheed P-38 Lightning, a radical twin-engine, twin-boom fighter, was a prewar development that had long-range extra fuel tanks built into the design. Its development was delayed and it entered serv
