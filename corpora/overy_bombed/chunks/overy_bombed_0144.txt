Lockheed P-38 Lightning, a radical twin-engine, twin-boom fighter, was a prewar development that had long-range extra fuel tanks built into the design. Its development was delayed and it entered service in the summer of 1942; it was used in North Africa as a low-altitude battlefield aircraft, a role that suited it poorly. Late in 1943 two groups were allocated to the Eighth Air Force and at once extended potential escort range as far as Leipzig, though in numbers too small to transform the offensive, and with persistent technical problems with the engine. The mainstay of the Eighth Fighter Command in 1943 was the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, a high-performance fighter/fighter-bomber designed in 1940 around the Pratt and Whitney R-2800 radial engine. It could carry two external fuel tanks to boost range as far as the German frontier when drop tanks were first installed in July 1943, but little effort went into modifying the P-47 so that it could reach far into Germany. Eaker gave auxiliary tanks a low priority among his many other problems. Yet with larger tanks the P-47 could by the spring of 1944 fly as far as Hamburg, where before it had been confined to an arc that reached little farther than the Low Countries and the German border.* control of the Eighth Air Force in January 1944, “is to neutralize the German fighter opposition at the earliest possible moment.”2** planation for eventual victory in what Major General Frederick Anderson, Spaatz’s deputy from January 1944, called “the battle of Germany.”” emphasized that the development of escort fighters that could fly as far as the bombers was “mandatory.”? Arnold as early as February 1942 had asked for all new fighters to be developed with auxiliary The one aircraft that promised to transform the air war over Germany was the North American P-51 Mustang recommended by Lovett. Originally designed to meet a British requirement in 1940, it began service with the RAF (under the name Apache) in November 1941. British e
