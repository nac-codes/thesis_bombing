was the North American P-51 Mustang recommended by Lovett. Originally designed to meet a British requirement in 1940, it began service with the RAF (under the name Apache) in November 1941. British engineers fitted it with a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine and revolutionized its performance, increasing speed, rate of climb, and maneuverability. News reached Washington via the American embassy in London and Arnold immediately saw the aircraft’s potential. By November 1942 he had placed initial orders for 2,200, fitted with Merlin engines made under license in the United States.® Since the P-51 was supposed to fulfill British orders, Arnold had once again to renege on the agreement. After a stormy exchange with Portal in the late autumn of 1943, he got his way.? The P-51 entered service in early December 1943 with drop tanks that could take it 475 miles into Germany; when it finally came onstream in significant numbers in the spring of 1944 its range, with new tanks, could take it farther than Berlin and even as far as Vienna. Most accounts of the battle for air supremacy credit the P-51 with the destruction of German fighter defenses, but rather like accounts of the Battle of Britain, in which the Spitfire has always been privileged over the Hurricane, the sturdy and less glamorous P-47  Page 169 of 562 30% Thunderbolt bore the brunt of the first months of the Battle of Germany. On the day the P-51 was introduced to combat against targets in France, December 5, 1943, there were 266 P-47s but only thirty-six P-51s. Three months later, on the first deep daylight raid into Germany against Leipzig, there were 688 P-47s and just seventy-three P-51s. By the end of March 1944, the point that some his- torians have seen as the moment when air superiority passed to the Eighth Air Force, there were still more than twice as many Thunderbolts as Mustangs.® The explanation for the slow evolution of a long-range fighter capability lies not with the technology but with the Eighth Air Fo
