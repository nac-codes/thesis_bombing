e, there were still more than twice as many Thunderbolts as Mustangs.® The explanation for the slow evolution of a long-range fighter capability lies not with the technology but with the Eighth Air Force commanders. Eaker had always believed in the self-defending capability of the large daylight bomber formation. The prevailing tactical assumption in operations was “the security of the force”; the larger the bomber stream, the more secure it would be.® The Eighth Fighter Command under Brigadier General Frank Hunter shared Eaker’s view that unescorted bomber operations were possible, and for much of the summer and autumn, when Eighth Bomber Command losses were rising, he ordered fighter sweeps across northern France and the Low Countries that on some occasions encountered no German aircraft at all. When it was insisted that the  Page 171 of 562 30% American fighter aircraft but in the interim adding two wing tanks to the new P-51 Mustang fighter. He concluded, “This is a ‘must.”! The P-51 did not see long-range service over Germany until the planation for eventual victory in what Major General Frederick Anderson, Spaatz’s deputy from January 1944, called “the battle of Germany.”? with Portal in the late autumn of 1943, he got his way.2 The P-51 entered service in early December 1943 with drop tanks that could take it 475 miles into Germany; when it finally came onstream capability of the large daylight bomber formation. The prevailing tactical assumption in operations was “the security of the force”; the larger the bomber stream, the more secure it would be.2 The P-47s escort the bombers more effectively, the range was still too short to provide more than limited assistance, and made shorter still by the order to fly a weaving route next to the bomber formation to match its speed. In August 1943, after the first Schweinfurt raid, Arnold insisted on sacking Hunter and replacing him with Major General William Kepner, a dedicated fighter general, popular with his crews,
