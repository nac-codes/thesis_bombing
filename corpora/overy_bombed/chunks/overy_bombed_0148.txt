Spaatz took over Eaker’s headquarters, while Doolittle commanded the Eighth from “Widewing,” up until then headquarters for Anderson’s Bomber Command. Anderson became chief of operations to Spaatz. Arnold had been insensitive enough to notify Eaker of the change in command by telegraph back on December 19, rather than in person, consistent with his testy treatment of Eaker earlier in the summer. Eaker objected vehemently to the change, but his objections were overruled; on January 6, Doolittle took over the Eighth and Eaker left to command strategic forces in the Mediterranean at just the point when large numbers of bombers and escort fighters were at last coming through the pipeline to transform the capability of the air force Eaker was RAE REE BAAS SE Sie Site We BSAA Se, Selene Be A ae RARE Neer Seen SA EEE Sl ete ae SESE AAA Fe SSAA CE ee SE See ee FS ee BAS ee Sere.

Spaatz, Doolittle, and Kepner shared a common strategic outlook on the importance of combining the indirect assault on air force production and supplies through bombing with the calculated attrition of the German fighter force through air-to-air combat and fighter sweeps over German soil. Spaatz spent some weeks reviewing the offensive in January 1944 and then told Doolittle that destroying German
