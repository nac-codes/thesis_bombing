f the German fighter force through air-to-air combat and fighter sweeps over German soil. Spaatz spent some weeks reviewing the offensive in January 1944 and then told Doolittle that destroying German fighter strength and increasing the tempo of attacks on German aircraft production was “a critical deciding factor in Germany’s defeat.” Doolittle was from the start eager to use his large force, now with more than 1,000 bombers and 1,200 fighters, to destroy the German air arm. Commenting to Spaatz on the plans for completing the Combined Bomber Offensive, he was critical of the idea of pursuing “economic” bombing, and argued for making attacks on the enemy fighter force in the air and on the ground the “primary consideration,” as it had been when he was a commander in the Mediterranean.1*  Kepner had already begun to transform the tactics of fighter support before Doolittle’s appointment. The key was to allow the fighter escorts to engage the enemy fighter force and not simply protect the bombers; this had been the dilemma facing German fighters in the Battle of Britain, when they were eventually compelled to fly as close support for the bomber stream and lost their combat  Page 172 of 562 30% Wer?lt Ito Moairyitis the r-4/ SO that it COUIG TeaCh) fal ilo Gerinlany.

The prevailing tactical assumption in operations was “the security of the force”; the larger the bomber stream, the more secure it would be.® The flexibility. From January 1944 onward, American fighter units were ordered to “pursue the Hun until he was destroyed.” The new tactic of “Free Lance” allocated some fighter planes to abandon the bombers entirely and seek the German force wherever it was to be found. The escort aircraft, flying in loose groups of four, ranged up to seven or eight miles away from the bomber stre
