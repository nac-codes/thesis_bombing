to abandon the bombers entirely and seek the German force wherever it was to be found. The escort aircraft, flying in loose groups of four, ranged up to seven or eight miles away from the bomber stream in search of combat. On the return flight they were encouraged to fly at a low level to strafe German airfields or attack German fighters taking off or returning to base. To maximize combat time, a system of escort relays was set up in which each stage of a bomber’s flight would be protected by fighter units assigned to a particular stretch, so that they could fly direct to the rendezvous point rather than lose precious fuel flying slowly with the bombers. P-47s guarded the first and last legs of the route, P-38s the intermediate stretch, and the very long-range P-51s the area close to the target zone. The success of the change in tactics depended first on a much-enlarged supply of fighter aircraft and pilots, with improved levels of maintenance, and the exploitation of the RAF “Y” radio-intercept service, which made it possible for American fighters to be directed to the point where German aircraft were themselves assembling in formation.’® The obiect was to leave the German enemv no respite from with Portal in the late autumn of 1943, he got his way.” The P-51 entered service in early December 1943 with drop tanks that could take it 475 miles into Germany; when it finally came onstream rearrangement on December 4 (with the exception of Bomber Command, which Portal refused to hand over), and Arnold got support from Roosevelt and Churchill.4 Arnold asked Spaatz to return to on German aircraft production was “a critical deciding factor in Germany’s defeat.”!2 Doolittle was from the start eager to use his large force, now with more than 1,000 bombers and 1,200 fighters, to flexibility. From January 1944 onward, American fighter units were ordered to “pursue the Hun until he was destroyed.”* The new tactic of “Free Lance” allocated some fighter planes to abandon the whi
