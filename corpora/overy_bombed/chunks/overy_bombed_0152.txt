and the expansion of fighter output was Géring’s deputy, Erhard Milch, who understood more clearly than his master that “the homeland is more important than the front.”!® The allocation of priority to the defense of the Reich and to fighter produc- tion brought about not only a regular process of tactical and technical readjustment, but a major change in command and organization as well. In August 1943 the chief of staff, Hans Jeschonnek, who effectively carried the weight of high command in Géring’s increasing absence, found the constant criticism and abuse from his commander in chief over the bombing offensive impossible to with- stand. On August 19 he shot himself, leaving behind two letters for Hitler’s air adjutant condemning Goring’s incompetent leadership. Jeschonnek was not entirely blameless, since he had continually emphasized the importance of airpower at the fighting front rather than defense of the home territory.12 He was replaced by Colonel General Giinther Korten, whose relationship with Goring was better, but unlike Jeschonnek, he was committed to the idea of strengthening home air defenses and had Hitler’s support for doing so. In November, Kammhuber was removed from his post, one of the remaining obstacles to reorganizing the defensive system. In northern Germany, Fighter Corps I (Jagdkorps I), responsible for the fighter defense of most of western and central Germany, was expanded and placed under the command of Lieutenant General Josef “Beppo” Schmid, best known for supplying overoptimistic intelligence during the Battle of Britain. From a single fighter wing in January 1943, Schmid’s new command had eleven wings and twenty fighter groups by the end of the year. In December 1943, Hubert Weise, Luftwaffenbefehlshaber Mitte, was replaced by Colonel General Hans-Jiirgen Stumpff, the former commander of Air Fleet 5; on January 27 the command was renamed the Reich Air Fleet (Luftflotte Reich), now responsible for the coordinated control of the entire
