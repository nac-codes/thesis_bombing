lery and the German air-warning system to direct control by the Reich Air Fleet and the local fighter divisions. The system now more closely resembled the centralized control structure set up by Fighter Command in Britain in 1940. From Stumpff’s headquarters in Berlin it was possible, using the radar information from Fighter Corps I, to communicate a running account of the air battle to the fighter units to ensure a concentrated response; for his part, Schmid had no fewer than 148 direct telephone lines to fighter stations and control centers.”+ The German Air Force knew a remarkable amount about the British and American air forces. Most of the information came from downed Allied aircraft and interrogated prisoners. The bombers’ predictable tactics and long flying time over German territory in the last months of 1943 had contributed to the escalating loss rates imposed on each bombing mission.”? The electronic war, which had swung briefly in the Allies’ favor with the use of Window over Hamburg, was more evenly balanced by the end of the year. German researchers quickly discovered ways to neutralize the effects of Window with two devices, Wtirzlaus and Niirnberg, which allowed the more skillful radar operators to distinguish between Window echoes and an airplane; by the end of the year, 1,500 Wurzburg radar devices had been modified. The German Telefunken researchers came up with a new air radar device, code-named SN-2, that could operate impervious to Window interference, and a crash production program was begun. The new Allied H2S radar navigation could also be tracked by the end of 1943 using a new homing device, Naxos-Z, which enabled German night fighters to track the which made it possible for American fighters to be directed to the point where German aircraft were themselves assembling in formation.1® The object was to leave the German enemy no respite from stand. On August 19 he shot himself, leaving behind two letters for Hitler’s air adjutant condemning Go
