e themselves assembling in formation.1® The object was to leave the German enemy no respite from stand. On August 19 he shot himself, leaving behind two letters for Hitler’s air adjutant condemning Goring’s incompetent leadership. Jeschonnek was not entirely blameless, since he had continually Window with two devices, Wiirzlaus and Niirnberg, which allowed the more skillful radar operators to distinguish between Window echoes and an airplane; by the end of the year, 1,500 Wiirzburg RAF Pathfinder Force; it also proved possible to get a bearing on the Allied bombers that were not carrying H2S by using their Identification Friend-or-Foe mechanism. Both breakthroughs contributed to Bomber Command's escalating losses. The Eighth Air Force began to use Window (code-named Chaff in the United States) on December 20, 1943, at the same time as introducing a Wiirzburg jammer known as Carpet to reduce losses by radar-guided antiaircraft fire. Here again German radio engineers found a partial solution by introducing a modification known as Wismar, which allowed the radar to switch frequencies and avoid the effects of Carpet, though by this time the tactical battle between the two air forces had rendered electronic protection less important.22 The keys to German air defense were assumed to be production and manpower. To meet the threat of daylight bombing, the antiaircraft artillery was substantially increased in early 1944, with 1,508 heavy batteries (5,325 guns), 623 light batteries (9,359 guns), and 375 searchlight batteries (5,000 lights of 200- or 150-centimeter diameter). Output of antiaircraft guns reached a peak in 1944 of 8,402 heavy and 50,917 light guns, but the wastage rate of barrels doubled over 1943 because of the increased bomber activity.24 An additional 250,000 personnel had to be found in 1944, mainly  recruited fram Soviet nrisoners of war Italian volunteers from Mussolini’s Italian Sacial Renuhlic air farce wounded and vans German volunteers This renresented
