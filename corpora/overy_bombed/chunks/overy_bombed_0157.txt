,402 heavy and 50,917 light guns, but the wastage rate of barrels doubled over 1943 because of the increased bomber activity.*4 An additional 250,000 personnel had to be found in 1944, mainly recruited from Soviet prisoners of war, Italian volunteers from Mussolini’s Italian Social Republic, air force wounded, and young German volunteers. This represented a damaging dilution of the quality of antiaircraft personnel. By the spring of 1944 some 111,000 women also served in the German antiaircraft defense system. To navigate the regime’s confused stance on employing women, posters reminded the female volunteers, “The woman ina soldier’s post but still a woman!”?* The antiaircraft batteries by 1944 were organized increasingly in large groups of heavy guns—Grossbatterien made up of three regular batteries—to produce more concentrated fire, but this made heavy demands on a less skilled and less robust workforce. Yet over the course of the year antiaircraft artillery came to replace the fighters as the main means for destroying or damaging enemy aircraft; the major industrial targets were protected by defensive strongpoints of no fewer than three Grossbatterien.*® Throughout the campaigns of 1943 and 1944, antiaircraft damage to Allied aircraft was extensive. An American raid on Berlin on March 6, 1944, resulted in damage to 48 percent of the 672 bombers that reached the target. Only faltering supplies of ammunition prevented antiaircraft fire from being more effective.?” The accelerated production of fighter aircraft also faced problems in late 1943, partly because aircraft production was still controlled by the Air Ministry while the rest of the armaments economy had been centralized under Albert Speer’s Ministry of Armaments and War Production, and partly because of Géring’s renewed efforts to revive German offensive airpower by switching resources to bombers again in the winter of 1943. The current plans for producing more than 30,000 fighters in 1944 and 48,000 in 194
