urces to posed by Goring’s revival of bomber plans pushed Milch, for political as well as practical reasons, to offer control over aircraft production to Speer to achieve a long-overdue rationalization of the whole German aircraft program to revive and expand.*° It was nevertheless evident by the end of 1943 that sheer numbers of German fighter aircraft were not the entire solution. The production of aircraft had to be balanced against losses, and despite the success rate of German day and night fighters against the major raids of the autumn and winter, the cumulative attrition of the fighter force made it difficult to expand overall force strength despite the very substantial increases in output. Although 3,700 day and night fighters were produced between September and December 1943, the force at Stumpff’s disposal when he assumed command in December numbered just 774 day fighters and 381 night fighters, with serviceability levels of 60-70 percent because of shortages of spares and skilled ground personnel.*!

The Eighth Air Force began to use Window (code-named Chaff in the United States) on December 20, 1943, at the same time as introducing a Wiirzburg jammer reminded the female volunteers, “The woman in a soldier’s post but still a woman!””* The antiaircraft batteries by 1944 were organized increasingly in large groups of heavy guns—Grossbatterien made on March 1, 1944. As aresult, in 1944 three times as many fighters were produced than in 1943, in the hope that this would be sufficient to hold back the Allied bombers long enough to allow the whole Ger
