not least because of the problem of fuel supply. Yet the figures matched what the crisis in the skies over Germany seemed to require.”® Milch collaborated closely with Speer and the head of production structure.?° In February the two men reached an agreement to run together an emergency “Fighter Staff” (Jagerstab) with Saur as its director, and it was established with Hitler’s agreement on March 1, 1944. As aresult, in 1944 three times as many fighters were produced than in 1943, in the hope that this would be sufficient to hold back the Allied bombers long enough to allow the whole German Air Force was slow to adapt to the changed reality. Goring famously insisted that the first long-range American fighters to crash near Aachen must have drifted there with the prevailing wind.*4 The existing German fighter force was divided between the Me110/Me410 “destroyer” aircraft, armed with rockets and cannon against the Allied bombers, and the more versatile Me109 and Fw190 fighters that were responsible when necessary for air-to-air combat with enemy fighters. Once American escorts appeared, the slower twin-engine German “destroyers” were sitting ducks. The first reaction was to move defense units farther into Germany in the hope that Allied escort fighters would still have a limit to their range. But the heavier destroyers now had to be escorted by the single-engine fighters, which meant that they too would be tied to a role in which they would be at a persistent disadvantage. In March the destroyers were finally withdrawn altogether after one wing of forty-three aircraft lost twenty-six in one raid, but the prevailing German view was still that their single-engine fighters had to try to get close to the enemy bombers to inflict damage, leaving those fighters easier prey to the increasingly aggressive Americans.** The more flexible the tactics of the Eighth Fighter Command became, the more inflexible the tactical demands on the German Air Force.
