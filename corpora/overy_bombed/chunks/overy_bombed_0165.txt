Only faltering supplies of ammunition prevented antiaircraft fire from being more effective.22 posed by Géring’s revival of bomber plans pushed Milch, for political as well as practical reasons, to offer control over aircraft production to Speer to achieve a long-overdue rationalization of the whole production structure.?? In February the two men reached an agreement to run together an emergency “Fighter Staff” (Jagerstab) with Saur as its director, and it was established with Hitler’s agreement on March 1, 1944. Asa result, in 1944 three times as many fighters were produced than in 1943, in the hope that this would be sufficient to hold back the Allied bombers long enough to allow the whole wind.** The existing German fighter force was divided between the Me110/Me410 “destroyer” aircraft, armed with rockets and cannon against the Allied bombers, and the more versatile Me109 and These weaknesses were cruelly exposed when Spaatz unleashed his campaign for air superiority over Germany.
