llow the whole German aircraft program to revive and expand.?2 and December 1943 the German fighter force lost 967 aircraft in combat, principally with the American P-47 Thunderbolt, but a further 1,052 to accidents.” The second factor was pilot strength and priorities, which were finally resolved at a meeting between Eisenhower and the senior Allied commanders in Europe on March 25, 1944, in favor of the “Transportation Plan” for interrupting German rail traffic in northwest Europe. Spaatz was able to start his assault on the German Air Force before these arguments had been properly formulated and resolved—and in the event between January and May 1944 the Eighth and Ninth air forces based in Britain dropped 111,546 (75 percent) tons of bombs on strategic targets against 38,119 (25 percent) on tactical ones.” The real problem for Spaatz was the difficulty in persuading Harris to share in the task of defeating the German Air Force.  Harris was determined in early 1944 not to abandon the city attacks for a more concentrated assault on German Air Force targets. In January his command was asked directly to abandon indiscriminate area attacks (Harris scrawled “never has been” in the margin of the memorandum) in favor of raids on ball-bearing factories and fighter output as a contribution to the Eighth Air Force effort to establish “free deployment” for the day campaign over Germany.*® Figures were produced by Bomber Command intelligence to show that over one-third of German man-hours had been lost in production structure.?? In February the two men reached an agreement to run together an emergency “Fighter Staff” (Jagerstab) with Saur as its director, and it was established with Hitler’s agreement on March 1, 1944. Asaresult, in 1944 three times as many fighters were produced than in 1943, in the hope that this would be sufficient to hold back the Allied bombers long enough to allow the whole targets in support of Operation Overlord, which was expected in February 1944 to
