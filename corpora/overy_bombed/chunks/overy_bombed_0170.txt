A total of 95 aircraft were lost out of the 795 dispatched, the highest loss rate of the war, 11.9 percent.

In the end the defeat of the German Air Force was an American achievement. Spaatz divided the campaign into three elements: Operation Argument to undermine German aircraft production; a follow-up campaign against the German oil industry to starve the air force of its most precious resource; and finally, continuous counterforce attacks against German fighters and their organization.
