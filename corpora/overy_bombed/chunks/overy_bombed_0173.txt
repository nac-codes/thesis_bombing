an night-fighter force were also high, but by the spring they could see that they were gaining as close to a victory as air war would allow.*4 at the end of Big Week than it had been at the beginning.*® understated the reality. The MEW estimate of German fighter production for the first half of 1944 was 655 a month, whereas the reality was 1,581 and rising steadily.4® The aero-engine industry, more difficult to disperse and more vulnerable, was not attacked, a failure that Goring later pointed out to his postwar interrogators.*? The attacks accelerated the further dispersal of the industry and prompted a program for underground construction in which aircraft had a priority, a planned 48 million square meters of floor space out of a provisional total of 93 million.*® Output nevertheless continued to increase rapidly despite the bombing, and this has encouraged the view that Operation Argument effectively failed. The figures show, however, that the Allied attacks, which continued intermittently thereafter, did reduce planned fighter output substantially below expectations. Between January and June 1944, 9,255 German single-engine fighters were produced instead of the planned 12,667, a shortfall of 27 percent. The heaviest loss was experienced in February 1944 with a shortfall of 38.5 percent of planned output.*® Not all of this loss was due to bombing, since many other factors affected industrial performance by 1944, but the impact in February almost certainly was. The problem for Allied calculations was the failure to apprehend the rapid conversion in Ger- many to fighter priority and the successful rationalization and reorganization of aircraft production. Spaatz also planned to attack oil facilities, particularly those producing aviation fuel, which were more vulnerable than aircraft assembly halls because of the large capital plant involved and  Page 181 of 562 32% —— Eee ee eee eee Ul ee ee ae ee ee EE ee eeE ———————————e—E————eeee— eee Harris’s fear that his for
