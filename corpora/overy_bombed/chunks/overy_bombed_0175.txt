The aim to destroy or immobilize twenty-seven key oil targets was presented to Portal and Eisenhower as a surer way to undermine German military mobility at the front line, but the estimate that it might structure, whereas Harris just believed in “piling the maximum on the whole structure.”*? Portal nevertheless made little effort to get Harris to comply with the American plan to hit air force targets, Harris’s fear that his force could not hit a small urban target effectively was right.** expanding German night-fighter force were also high, but by the spring they could see that they were gaining as close to a victory as air war would allow.* understated the reality. The MEW estimate of German fighter production for the first half of 1944 was 655 a month, whereas the reality was 1,581 and rising steadily.*® The aero-engine industry, prompted a program for underground construction in which aircraft had a priority, a planned 48 million square meters of floor space out of a provisional total of 93 million.** Output nevertheless take three months to do so made oil plants, in Portal’s view, a long-term objective. Instead, the Transportation Plan won the day. In the end Spaatz succeeded in undertaking attacks on German oil targets by sleight of hand. In April 1944 the Fifteenth Air Force began a number of raids against the Romanian oil-producing city of MM, nominally against “marshaling yards.” In fact the raids hit the oilfield, as intended, and in early May, Eaker gave tacit approval for further attacks on Romanian oil production.
