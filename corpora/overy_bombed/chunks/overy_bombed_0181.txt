han the ones they had met in the spring.  For American aircrews the situation was less rosy than German accounts might suggest. Morale dropped for them too during the spring offensive, partly because of high losses, partly because of the demands made on the crews from bad-weather flying. In March and April 1944, eighty-nine bomber crews chose to fly to Swiss or Swedish bases for internment. Conditions were made worse by the decision to abandon automatic repatriation of crews to the United States after twenty-five missions in order to keep up the number of experienced aircrew available.*” German interrogation reports of crashed American aircrew found a deep fear of antiaircraft fire, and a strong dislike of the order to conduct low-level attacks against German airfields because of light flak and the tactic of stringing thick steel hawsers (Drahtsnerre) across narrow vallev annroaches to slice into an attacking fighter.*2 A maior hazard was the return flight with battle damage and the difficulty of landing awav from decision to abandon automatic repatriation of crews to the United States after twenty-five missions in order to keep up the number of experienced aircrew available.*”?

The crew of one B-24 Liberator bomber, hit by antiaircraft fire over Brussels, bailed out over Kent at the last moment before the damaged aircraft exploded: “I broke an ankle and incurred internal injuries,” recalled the pilot. “The navigator hit a tree and broke his back. . . .
