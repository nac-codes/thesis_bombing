This was a situation the German Air Force wanted to reverse. In September 1944 a staff paper reflected on the lessons of the Battle of Britain: “We must try to achieve what England achieved in 1940.”*4 The larger question posed by the “Battle of Germany” is why the German Air Force failed where in 1940 the RAF—by a nar- row margin—succeeded. There are certainly grounds for comparison. The German Air Force had a substantial fighter force with technology at the cutting edge, particularly after the Me109 fighter was refitted with the more powerful Daimler-Benz 605A engine; aircraft production was concentrated on an emergency fighter program; a large pool of more than 2,000 fighter pilots was regularly available; there was a complex advance-warning system based on sophisticated radar equipment; and the organizational reforms during the winter of 1943-44 created a central control and communications system not unlike the  Page 187 of 562 33% eee eee eee ee ee eS A le St Se SSB SEES IEE EE EE RES AER RAVES Oh OS See SF ee SANS Sa SS Se ee Saas SE Se She 2S Se SS SEA TE eee Se thick steel hawsers (Drahtsperre) across narrow valley approaches to slice into an attacking fighter.*® A major hazard was the return flight with battle damage and the difficulty of landing away from injuries,” recalled the pilot. “The navigator hit a tree and broke his back. . ..
