ember 1940. German Air Force monthly fighter losses were already 30 percent of the force in January 1944 and more than 50 percent by May (see table 3.1). Numerical inferiority was then compounded with the demand that German fighters seek out the Allied bombers rather than fighters, which made them more vulnerable at the moment of attack, and by the decision to assemble large numbers of fighters together (like Douglas Bader’s “Big Wings” in the Battle of Britain); this meant time lost in flight to assembly points and, for pilots who had flown on the Eastern Front in pairs or loose groups of four, a difficult adjustment to flying in larger formations.® The RAF in 1940 avoided both of these operational handicaps by using Spitfires against enemy fighters, Hurricanes against the bombers, while Dowding judiciously resisted the switch to “Big Wings.” The difference between the two sides was not simply a product of economic resources, as is usually argued, but stemmed from operational and tactical  a nS Ra Ee Se MORRO: DOT Se, NS SN  Page 188 of 562 33% aircratt losses On all fronts equaled 15/ percent or establisned strengtn, 6,257 1oSt In combat, 3,60U6 due to accidents, predominantly aue to poor weather or pilot error.
