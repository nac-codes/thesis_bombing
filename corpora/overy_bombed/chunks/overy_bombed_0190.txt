Yet Hitler did many things right in relation to the air war: he did not in the end obstruct the shift to fighter priority, favored a heavy anti aft defense, authorized the dispersal of industry underground, and bullied the air force into prioritizing improvements in electronic warfare. Goring aside, the other leadership problems stemmed from lower down the air force tree.
