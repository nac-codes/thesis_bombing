ive was formally reactivated in September 1944 after three months in which the priority for Allied air forces had been supporting the invasion of France and the defeat of German armies in the west. Eisenhower eventually relinquished control of the strategic air forces on September 14, 1944, though he retained the right to request help with the land war when needed. Both bomber commanders were eager to return to what they saw as their primary mission. Spaatz reported to Arnold on the revival of the preinvasion command structure with the comment that “the Hun has still got a lot of fight left in him ... we must concentrate to kill him off.” By July, Harris was impatient to restart full-scale bombing because he expected Germany to have recovered fully in five bomb-free months. In August, Portal warned Churchill that there were evident signs of German revival, which would have to be snuffed out by a bombing policy of “continuous attrition.”@  What followed from September 1944 to May 1945 was an Allied campaign with the heaviest weight of bombs and the highest level of German casualties of the war. Over the eight months until German surrender the Eighth and Fifteenth air forces together with Bomber Command dropped three-quarters of the wartime bomb total against a deteriorating German defense; approximately half of all German deaths from bombing occurred over the same period. It is the extravagant power of this final bombing campaign, and its massive damage to Germany’s civilian population, urban infrastructure, and cultural heritage, that has occasioned most postwar criticism of bombing strategy.
