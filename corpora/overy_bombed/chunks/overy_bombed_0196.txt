t employment of the Me262 jet fighter/fighter- bomber, confirmed the Allied view that Germany’s military situation might abruptly improve. The so-called vengeance weapons hit British targets indiscriminately, first the V-1 flying bomb, which was first launched in mid-June, and then the V-2 rocket, which first fell on London in September. The Me262 was a crude fighter, easily adapted to mass production, but with its high speed it appeared capable of posing a serious challenge to the bomber fleets had it been available in sufficient numbers. The few units equipped with the Me262 by the end of the war claimed to have shot down 300 heavy bombers. The new aircraft was certainly welcomed by German air leaders as a possible war winner. Evaluations of the war situation produced in September 1944 and January 1945 by German Air Force intelligence presented the possibility of a “final victory” given the apparent decline in Anglo-American military capability and enthusiasm since the summer and the clutch of dangerous new technical developments available to Germany; these included the Wasserfall ground-to-air missile (V-4), proximity fuses, jet fighters (Me262 and Heinkel He162), jet bombers (Arado Ar243), rocket  Balsa (MALO and ansinw net Fae nneeineenl Antantinn 2d Anntersntinn Af nn neces aienen ft 17 Onn AL tL nnn Anern ane nents crrnen cera] len nein ta tL AMinn Atlnen we nenles nna neelatinn Tha .ncennnnnd renewed bombing effort, despite the profound crisis now facing German airpower: “The war can only be brought to a satisfactory conclusion if we take the offensive.””1 has still got a lot of fight left in him ... we must concentrate to kill him off.””* By July, Harris was impatient to restart full-scale bombing because he expected Germany to have recovered fully in five in 1940 to almost two-thirds by 1944, a reflection of popular anxiety to end the war quickly and a growing familiarity with bombing as a central pillar of Allied strategy.” The BBC air commentaries people
