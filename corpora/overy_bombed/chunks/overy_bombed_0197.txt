But by October he warned that jet aircraft and enhanced weaponry, including the powerful 30-millimeter cannon, might well “overwhelm our defenses” in attacks on Germany.” Anglo-American air intelligence confirmed, as Harris had warned, that by the autumn the German single-engine fighter force would be larger than at any point in 1944.
