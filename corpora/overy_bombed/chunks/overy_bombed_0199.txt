This was indeed the case: by the beginning of 1944 the German armed forces had thousands of tons of chemical weapons on hand, including the deadly agents sarin and tabun.® In December the Joint Chiefs of Staff were supplied with full details of the toxic gases available to American forces for the conduct of gas warfare from the air in both the European and Pacific theaters, and in 1944 an accelerated program for the production of gas bombs was set in motion. In January, Arnold’s headquarters could confirm that the air force “can be effectively employed for waging gas warfare.”®4 British preparations for gas warfare were much further advanced and more likely to be used. In January 1944, Portal told Churchill that he was toying with the idea of using gas to attack preliminary V-weapon installations that had been identified in France and the Low Countries, but hesitated to do so because the repercussions of starting gas warfare “would be far-reaching.” The RAF was nevertheless alert for the first whiff of German gas in order to activate its extensive plans for airborne gas attacks.
