, Roosevelt authorized a War Research Board directed by George Merck, with an advisory board of prominent scientists, disguised simply as the “ABC Committee,” whose first task was to work out ways to protect the American population from a possible German or Japanese bacteriological attack. In late 1942 the work was taken over by the Chemical Warfare Service, which set up a research facility at Camp Detrick in Frederick, Maryland. As with gas warfare, intelligence began to appear in 1943 that suggested Germany was planning the use of biological warfare agents, and in particular “bacillus botulinus” (now known as Clostridium botulinum, the cause of botulism), which was impossible to detect in an airborne attack, caused symptoms in four to five hours, and death by embolism in most cases. The assumption was that Germany would only hesitate to use biological weapons because of the threat of “instant reprisal,” and as a result a program to produce lethal pathogens was accelerated. A further report in January 1944 warned that rocket or air attacks using bacteria might be imminent, and their effects “devastating.” This included the probability of using anthrax spores directed at human populations.*° Three plants were set up for experiment and production in Mississippi, Indiana, and Utah; sixty workers were inadvertently infected, but none died.*! Before biological agents became available in sufficient quantities, which would not be before April 1945, it was recommended that retaliation should be with  Page 195 of 562 34% the two allies. In late 1943 these anxieties revived. Intelligence from a captured Italian diplomat suggested that Germany had large stocks of gas but would only use them “in a last resort.” Churchill, concentrated raids using a mix of gas bombs, incendiaries, and high explosive, which would have to be repeated regularly “on the most densely populated centres.”® The air staff understood that even 11,000 sorties using gas and other bombs against a variety of
