and high explosive, which would have to be repeated regularly “on the most densely populated centres.”® The air staff understood that even 11,000 sorties using gas and other bombs against a variety of military and civilian targets.8® The stalemate in Normandy and the onset of the V-weapons campaign brought further pressure from Churchill to use gas to speed up German defeat: “I want a cold-blooded calculation made,” he wrote on July 6, “as to how it would pay us to use poison gas ... we could drench the cities of the Ruhr.”®” But leaders during 1944).8* Nevertheless, by early 1945 the American Chemical Warfare Service had sufficient stocks of gas in theater to maintain a campaign equivalent to 25 percent of the total available This included the probability of using anthrax spores directed at human populations. Three plants were set up for experiment and production in Mississippi, Indiana, and Utah; sixty workers were gas.22 Would the Allies have used either gas or germ warfare? The question was never tested, since Hitler was opposed to their use and more concerned about defense against a possible Allied biological attack.®3 But the development of both Allied programs shows the extent to which perception of the German enemy colored the decision to continue heavy bombing in case worse weapons were to hand. The most significant factor is that fear of chemical and biological weapons prompted the Allies to think in terms of retaliation against civilian populations on a large scale, turning interwar fantasies about gas and germs into potential reality. The RAF staff thought that incendiary and high-explosive raids were more strategically efficient, in that they destroyed property and equipment and not just people, but in any of these cases—blown apart, burnt alive, or asphyxiated—deliberate damage to civilian populations was now taken for granted. This paved the way for the possibility of using atomic weapons on German targets in 1945 if the war had dragged on late into t
