Alongside oil and transport, the directive allowed attacks on “important industrial areas” when visual bombing was impaired, as well as policing attacks on the German Air Force organization and, when required, direct support of land operations.1“ Bombing preferences in fact remained divided: Spaatz, Doolittle, and Bufton preferred the oil campaign; Tedder and Zuckerman sponsored communications; Harris, who had a strong personal antipathy to Zuckerman (“the ‘expert’ Mr. Solly Zuckerman”) and to Bufton (“one of my ex-Station commanders”), remained wedded to the idea that oil and transport were expensive, dangerous, and futile objectives when the destruction of cities could be more ee etler = an mae act ote 2d O02 Ton Laan mone marele mene aL lathaws atte Nauta Mate arcnce Jan fbed Lies Neekbe\ toe Ma enebnan 1QAA WWaccle wninnted the ofl lee man thee cence De bh nk 86 creme d ened = mee mwtne of a nt ne  Page 198 of 562 35% ——_ oe ee ee ot ea ae i a a | people, but in any of these cases—blown apart, burnt alive, or asphyxiated—deliberate damage to civilian populations was now taken for granted.
