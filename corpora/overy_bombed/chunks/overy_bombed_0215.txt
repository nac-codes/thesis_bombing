The Rhine was blocked at Cologne by a lucky strike on the Cologne-Miilheim Bridge, which collapsed into the water, blocking one of Germany’s main traffic waterways. By November the German Railway was down to eleven days’ supply of coal, by December 12 down to five days. Southern and eastern parts of Germany were starved of coal; locomotives and wagons were routinely strafed by fighters and fighter-bombers. Out of 250,000 goods wagons available, almost half were inoperable by late November. Total rail freight traffic fell by 46 percent from September 1944 to January 1945.In the Ruhr, rolling stock available for daily use was by late October half the level of September. Rolling stock was withdrawn farther away from the attacks in western Germany, but the result was to block supplies of coal and coke from the Ruhr and force a reduction of one-third in electricity generation.1°” Serious damage to the Mittelland Canal, the main link between the Ruhr and central Germany, left it unusable for much of October and November. Coal traffic on inland waterways was 2.2 million tons in September, but 422,000 in December.1® Hitler ordered the transfer of 1,000 heavy and 2,000 light antiaircraft guns to defend key transport junctions, but as a result denuded the defense available to other vital war industries. Ultra intelligence decrypts kept the Allies regularly aware of the im- pact the transport plan was having and encouraged its expansion.1° Somehow or other, amid the accumulating chaos of smashed rail lines, burnt-out cities, and crumpled factories, the German Air Force continued to sustain a threat to the ubiquitous enemy.
