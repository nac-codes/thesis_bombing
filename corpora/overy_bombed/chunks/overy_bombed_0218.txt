Coal traffic on inland waterways was 2.2 million tons in September, but 422,000 in December.“ Hitler ordered the transfer of 1,000 heavy and 2,000 pact the transport plan was having and encouraged its expansion.1% high (the peak in September 1944 was only 1.9 percent of sorties); losses amounted to just 1.37 percent of all sorties in the last eight months of the war.112 Meanwhile, the German Air Force remained fighter squadron armed with the new model began operations only in November.14 by 1945 the figure was sixty.412 The more experience crews got, the better their chances of survival. The German night-fighter force, on the other hand, was hit by the collapse in fuel supply in a The dynamos needed to charge the radar equipment could not be operated because of fuel shortages; electricity supply to the radar stations was intermittent by the winter months of 1944, which also reduced training time on the new detection instruments."? Most night fighters were now the high-quality Junkers Ju88G, fitted with SN2 and Naxos equipment, and the Flensburg detector used to home in to an Allied bomber’s “Monica” signals. By chance this equipment fell undamaged into British hands when a disoriented German night-fighter pilot landed in error on a Bomber Command station at Woodbridge in Suffolk in July 1944. Extensive testing soon showed that the simple expedient of turning off both the Monica tail radar and the H2S set would blind the enemy night fighters. New devices—“Perfectos,” “Piperack,” and “Serrate IV’—were developed to give warning of enemy fighters and to confuse German radar.14 Although a new round of research began in Germany, there was too little time or opportunity to profit from it as the infrastructure collapsed. The seesaw electronic war ended in the Allies’ fa
