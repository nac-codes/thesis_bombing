just 1.37 percent of all sorties in the last eight months of the war.1/2 Meanwhile, the German Air Force remained also reduced training time on the new detection instruments.? Most night fighters were now the high-quality Junkers Ju88G, fitted with SN2 and Naxos equipment, and the Flensburg detector used New devices—“Perfectos,” “Piperack,” and “Serrate IV’—were developed to give warning of enemy fighters and to confuse German radar“ Although a new round of research began in Germany, there influences within the Luftwaffe” but resolved nothing.* The anxieties in the West about the revival of German airpower now scarcely reflected the reality. The air force relied increasingly on gestures. New Sturmjdger (storm fighter) units were created from skilled pilots who flew their aircraft, armed with heavy new 30-millimeter cannon, straight at the bomber stream, regardless of the powerful fighter escort. The suicidal tactics were occasionally accompanied by ramming, despite Hitler’s disapproval of the idea of German kamikaze. To cope with the impossibility of day-to-day combat in small formations—usually groups of ten or twenty aircraft, now directed mainly at fighter-bombers and fighter-intruders rather than the bomber stream—Adolf Galland, the general of fighters, organized a plan for a “Great Blow” by building up a reserve of fighters and fuel to release a sudden devastating attack on a large bomber stream. By November 12 there were 3,700 fighters of all kinds available, around 2,500 assigned for the blow. The object was to shoot down at least 400 bombers in one raid to try to deter the Allied offensive and buy time for the buildup of modern air equipment, “the shock the enemy needed,” one of the pilots later told his American captors, “to make them cease their inroads into the heart of Germany.”45 At just the point that Galland and his commanders were waiting for the weather to clear, the units were ordered westward to the Ardennes to take part in Operation Autumn Mist (
