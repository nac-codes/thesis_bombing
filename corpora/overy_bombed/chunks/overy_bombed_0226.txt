te for the phantom last stand of German armies in the south. Although the city was ranked number 22 on the MEW list of target cities, with a key-point rating of 70, Harris had not yet attacked it in force, partly because of the long distance, but almost certainly because it contained no major industries linked to the current directive.424 By the autumn of 1944, Dresden was also routinely included on target lists issued to the Fifteenth Air Force stationed in Italy, along with other targets in southern and eastern Germany, but had not yet been attacked.122 When the Combined Strategic Targets Committee met in late November 1944, it listed cities for possible area attack when blind bombing was necessary, with an “x” to indicate oil targets present and “+” to indicate a key communications center. All thirteen cities in western Germany had one or both targets indicated; of the eleven selected in eastern Germany, seven were marked “+” but four—Dresden, Leipzig, Dessau, and Danzig—had no key target marked.122 The origin of the decision to bomb Dresden has been obfuscated by the long postwar debate over who should accept responsibility or blame for what happened. The historical narrative seems, however, clear enough. The possibility of an area attack on Dresden first surfaced in October 1944 when Portal responded to a request from Churchill for a list of “area targets” that the advancing Soviet air force might be able to bomb, which included Dresden among the seven suggested.1*4 Discussion about bombing cities in eastern Germany was always related to the progress of Soviet forces and the possibility of helping their advance by a display of Allied airpower. In mid-January 1945, Tedder met with Stalin to discuss the progress of the campaign against oil targets. Stalin showed great interest in the effects of bombing on German military fuel supplies and then showed Tedder the Soviet plans for the main Oder operation, launched five days later, on January 20.12° This discussion s
