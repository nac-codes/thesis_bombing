Combined Strategic Targets Committee met in late November 1944, it listed air force might be able to bomb, which included Dresden among the seven suggested.14 Discussion about bombing cities in eastern Germany was always related to the progress of Soviet forces and the targets. Portal and the air staff assessed the evidence but were unconvinced, and on January 26 their preference was still for attacks on oil and jet-fighter targets.12° However, the same day, Churchill, who must have read the report, asked Sinclair whether there were any plans to help the Soviet offensive. Dissatisfied with Sinclair’s equivocal response, he dashed off a note on January 26 demanding to know whether Berlin “and no doubt other large cities in East Germany” were now to be considered valuable targets. Sinclair replied on January 27 that Berlin, Dresden, Leipzig, and Chemnitz were all now on the list for possible attack when the weather had improved.122 The next day Portal wrote to Churchill that oil targets remained a key priority of the bombing war, but added the following: “We also intend, as you know, to apply as much bomber effort as we can to the cities of Eastern Germany, including Berlin: but oil must come first.”!2® Two days later Portal and Churchill both traveled to Malta for discussions with the Americans before going on to the conference at Yalta. The second response was to set in motion actual operations. On January 27, Bottomley sent Harris the JIC report and asked him to prepare attacks on Berlin, as well as the three principal Saxon cities: Dresden, Leipzig, and Chemnitz.122 He then drafted a paper for the chiefs of staff meeting, due to convene in Malta on January 31, which effectively summarized the grounds for the bombing: almost certainly because it contained no major industries linked to the current directive.12!
