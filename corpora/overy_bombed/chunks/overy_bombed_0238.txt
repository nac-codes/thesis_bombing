lind-bombing attacks came under public scrutiny. ill’s attitude to him did not alter “in any perceivable way” between 1942 and 1945. But the rift was important enough to be suppressed until its publication in the official history in 1961.18 furious days of ground combat, “is already over—and Germany has lost it.”132 On March 16-17, 1,127 tons of bombs were dropped on the small medieval city of Wiirzburg, killing between 4,000 and 5,000 people and destroying 89 percent of the city, a wartime record. Hildesheim was half destroyed on March 22 (the town center “should make a good fire,” the crews were told).1“° The small city of Paderborn was destroyed on March 27, and half of Plauen on April 10-11. The final catalog of area attacks could not be restrained even by Churchill. On April 4, Portal, spurred perhaps by Churchill’s minute, had notified the chiefs of staff that area attacks on industrial districts for the sake of destruction would now cease. When Harris destroyed Potsdam in a devastating raid on April 14-15, Churchill wrote angrily to Sinclair, “What was the point of going and blowing down Potsdam?” Portal replied a day later assuring the prime minister that Harris had already been told to discontinue industrial area attacks.14! The directive sent to Harris on April 16 for the first time since February 1942 no longer contained industrial areas or morale as dedicated objectives.142 The American air forces wound down operations in April 1945. Much of the bombing since the February attacks was tactical in nature, directed at almost any target that could be deemed an element of German resistance. Operation Clarion was carried out with mixed success against a range of smaller communications targets. On April 5 all objectives were defined henceforth as tactical, but American bombing of the shrinking German area reached a crescendo, with 46,628 tons dropped in nineteen days of raiding, almost the same weight dropped during the German Blitz, but in just three weeks.
