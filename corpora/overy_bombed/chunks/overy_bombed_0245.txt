Erhard Milch, Géring’s deputy at the Air Ministry, ranked “synthetic oil plants and railway communica- tions” together.4*4 On area bombing the German judgment was largely negative. It did not “cause the collapse of the German people” and was regarded, according to McDonald, as “the least important of the major target complexes.” When Goring was asked in one of his first interrogations on May 10 whether precision or area bombing was more effective in Germany’s defeat, he replied, “The precision bombing, because it was decisive.
