he unit was to be run by an air force officer, Air Commodore Claude Pelly, and the SHAEF target adviser, Solly Zuckerman, assisted by staff from the RE8 division of the Ministry of Home Security, which was to be closed down when the war ended.15° Both men were committed enthusiasts of the attack on communications, and their work and the subsequent reports reflected their bias. Galland, who ranked the offensive against transport, then oil, then the air force as the most decisive.*? In mid-June a full report of interrogation extracts was produced by the director of American air bombing, because it was decisive. Destroyed cities could be evacuated but destroyed industry was difficult to replace.”!5* In a USSBS interview on May 24 with Karl Koller, the last German Air Force chief of staff, Koller claimed, not altogether plausibly, that without precision attacks “Germany would have won the war.” He confirmed that oil and transport facilities were fatal targets for Germany.5* those interrogated. The survey board had an interest in arguing that in the Western theater airpower was decisive, thanks chiefly to the air victory achieved over Germany in the spring and summer of 1944, “which made devastating attack on [the German] economy possible.” The report highlighted the relative failure of area attacks, which “had little effect on production,” while singling out oil and communications as critical. The attack on Ruhr steel in late 1944 was also added as a key factor, but the choice of this period rather than Harris’s “Battle of the Ruhr” in 1943 added weight to the implication that it was American bombing that had been decisive. The treatment of city attacks (4 pages out of 109) minimized their impact on economic output. Statistics were presented showing that city attacks, overwhelmingly by the RAF, cost only around 2.7 percent of German economic potential in the target areas. It was calculated that the combined offensive cost 2.5 percent of potential German output in 1942.
