G6ring, whose transcripts reveal an almost boyish desire to share his knowledge of the German Air Force with the victors. The provisional conclusions among the cohort of German airmen, engineers, airfields, and combat attrition.1=4 Géring thought the collapse of oil supply to be the single most critical factor—“without fuel, nobody can conduct a war”—while Albert Speer, Hitler’s minister for armaments and war production, ranked communications at the top of the list of critical targets. Erhard Milch, Goring’s deputy at the Air Ministry, ranked “synthetic oil plants and railway communica- tions” together.4=4 On area bombing the German judgment was largely negative. It did not “cause the collapse of the German people” and was regarded, according to McDonald, as “the least important of bombing, because it was decisive. Destroyed cities could be evacuated but destroyed industry was difficult to replace.”1* In a USSBS interview on May 24 with Karl Koller, the last German Air Force chief of staff, Koller claimed, not altogether plausibly, that without precision attacks “Germany would have won the war.” He confirmed that oil and transport facilities were fatal targets for Germany.45* against oil and communications targets. A good deal of the report was devoted to demonstrating that the final industrial and military crisis in Germany was a result of the disintegration of rail and water traffic: “Enough has been said to show that the collapse of the German transport system ... was the fundamental and main reason for the contemporaneous collapse of German war industry.”152 This fitted with Zuckerman’s own prejudices. Even the assessment of oil supply, which the report regarded as critically disabling, concluded that the offensive against transport was responsible for preventing the recovery of Germany’s oil position.1** The judgment of the report on area bombing of German cities was even more damning than that of the USSBS.
