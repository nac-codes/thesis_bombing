he recovery of Germany’s oil position.1** The judgment of the report on area bombing of German cities was even more damning than that of the USSBS. Using methods pioneered earlier by the RE8 department, Zuckerman’s team calculated on the basis of twenty-one heavily bombed industrial cities that area bombing reduced potential war production by 0.5 percent in 1942, 3.2 percent in the first six months of 1943, 6.9 percent in the second six months of 1943, and then approximately 1 percent throughout 1944, when bombing again brought diminishing returns and area bombing was s only one of the factors affecting output. The figures were e lower than the USSBS estimates (which had been speculative extrapolations) because they were based on careful research across a range —— ee a eee ere ee eee eee Security, which was to be closed down when the war ended.4*° Both men were committed enthusiasts of the attack o on n communications, and their work and the subsequent reports reflected their bias. Their terms of reference were to examine the effects of bombing on German fighting capacity, the effectiveness of German defenses, and the accuracy of assessments of damage.1*4 Already hostage to —_—o ee airfields, and combat attrition.4*4 Géring thought the collapse of oil supply to be the single most critical factor—“without fuel, nobody can conduct a war”—while Albert Speer, Hitler’s minister for tions” together.4=4 On area bombing the German judgment was largely negative. It did not “cause the collapse of the German people” and was regarded, according to McDonald, as “the least important of bombing, because it was decisive. Destroyed cities could be evacuated but destroyed industry was difficult to replace. ”155 In a USSBS interview on May 24 with Karl Koller, the last German Air Force chief against oil and communications targets. A good deal of the report was devoted to demonstrating that the final industrial and military crisis in Germany was a result of the disintegration of rail a
