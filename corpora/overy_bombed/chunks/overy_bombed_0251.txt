ief against oil and communications targets. A good deal of the report was devoted to demonstrating that the final industrial and military crisis in Germany was a result of the disintegration of rail and water traffic: “Enough has been said to show that the collapse of the German transport system ... was the fundamental and main reason for the contemporaneous collapse of German war industry.”158 This fitted with Zuckerman’s own prejudices. Even the assessment of oil supply, which the report regarded as critically disabling, concluded that the offensive against transport was responsible for preventing the recovery of Germany’s oil position.1*2 The judgment of the report on area bombing of German cities was even more damning than that of the USSBS. Using methods pioneered earlier by the RE8 department, Zuckerman’s team calculated on the basis of twenty-one heavily bombed industrial cities that area bombing reduced potential war production by 0.5 percent in 1942, 3.2 percent in the first six months of 1943, 6.9 percent in the second six months of 1943, and then approximately 1 percent throughout 1944, when bombing again brought diminishing returns and area bombing was only one of the factors affecting output. The figures were lower than the USSBS estimates (which had been speculative extrapolations) because they were based on careful research across a range of cities and because they measured potential loss against a rising trend of output. In all twenty-one cities studied, war production expanded faster than it had done in a control cohort of fourteen cit- ies not subject to attack.1© Damning though this indictment was, and partial though Zuckerman’s position appeared to be, it fitted not only with the interrogation evidence but with the views among Air Ministry officials and RAF commanders in the two years after the war when hard thinking had to be done about what had been achieved by Bomber Command, rather than the combined offensive as a whole.
