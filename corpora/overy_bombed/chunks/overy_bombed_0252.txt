and RAF commanders in the two years after the war when hard thinking had to be done about what had been achieved by Bomber Command, rather than the combined offensive as a whole. Sydney Bufton, once an advocate of incendiary attacks on cities, produced a long critical assessment of area bombing in January 1945, in which he admitted the failure at Hamburg in 1943 as an example of misplaced confidence in the economic or morale effects of heavy urban destruction.1®1 Norman Bottomley, Portal’s deputy for the last three years of the war, and Harris’s successor as commander in chief at Bomber Command, contributed an assessment of British bombing at a workshop organized by Tedder, now chief of staff, in August 1947 under the code name Exercise Thunderbolt. The effect of area attack, he concluded, was “great but never critical,” nor was enemy morale ever “critically undermined,” a fact he blamed on poor intelligence. “Offensive against oil and transportation proved most effective,” he wrote, but only after the achievement of the vital precondition of air superiority.1® A lecture given in 1946 by one of the RAF officers on the British survey highlighted air force attrition, oil, and transport again, but argued that “Tittle worthwhile” had been achieved by area attacks before 1943, and thereafter the resistance of the German population and the reserve capacity of German ——— Oe ee eee airfields, and combat attrition.1=3 Géring thought the collapse of oil supply to be the single mi most critical factor—“without fuel, nobody can conduct a war”—while Albert Speer, Hitler’s minister for the major target complexes.” When Goring was asked in one of his first interrogations on May 10 whether precision or area bombing was more effective in Germany’s defeat, he replied, “The precision bombing, because it was decisive.
