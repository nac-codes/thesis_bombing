The proximate causes—defeating the German Air Force and emasculating oil supply and transport—are unlikely to be undermined by further research. The statistics nevertheless require some explanation about why the overall impact of bombing for much of the war period should have been so much lower than expectations. At its simplest level, as Henry Tizard put it after the war, “You can’t destroy an economy.” American economists drafted in to advise the U.S. war effort in Europe were critical of the idea that bombing either areas or specific industries would of itself produce cumulative damage. The Hungarian émigré economist Nicholas Kaldor, a member of the USSBS team, argued that the critical factors in choosing economic targets were the degree of “cushion,” the degree of “depth,” and the degree of “vulnerability.” The first was governed by the existing elasticity of the economy in terms of finding additional or substitute resources for those lost to bombing; the second measured the extent to which a particular product or resource was close to actual military use,
