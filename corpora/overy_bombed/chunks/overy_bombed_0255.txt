ffort in Europe were critical of the idea that bombing either areas or the air.4® Kaldor and his economist colleagues argued that for most of the war period Germany had a large cushion of resources of capital stock, labor, and raw materials that could be allocated to sustaining war production. His conclusion was based partly on the assumption, now generally regarded by historians as invalid, that Hitler did not order full-scale mobilization until 1944. The degree of allocation of productive resources to war purposes was in fact high from the start of the war, but many of the economies of scale characteristic of large-scale industrial production became effective only by 1942-43, while the unanticipated length of the campaign against the Soviet Union distorted war production plans at a critical juncture in 1941-42.19° Yet Kaldor was not wrong to argue that a cushion existed. The index of armaments output showed that German production increased threefold between 1941 and 1944, despite all the bombing; some individual categories of weapon expanded more than this, fighter aircraft by a factor of thirteen, tanks by a factor of five, heavy guns by a factor of four.4® As a result of the conquest of much of continental Europe, Germany had access to large resources beyond her borders. Although this also involved economic costs to Germany, occupation meant that over 119 billion marks were contributed to Germany’s war budget, one-quarter of all the costs of the armed forces; 7.9 million forced workers and prisoners of war were compelled to work in Germany, while an estimated 20 million more worked on orders for the German war effort in the occupied zones.1®2 Moreover, German technical and organizational ingenuity made it possible to find substitute products or productive capacity even for “bottleneck” industries like ball bearings, where, as Kaldor argued, the target had “run away” by the time the Allies attacked it again in 1944.45° The German economy, wrote the USSBS economis
