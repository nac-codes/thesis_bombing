orted war production plans at a critical juncture in 1941-4216 some individual categories of weapon expanded more than this, fighter aircraft by a factor of thirteen, tanks by a factor of five, heavy guns by a factor of four.4*” As a result of the conquest of much of worked on orders for the German war effort in the occupied zones.1®* Moreover, German technical and organizational ingenuity made it possible to find substitute products or productive capacity even for “bottleneck” industries like ball bearings, where, as Kaldor argued, the target had “run away” by the time the Allies attacked it again in 1944.1®° The German economy, wrote the USSBS economist John Kenneth Galbraith in an early evaluation, was “expanding and resilient, not static and brittle.”7° For most of the Allied bombing offensive these factors were either insufficiently known or not understood, and bombing, as a result, was relatively ineffective. Only in 1944, with the American decision to focus on enemy airpower, oil, and transport, were three targets chosen that fortuitously matched Kaldor’s calculation. The attack on the German aircraft assembly industry, as part of the assault against enemy airpower, was the least successful because of the substantial cushion that existed in dispersing the final stages of production; all German leaders claimed, however, that repeated attacks on aero-engine production would have been critical. Oil and transport facilities, on the other hand, had poor cushioning possibilities once heavy attacks began, were highly vulnerable to sustained attack, and had a positive “depth” factor because both were needed almost immediately by the armed forces and by industry to sustain fighting capability and output. The campaign against the German Air Force was indeed a precondition for the success of the campaigns against oil and transport, and was a direct result of the changing tactics of day bombing and the high priority given by Spaatz to suppressing German airpower as fully
