for the success of the campaigns against oil and transport, and was a direct result of the changing tactics of day bombing and the high priority given by Spaatz to suppressing German airpower as fully as possible. When German oil installations and air force operations both threatened a limited revival in late 1944, Spaatz shifted once again to priority oil and counterforce attacks. It is difficult not to argue that the U.S. air forces had a surer strategic grasp and a clearer set of strategic objectives than did Bomber Command. Counterforce operations and the search for target svstems that would 1nhinge the enemv’s military efforts were central elements in American wartime air dactrine. The RAF hv contrast. thought of airnower more as a form industry made them “resilient to area attack.”1® Given the uniformity of opinion on both the German and Allied side, the one based on experience, the other on extensive research, it is surprising that the air. Kaldor and his economist colleagues argued that for most of the war period Germany had a large cushion of resources of capital stock, labor, and raw materials that could be allocated to some individual categories of weapon expanded more than this, fighter aircraft by a factor of thirteen, tanks by a factor of five, heavy guns by a factor of four.1*” As a result of the conquest of much of for “bottleneck” industries like ball bearings, where, as Kaldor argued, the target had “run away” by the time the Allies attacked it again in 1944.1°° The German economy, wrote the USSBS economist John Kenneth Galbraith in an early evaluation, was “expanding and resilient, not static and brittle.”1”° and the search for target systems that would unhinge the enemy’s military efforts were central elements in American wartime air doctrine. The RAF, by contrast, thought of airpower more as a form of blockade, and was never enthusiastic about counterforce operations or attacks on transport, though both had been adopted in the Mediterranean camp
