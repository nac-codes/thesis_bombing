F, by contrast, thought of airpower more as a form of blockade, and was never enthusiastic about counterforce operations or attacks on transport, though both had been adopted in the Mediterranean campaign. The defeat of the German Air Force over Germany and the massive dislocation of German transport were primarily American achievements. Area bombing was nevertheless, despite its critics, not entirely without impact on the German war effort. The random and scattered nature of much of the city-bombing campaign had evident opportunity costs for the German war effort, in addition to the effects of substantial civilian casualties and damage to housing. Consumer goods production had to be increased in 1943, against the trend of total war mobilization, to meet the needs of bombed-out families. The night bombing interrupted utility services and hit shops and occasionally factories, necessitating the allocation of additional resources of manpower to cope. There is no way in which these kinds of costs can be computed, any more than there was in Britain as a result of the Blitz. The real question concerns assessment of the damage done to the German industrial working class, since this was the whole rationale behind the campaign. It has never proved possible to calculate the number of workers killed, rather than nonworkers (elderly, women with families, children, etc.), but some sense of the limitations of any such assessment can be found in the death statistics in Hamburg, where on the night of the firestorm in 1943 that killed over 18,000 people, only 280 were killed in the factory district, away from the main area of bombing.1â„¢4 Workers were not always the most likely victims, but even if the estimated total of 350,000 German dead from bombing were all workers, that would still have represented only 1.6 percent of the German industrial and rural workforce, some of whom would have been killed by American daytime bombs rather than by the RAF.
