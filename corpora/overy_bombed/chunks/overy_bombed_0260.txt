Given the uniformity of opinion on both the German and Allied side, the one based on experience, the other on extensive research, it is surprising that the air.4& Kaldor and his economist colleagues argued that for most of the war period Germany had a large cushion of resources of capital stock, labor, and raw materials that could be allocated to only by 1942-43, while the unanticipated length of the campaign against the Soviet Union distorted war production plans at a critical juncture in 1941-421 worked on orders for the German war effort in the occupied zones.*®* Moreover, German technical and organizational ingenuity made it possible to find substitute products or productive capacity even for “bottleneck” industries like ball bearings, where, as Kaldor argued, the target had “run away” by the time the Allies attacked it again in 1944.1 The German economy, wrote the USSBS economist John Kenneth Galbraith in an early evaluation, was “expanding and resilient, not static and brittle.”17° the firestorm in 1943 that killed over 18,000 people, only 280 were killed in the factory district, away from the main area of bombing.1”" Workers were not always the most likely victims, but even if the The other argument for area bombing was the high level of absenteeism it would induce, though the British evidence, on which the strategy was based, was scarcely convincing. German records show that absenteeism as a direct result of bombing made up 4.5 percent of hours lost at the height of the bombing in 1944; an additional 10.8 percent of hours were lost due to illness or leave, though these may well have been a response to circumstances caused by bombing. Figures of hours lost due to bombing were higher in targeted industries (7.9 percent in ship
