Few of those involved would have been potential soldiers, but many would have been potential war workers, if to optimize the use of resources and to conduct the military war effort as was the United States. The military consequences of the bombing campaign were clearly more important than the economic, This still begs the question of what it meant for the Allies. Galbraith, one of the USSBS team, later wrote in his memoirs that the man-hours, aircraft, and bombs “had cost the American economy far more in output than they had cost Germany.”2”8 Both air forces were sensitive to this charge and calculated themselves what proportion of the national effort could be attributed to the bombing. In the British case the proportion was calculated to be 7 percent of all man-hour equivalents, in the American case an estimated 12 percent of wartime expenditure, both figures that did not distort exceptionally the structure of either war effort, unless account is taken of just how wasteful much of the bombing was.1”2 Moreover, these were positive choices made about the allocation of resources, where in the German case the choice was involuntary, an addition to the other choices made about the distribution of strategic resources. Nevertheless the cost in manpower and aircraft lost in combat was substantial. In RAF Bomber Command, 47,268 were killed in action (or died as prisoners of war) and 8,195 in acci
