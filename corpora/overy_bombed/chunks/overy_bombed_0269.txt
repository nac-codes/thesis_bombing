strategic resources. Nevertheless the cost in manpower and aircraft lost in combat was substantial. In RAF Bomber Command, 47,268 were killed in action (or died as prisoners of war) and 8,195 in accidents. According to Harris, an estimated 135,000 flew in combat with Bomber Command, a loss rate of 41 percent. Total RAF dead during the war from all causes totaled 101,223, so that Bomber Command deaths amounted to 54.7 percent of all RAF losses.1®° Of these, the largest non-British contingent was composed of Canadians, 9,919 of whom died in Bomber Command.?®!

The costs were modest compared with the 9 million Soviet military dead and 5 million German dead, reflecting the priority of both Western Allies to avoid repeating the losses of the Great War for publics likely to be less tolerant of the escalating human cost to themselves than were populations under dictatorship. For Britain and the United States, the political advantages of preferring bombing to other forms of combat were to be found in the desire to limit the cost to the home population while maximizing the use of advanced technology and large manufacturing capacity to impose insupportable costs on the population, economy, and military structure of the enemy. Bombing could be used to maintain domestic morale and to exert leverage on the enemy in ways that were rendered easily visible in the democratic media.
