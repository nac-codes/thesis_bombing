Few of those involved would have been potential soldiers, but many would have been potential war workers, if ‘ar more in output than they had cost Germany.”!” Both air forces were sensitive to this charge and calculated themselves what proportion of the national effort could be attributed to the bombing. n the British case the proportion was calculated to be 7 percent of all man-hour equivalents, in the American case an estimated 12 percent of wartime expenditure, both figures that did not distort Command, a loss rate of 41 percent. Total RAF dead during the war from all causes totaled 101,223, so that Bomber Command deaths amounted to 54.7 percent of all RAF losses.1£° Of these, the largest non-British contingent was composed of Canadians, 9,919 of whom died in Bomber Command.1®!
