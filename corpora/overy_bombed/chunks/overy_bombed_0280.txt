Firemen were now to be knownas fire defense police (Feuerschutzpolizei), the volunteers as police auxiliaries.1° By 1940 standard and interchangeable equipment was available, including a single model light-alloy hose coupling that could be used for all types of hoses, and three standard pump appliances.4 In the end, the contest for jurisdictional The German public was largely free of these jurisdictional conflicts. Unlike most other European states, the principal aspects of air-raid protection were to be undertaken by the German population on its own behalf. The Luftschutzbund very quickly established itself as the national agent for educating, training, and supervising the community in every aspect of air-raid protection. By 1937 there were 2,300 local branches with over 400,000 officials and 11 million members. By 1942-43 there were 1.5 million officeholders and 22 million members. They paid just one mark a year in subscription. In return, members attended one of 3,400 air-raid schools, or local courses in first aid, self-protection, and firefighting.* For potential leaders there were Air Protection Academies to attend. In May 1937 the public’s civil defense role was defined in a law on “Self-Protection.” Three distinct forms of self-help were identified: “self-protection” (Selbstschutz), “extended self-protection” (Erweiterter Selbstschutz), and “work protection” (Werkluftschutz). Individual householders were expected to create their own “air-protection community” in each house or apartment block, responsible for creating an air defense room (a cellar or basement if possible), providing effective escape routes through adjoining walls, and maintaining in good working order a complete set of tools and equipment for post-raid assistance.
