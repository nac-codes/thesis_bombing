Only 12 million gas masks were distributed, again on the assumption that most people would not  Page 234 of 562 AN% ater Ee pee 2 A ee ek EES. 2 ee eee ee TS ee OE ee re Yee Ces, SLA OR Pee eek er Pree ie! ber an axe, a shovel, and armbands for those who were “lay helpers” or wardens."* The intention was to ensure that all citizens assumed responsibility for their own protection, in their own homes; if by telephone with the main police control center in the city.44 Again the object was to ensure that a high degree of community commitment would minimize damage and casualties and remove much characteristics.2 This was the front line on the German home front: ordinary people called upon to perform, if they could, extraordinary acts of heroism. Zone III included small towns and rural areas, or regions too far distant for existing enemy aircraft to reach.18 Only those communities in Zone I were promised state financing to fund civil defense preparations. In late 1938 the association of municipalities complained to Goring that a lack of money for Zones II and III made it difficult either to build public shelters or to provide firefighting equip- need them. A further explanation for the slow and uneven spread of air-raid protection lay in the air force conviction that antiaircraft fire would be sufficiently concentrated to deter enemy aircraft even if they succeeded in penetrating Reich territory, a judgment largely shared at first by the wider German public. For all the fear earlier in the decade that Germany was exposed to a circle of hostile states capable of bombing the German heartland, preparation on the home front came later and on a more limited scale than in either Britain or France. The most obvious deficiency came in the provision of public
