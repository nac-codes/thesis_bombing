able of bombing the German heartland, preparation on the home front came later and on a more limited scale than in either Britain or France. The most obvious deficiency came in the provision of public air-raid shelters and the supply of matériel to make the air defense room (Luftschutzraum) a safe and reliable refuge. The quality of the “room” varied a great deal: sometimes it was an extensive cellar under an apartment block, sometimes little more than a small storeroom or a corridor. Most German industrial regions were of recent construction and the communal housing was large in scale and concentrated, though there was usually a basement or cellar. Older housing varied, though the evidence suggests that few people in the threatened cities did not have access to local domestic shelter of some kind. Guidelines were regularly published about the ideal “room,” which had to be gasproof, blastproof, clearly indicated, clear of obstructions, and provided with lighting and seating: “Everything prepared for the emergency!”*4 In the summer of 1939, the Air Ministry calculated that it would cost 50 reichsmarks (RM) per person to provide adequate shelter for the 60 million people who needed it, a total of 3 billion marks for which the money was simply not available.22 The gap between ideal and reality was difficult to breach, and cellars and basements had to be slowly improved over the war years. The same problems existed with public shelters. In late 1939, for example, it was discovered that the shelter program for schools was well behind schedule, particularly in the areas outside Zone I. Many schools in more remote areas had neither cellar nor basement and had to be provided with trench shelters covered  Page 234 of 562 A% difficult situation, trustworthiness, pleasure in responsibility.”1® Regular circulars were sent around in the war with stories of heroic individuals displaying, it is to be supposed, some or all of these characteristics.4” This was the front line on the
