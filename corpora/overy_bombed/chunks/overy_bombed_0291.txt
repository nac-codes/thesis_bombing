mixed success. The main law covering the blackout was issued on May 23, 1939, with a subsidiary order on domestic lighting issued on September 1, the day Germany attacked Poland.%® All householders had a responsibility to ensure that the blackout was effective; in offices or commercial buildings one designated person was held to be responsible, in multistory apartment blocks one person was required to extinguish the lights in the halls and stairwells. In the first months of the war blackout discipline was variable. Building sites and factories showed more light than permitted; street lighting was 60 percent gas-fired and more difficult to turn off and on than electric lighting, so in many cities dim lighting remained. Helpful propaganda and advice were liberally supplied to help the population cope with the sudden plunge into darkness. In March 1940, Himmler, as chief of police, issued detailed guidelines on blackout behavior that included walking on sidewalks no more than two abreast, and avoiding excessive alcohol: “Drunk pedestrians bring not only themselves, but others into danger.” Blackout infringements brought regular fines of up to 150 RM, but later on householders could also have their electricity supply cut off as a reminder not to leave a light showing.22 State-sponsored evacuation against bombing was, by contrast, almost nonexistent. In October 1939, Géring announced that there would be no assisted evacuation from the threatened urban areas, though plans could be made to transfer schoolchildren if necessary. Voluntary evacuation was neither prevented nor encouraged. Decisions on evacuation were reserved for Géring himself.*° The initial wartime movements of population were away from the frontier (Red Zone) opposite France, only loosely connected with the bombing threat. Not until October 1940, more than a year after the start of the war, and six months after the start of British bombing, did the first trainloads of children leave Berlin at Hitler’s inst
