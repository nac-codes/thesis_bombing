ntline mentality. Bombing was geographically restricted and distributed in small packets over villages Berlin or the Ruhr cities, and what small damage occurred there was quickly repaired or covered by wooden fencing.*4 Security Service (Sicherheitsdienst, or SD) reports of the first few raids indicated that the population kept calm, except in places where the air-raid sirens failed to sound.*® Air-raid discipline proved they saw a light.”2° But when the bombing spread to Berlin in late August, the same pattern became evident and sterner warnings had to be issued. In September the president of the Luftschutzbund, became heavier and more deadly.*” During the summer and autumn of 1940 the population viewed the war differently from the embattled British under the German Blitz; buoyed up by the sense of a historic victory and expecting Britain soon to abandon the war, they did not seem to view the bombing with the same sense of battle. The regular bombing nevertheless forced the German government to accelerate the program for better protection and to ensure regular welfare. Since the attacks were small and irregular, the costs could be absorbed with relative ease. From the start the government agreed that compensation would be paid for injuries or losses sustained as a result of enemy air action, perhaps unaware of what such a commitment might mean in the long term. After the first raid in mid-May 1940 the Interior Ministry reminded all local authorities that compensation for bomb damage, or loss of livelihood or removal of personal possessions, was a direct charge on the Reich.*® The question of loss of earnings was more difficult, since it would mean paying workers for doing nothing while they sat in the air- raid shelter or took time off while their work premises were repaired.
