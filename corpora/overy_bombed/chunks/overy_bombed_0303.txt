or the smallest localities, and outside them.”*® Villages were helped by the local police, but the rural population was expected to form “rural air-protection communities” as would be repaired in thirty-six hours, and all plasterwork repaired in four days. These were promises not difficult to fulfill as long as the damage remained modest.*2 started that saw the number of places in public shelters expand from 51,000 in April 1940 to 233,207 a year later; by the time of Operation Gomorrah, the bombing of the city in July 1943, around three-quarters of the cellars had been converted to air-raid rooms.*? In other cities, schemes were set up to strengthen the air-raid rooms by providing a reinforced ceiling, props, and escape routes, but shortages of matériel and labor made it difficult to complete the work. In Minster around 5,000 cellars were improved between the autumn of 1940 and the spring of 1941, but a survey in early 1942 showed that still only 4.7 percent of the population had rooms that were considered entirely safe in a raid.*4 In Berlin in the autumn of 1940 only one-tenth of the capital’s population had air- raid rooms, partly on the assumption that it was relatively safe from long-range bomb attack, which it was not. Following the first raids on the city in August 1940, Hitler ordered a program to build between 1,000 and 2,000 bunkers in Berlin, each capable of holding 100 people. He told the air-protection authorities that “damage to property was bearable, but in no case were human losses.” Every house had to have its own air-protection room, if possible with light, heating, and somewhere to sleep, and the cost would now be borne by the state.** On October 10, Hitler finally published an “Immediate Program” empowering the Air Ministry to undertake an extensive program to ensure that the urban population had access to a proper air-raid room, as well as bunkers and shelters for businesses, schools, museums, galleries, and ministries.** The cost in labor, ce
