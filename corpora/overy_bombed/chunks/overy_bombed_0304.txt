e program to ensure that the urban population had access to a proper air-raid room, as well as bunkers and shelters for businesses, schools, museums, galleries, and ministries.** The cost in labor, cement, and iron in an economy already facing rigorous restrictions and priorities proved impossible to meet, and in mid-1941 and again in December that year, work on larger bunkers was curtailed where possible in favor of blastproof trenches and reinforced cellars.*” Nevertheless, concrete bunkers were built both above and below ground in the major threatened cities, particularly in the Ruhr-Rhineland. In Cologne a total of at least 58 were built between 1940 and 1942, 15 of them concentrated in the inner city center.*® In all, some seventy-six cities undertook to construct a total of 2,055 bunker shelters between November 1941 and 1943, of which 1,215 were finished by early 1942, though not yet fully equipped. Shortages of matériel and the competing claims of armaments production, the Atlantic Wall defenses (which consumed twice as much concrete as the bunker program), and the giant concrete pens for submarines meant that much of the program remained incomplete by the time the heaviest raids began in 1943.*° Even this number of new shelters could provide only a fraction of the population with protection. The first wave of building up until the summer of 1941 provided places for 500,000; a second, smaller wave resulted in places for 740,000 by the summer of 1943, or only 3.87 percent of the population in the seventy-six cities involved. There were in addition converted cellars and air-raid rooms for 11.6 million, though many were scarcely bombproof. For millions of Germans there was no immediate prospect of secure shelter, particularly in the cities ranked in Zones II and III, which became the object of heavy at-  se We Vet eae fel eae  Page 243 of 562 42% arene” ae, — ae, — ete “tea — Dee “tierra, — Dietitian ee tari, — Te ata eta” aac ete baie — and repairs “even in sm
