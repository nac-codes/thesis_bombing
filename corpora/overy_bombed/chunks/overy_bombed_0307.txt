ion of Normandy in June 1944.§% reorientation made it more important for the German state and the party to be able to provide sufficient support to prevent bombing from damaging domestic support for the war effort. In 1940 only 950 people had been killed in all the bomb attacks (which suggests that the air-raid cellar offered better protection than the authorities feared). In 1941 the level of civilian casualties and damage to property began steadily to increase. In Minster there were 24 raids between July and December 1940, which killed 8 and wounded 59; just 3 raids in July 1941 killed 43 and injured 196. In Hamburg, 69 attacks in 1940 had resulted in 125 deaths and 567 injured; a further 143 raids up to the time of Gomorrah in July 1943 killed 1,431, injured 4,657, and left 24,000 temporarily homeless.® In 1941 an estimated 5,029 were killed and perhaps 12,000 injured in a total of 295 raids. Small though these statistics are by comparison with the casualties of the Blitz, it represented the first serious loss of civilian life for a population more accustomed to the roll call of the military dead.® During 1941 the pattern of RAF bombing also changed. From spring onward, bombers carried a higher proportion of incendiaries and began to concentrate them more effectively. Training in fighting incendiaries had been part of routine civil defense education, but now detailed pamphlets were issued on every type of British incendiary device with instructions on how to tackle them, including the recommendation to wear a gas mask. The schedule for self-protection classes was changed so that almost all the practical elements were devoted to fighting fire and extinguishing incendiaries. Training centers had an “air-protection exercise house” where trainees learned to overcome any anxieties about tackling a real fire by exposure to a controlled blaze.® Géring put his name to a list of ten principles to observe when combating incendiaries, under the slogans “Incendiary bombs mus
