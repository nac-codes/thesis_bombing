Goebbels told the gauleiters that the watchwords were “unity and planning.””© The choice of the new commissar was not an obvious one, and his actual powers, formally under Goéring’s authority, in which the party claimed a role. They included controlling behavior in shelters, checking on the blackout, supplying candidates for air-raid warden who possessed the home front. The gauleiter of Munich later recalled that from 1942 onward his work came to consist almost entirely of “defence from the enemy air war, activation of civilian air protection.””8 The claims of the party had the paradoxical effect of demilitarizing the home front, as the air force role was confined progressively to the more evidently military aspects of air defense.

The other competitor was Géring, whose role as general overseer of air defense was challenged by Goebbels’s new powers.
