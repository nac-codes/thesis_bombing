bings of Liibeck and Rostock, cities were encouraged to develop an “action mentality” by creating an Einsatzstab (action staff) under a designated Einsatzfiihrer (action leader), who was to be chosen from among the local air protection leaders as an individual of outstanding merit. The staff was to consist of representatives of all the local state and party offices for welfare, food, building, repair, transport, and local economy, but the leader was the key figure, given temporary emergency powers to get help from within and outside the raided area and to apply it swiftly and ruthlessly to the catastrophe.® “Self-protection” was to be strengthened by creating local “self-protection squads” (Selbstschutztruppen) run by yet another lower-level Einsatzfiihrer whose job was to tackle raids on streets and small communities in a more ministry at once if help was needed. Goebbels told the gauleiters that the watchwords were “unity and planning.””* The choice of the new commissar was not an obvious one, and his actual powers, “Luftschutz-NSDAP” sewn on them to show that they were independent of the air force or police. In the autumn of 1940, Martin Bormann, Hess's deputy, drew up a list of nine civil defense activities Goring, and Wilhelm Frick, the interior minister representing the interest of the police and local authorities, drew up a formal document confirming the new pattern of responsibility between them. In December 1942, Géring issued a further directive to try to make the setup clearer: in the event of a catastrophic raid, beyond the scope of the Reich defense commissar or the air protection leader, help should be requested from the Party Chancellery, the Propaganda Ministry, and the Interior Ministry. But this arrangement merely confirmed a state of improvised confusion.®?
