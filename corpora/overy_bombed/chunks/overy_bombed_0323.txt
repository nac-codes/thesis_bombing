The salvaged goods had to be left in the street, clearly marked (to prevent looting), where they were collected in municipal street-cleaning trucks or military vehicles and stored in requisitioned warehouses or shops. Glass from the shattered windows was quickly cleaned up and returned to glassmakers for recycling.®” The guidelines for rehousing, house repair, and compensation were laid down in a number of decrees issued by the Interior Ministry and the Organisation Todt in the course of 1941.8* In Schéneberg, housing was tackled at once by a special unit (Baugruppe Pfeil) organized by the city mayor.
