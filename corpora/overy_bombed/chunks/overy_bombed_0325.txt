rse of 1941.8* In Schéneberg, was to do no more than ensure that the buildings could be lived in—roofs covered over with boards or broken slates and tiles replaced.®® In the aftermath of the Berlin raid there were 300 roofers, 460 necessary resoluteness in returning to homes that were now far less comfortable places to live.®° Most of the light damage from Allied bombing consisted of broken windows and damaged roofs. Three and 973 severely damaged, making it possible for those rendered homeless, as in Britain, to return to where they had lived after first-aid repairs were completed.®! It was calculated that 324,000 homes consuming and the regulations irksome to those who saw themselves as victims. At the emergency centers, the bombed-out were given preliminary vouchers for clothes, shoes, soap, and laundry detergent, without having to make a formal written application. Clothes included a suit or a dress, underwear, stockings, handkerchiefs and nightwear, and one pair of sturdy shoes. In March 1943 the welfare offices handed out 10,432 textile vouchers and 10,810 for shoes and 750 furniture certificates. So complex was the rationing system in Germany set up in September 1939 that bomb damage could destroy cards for household articles, furniture, coal, petrol, soap, and tobacco, all of which had to be queued for, often for hours, in order to argue for a replacement. The new card or voucher was an entitlement only, whose redemption depended on the local supply of goods. Schéneberg was fortunate since there were stocks of secondhand goods and Jewish possessions, as well as goods from occupied or Axis Europe, France and Hungary in particular. In the spring of 1943 Hitler had ordered that labor and materials needed to overcome bomb damage and losses should be secured first from the occupied territories.** Berlin still had a large number of small traders and manufacturers who could supply what else was needed, and the stocks used up in March 1943 were soon replenished.**
