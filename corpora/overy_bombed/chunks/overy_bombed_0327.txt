A report from the Schoneberg regional office explained that the officials and the claimants worked in different directions, the including, at times, photographs of the missing objects. Where the owner had been killed, legatees gave their own description of what they had expected to inherit. The officials based their assessments on the credibility of the claimant, including estimates of social class and likely earnings, as a guide to what a claimant might possibly own. One Berlin toolmaker claimed 12,000 RM of furnishings from a one-room apartment, including 143 separate items; the claims office dismissed the claim and paid out 1,500 RM.

In Nuremberg alone, there were 27,977 claims for compensation by the spring of 1943, amounting to 44.8 million marks; of this sum 8.8 million were paid out in cash, 14 million in kind.*® By late 1943 payments at the national level were running at over 700 million RM a month; claims totaling 31.7 billion RM had been filed, of which 11.6 billion had already been paid out.®2 These were sums that could never have been imagined when the initial commitment was made to pay for the direct costs of the bombing war. The greatest test of the evolving civil defense and emergency structure came with the bombing of H
