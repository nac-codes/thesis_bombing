n were paid out in cash, 14 million in kind.*8 By late 1943 payments at the national level were shelter was available for 378,000 people; attics had been cleared, fire-risk stocks had been stored safely, and a program of fire-retarding wood treatment—the “Fire Protection Chemical Scheme”— had been ordered in spring 1943 for completion by the summer. There was a large cohort of 9,300 Luftschutzpolizei, and a citywide fire-watching scheme, which involved 15,000 people in the dock area alone. There had been 11,000 demonstrations organized in the city on how to extinguish incendiary bombs. Some 70,000 men and women had been trained for first aid by the German Red Cross. Hamburg’s police president later in the year described the city as “one large Air Protection community.”!~ The heavy British raids on other cities earlier in the year gave little indication of what Hamburg could expect in Operation Gomorrah. An attack on Stuttgart on April 14-15 had killed 118; a heavy raid on Dortmund on May 23-24 left 345 dead; another on Krefeld in June resulted in 149 deaths.1°2 Hamburg itself had suffered 626 deaths in forty-two raids in 1941, 494 deaths in fifteen raids in 1942, and 142 deaths in ten small raids in 1943. The first reports to reach Berlin of the Ham- burg bombing gave little indication of how much more serious the raids in Operation Gomorrah proved to be.1% Hamburg was not unprepared for its ordeal, but the scale of the three nights of attack on July 24-25, 27-28, and 29-30 overwhelmed the thousands of trained personnel. After declaring a state of emergency, the Reich defense commissar, gauleiter Karl Kaufmann, called in mutual assistance from outside the city from as far away as Dresden. At the height of the crisis there were 14,000 fire- fighters. 12.000 soldiers. and 8.000 emergencv workers. but although thev were able to achieve limited containment of the fire area. the conflagrations soon grew out of control. consuming evervthing  Page 255 of 562 44% and 973 se
