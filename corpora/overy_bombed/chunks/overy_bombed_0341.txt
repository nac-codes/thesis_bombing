A Cologne journalist recorded in his diary how well his neighbors coped with the 1,000-bomber raid in May 1942: “The incendiaries which clattered down around our house: one on the balcony of our neighbor Feuser, immediately extinguished by our neighbor Brassart, one in front of the garage of our neighbor Uhlenbruck, which the coal merchant snatched up, one by the garage of neighbor Gessert, which the householder put out.”!2” For the regular fire service, the onset of heavy firebombing raids placed a strain on units that were already depleted by regular culls of manpower for the armed forces. In September 1943 a second national inspector was appointed for the fire service, Hans Rumpf, who made it his job to visit more than 150 fire-service units over the following year, checking their equipment and practices. The system depended increasingly on volunteer firefighters, around 1.7 million by 1944. After the heavy fire raids in 1943, the local volunteers were organized in “firefighting emergency units” so that they could be summoned at once from the surrounding area to help with fires in the major cities, an estimated 700 units made up of 100,000 firefighters. They were all brought under police jurisdiction, and those who were also members of the SS were permitted to wear the familiar silver runes on their uniform. The numbers of German men in the service fell steadily, so that during 1943 it became necessary to recruit foreign workers—Poles, Czechs, and Ukrainians—into the fire service. In Hamburg by the end of the war around one-quarter of the regular fire service was made up o
