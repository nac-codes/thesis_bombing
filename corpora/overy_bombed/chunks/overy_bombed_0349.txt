medical needs to the evacuee community, and since the majority were children, old people, and women, many of them pregnant, the need for doctors, child nurses, and midwives was more rather than less urgent. In the reception areas the problem was made worse by the fact that the armed forces had taken many of the doctors from the zones classified II or III, not having realized the extent of the later bombing threat.12° The aim of the Reich health chief, Leonardo Conti (one of those responsible for the T4 “euthanasia” program), was to try to keep an acceptable proportion between the population and the number of doctors, but by October 1943 the profession was down to 35,000 for the whole population, from a prewar level of 80,000.

The ideal of one doctor for every 2,000 or 2,500 people could not be met, and of those available, many were themselves the victims of overwork, tiredness, and illness. For evacuees Conti's aim was only one doctor for every 10,000.14° The onset of heavy bombing made it necessary to find a solution or risk a breakdown of effective medical services.
