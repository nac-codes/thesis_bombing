The difference is that 1944, Hitler addressed the leaders of German war production on what had been achieved “despite the growing damage from air attacks.” The new peak in war production achieved in August, he continued, showed that German industry could be trusted, even in the shrunken and battered area still remaining to Germany, to concentrate everything on war production “in order to be able to in- crease yet further the output of the most important weapons and equipment.”!”5 If the “miracle” of expanded German production has very material explanations in the effective exploitation of both capital and labor and efforts to rationalize the distribution of resources, the ability to sustain exceptional levels of war production in the face of the bombing offensive cannot be taken for granted. If bombing eventually placed a ceiling on what could be produced, the perform- ance of the key sectors of German industry over the last two years of war did have something of an “economic miracle” about it. Above all, it was the exact reverse of what the Allies thought would be possible once the offensive got going, as the statistics in table 4.1 make evident. Whatever the other resource and organizational issues confronting the German war economy, which is not the subject here, the extent to which German war economic potential could be safeguarded against the impact of bombing became a central concern of the German war machine and allowed the armed forces to continue fighting forlorn campaigns well into 1945.
