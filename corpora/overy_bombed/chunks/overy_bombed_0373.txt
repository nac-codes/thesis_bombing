After 1933, with the new it in relatively bomb-safe areas in central, southern, and eastern Germany, a process known as Verballung, literally, breaking up the industrial “ball.” German territorial expansion in 1938-40 ensured that the balance of industrial output in the enlarged “Greater Germany” tilted farther east, creating a cushion to absorb any potential damage done to the Ruhr-Rhineland. The Ruhr supplied three- quarters of German iron and steel output in 1939 but less than two-thirds by 1943.16 The vast Reichswerke “Hermann Goring,” a state holding company for iron, steel, coal, and armaments set up in 1937, controlled 71 firms in Germany but 241 in occupied Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Until 1944 a proportion of German war production was protected by its geographical dispersal and the long aerial ranges needed to reach it. The vulnerability of German industrial and service sectors to bombing was well understood, and “work self-protection” (Werkluftschutz) featured in the 1937 “Self-Protection” law. But like ai raid protection in general, the factory system was introduced piecemeal; those plants farthest from the bombing threat were less inclined to introduce rigorous air-protection procedures for their workforce, provide them with effective shelters, or install blast protection for machinery and equipment. When the Heinkel aircraft plant in Rostock suffered damage in the raids in 1942, it was found that the firm had not followed the Air Ministry’s advice in building protective bomb walls.1” In the cities in Zone I effective work protection was mandatory.
