was found that the firm had not followed the Air Ministry’s advice in building protective bomb walls.1” In the cities in Zone I effective work protection was mandatory. From 1939 onward, vulnerable firms were asked to transfer some of their production to less endangered areas, and an effort was made, as in Britain, to ensure that vital components or even whole products (aircraft, aero-engines, tanks, etc.) were produced in at least three geographically distinct sites. Some of this early dispersal was effective—the Weser aircraft works at Bremen moved one-third of its production of the Ju87 Stuka to Berli:  a fe as 3,188 140,454 Artiller Over 5,964 D4 14,316 Aircraft Number 10,250 ~~ ‘11,030 14,700 P44 Wa 8 Submarines Tor 162,000 193,000 221,000 Source: IWM, S363, Saur papers, “Auszug aus dem Leistungsbericht von Minister Speer, 27.1.1945.” quarters of German iron and steel output in 1939 but less than two-thirds by 1943.17 The vast Reichswerke “Hermann Goring,” a state holding company for iron, steel, coal, and armaments set up in The vulnerability of German industrial and service sectors to bombing was well understood, and “work self-protection” (Werkluftschutz) featured in the 1937 “Self-Protection” law. But like air- were produced in at least three geographically distinct sites. Some of this early dispersal was effective—the Weser aircraft works at Bremen moved one-third of its production of the Ju87 Stuka to Berlin; the Focke-Wulf plant, also in Bremen, was decentralized to three separate sites farther east in 1940 and 1941; the Blohm & Voss flying-boat production was transferred from Hamburg to Bodensee, in south Germany, while new capacity was built in areas far removed from the current bombing threat. In 1938-39, Messerschmitt Me109 production was set up at Wiener-Neustadt outside Vienna (five other assembly plants in Austria and Bohemia were added later); another production center was established at the Erla works in Leipzig. None could easily be bombed unt
