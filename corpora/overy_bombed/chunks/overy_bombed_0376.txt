From 1939 onward, vulnerable firms were aimed at the real plant. Decoy sites outside Stuttgart and Karlsruhe attracted well over half of all bombs in 1941.4”? In Berlin elaborate efforts were made to disguise the government quarter to avoid length of gray material laid across it to resemble a road.18° Outside the city, sixteen major dummy industrial sites were set up, which attracted British bombs throughout the war. When firebombing was expanded so that by the end of the war there were 100 smoke companies composed of 50,000 men and women.184  Of the many problems faced by the German economy between 1940 and 1942, bombing was not one of them. Small-scale, incidental damage could be compensated, while dispersal and decoys reduced what limited prospect there was of accurate raiding against economic targets. The German economy from 1939 onward experienced a rapid and extensive transfer to war production prior- ities, cutting private consumer spending by one-quarter by 1942 (against a 14 percent reduction in Britain) and increasing the percentage of workers in manufacturing who produced goods for the armed forces, from 28 percent in May 1939 to 70 percent in May 1942.18 Arms production expanded steadily in the first years of war, though not without considerable difficulties.
