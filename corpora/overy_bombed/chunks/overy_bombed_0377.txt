These were not and uninterrupted mass production. Productive performance was held back as much by poor planning as by potential resource bottlenecks, which only really inhibited war production in Germany at the end of 1944 when bombing, the collapse of the economic New Order, and the disruption of trade finally reduced German access to key materials. The effect of production politics in the first years of war was to hold back the full rationalization of war production. The gradual introduction of a system of production rings and committees in 1941-42 to oversee each branch of production, together with the establishment in March 1942 of an organization for coordinated resource allocation, known as Central Planning, saw the creation of a framework within which the substantial earlier invest-  ment in war output capacity could be
