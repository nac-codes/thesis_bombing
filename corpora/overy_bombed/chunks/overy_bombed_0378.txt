2 of an organization for coordinated resource allocation, known as Central Planning, saw the creation of a framework within which the substantial earlier invest-  ment in war output capacity could be used to expand the supply of armaments exponentially over the last three years of war.1®3  Bombing became one of the factors that German industry had to take more fully into account only during 1943 and early 1944, as a result of the RAF campaigns against the Ruhr, Hamburg, and Berlin, and the American attacks on aircraft production and ball-bearing factories. Although the Ruhr campaign led to a temporary reduction in iron and steel supply, it failed to halt the upward direc- tion of German war production, which reached new peaks during 1943. The main Krupp works in Essen lost only 7.6 percent of its planned output in 1943; the giant August-Thyssen concern produced quarters of German iron and steel output in 1939 but less than two-thirds by 1943.17° The vast Reichswerke “Hermann Goring,” a state holding company for iron, steel, coal, and armaments set up in was expanded so that by the end of the war there were 100 smoke companies composed of 50,000 men and women.124 ment in war output capacity could be used to expand the supply of armaments exponentially over the last three years of war.18 more iron in 1943 than in either of the previous two years.1®4 At the same time sales of iron and steel from the new plants in central Germany and occupied eastern Europe controlled by the Reichswerke “Hermann Goring” expanded by 87 percent between 1941 and 1943 to compensate for declining Ruhr production. The Reichswerke supplied one-fifth of all iron and steel, one-quarter of German coal.185 Bombing, as already noted in chapter 3, only reduced potential German industrial output by around 9 percent in 1943. That loss has to be set against a threefold expansion of war production between 1941 and 1944 evident for all major classes of weapons. Total munitions output for large-caliber ar
