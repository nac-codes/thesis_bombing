d 9 percent in 1943. That loss has to be set against a threefold expansion of war production between 1941 and 1944 evident for all major classes of weapons. Total munitions output for large-caliber artillery was 100 percent greater in 1943 than 1942, production of tank guns 60 percent higher, aircraft output up by 61 percent; in 1944 these statistics were once again exceeded by a wide margin. Bombing caused local and temporary dislocation, but could not prevent German industry from adapting to the pressures and expanding output.1®° The central problem facing the German war economy in the last years of war was not the bombing but the escalating loss rates at the fighting front. In the first years of the war, losses of both manpower and equipment had been relatively low; from the Stalingrad battles on the Eastern Front to the collapse of Axis forces in North Africa and the rising attrition in the Battle of the Atlantic, the toll on Germany’s armed forces escalated sharply. The demand for higher production reflected higher losses and the subsequent demands from the armed forces for more rapid and extensive replacement of stocks. Army stocks of tanks and self-propelled guns on hand were by 1944 almost four times greater than in 1941; stocks of antitank guns five times ereater than in 1942: the sunnlv of aircraft. both new and renaired. exnanded from a monthlv average of 1.381 in 1940 to an average of 3.609 in 1944182 The continuous camnaienine in rr =  — that the firm had not followed the Air Ministry’s advice in building protective bomb walls.
