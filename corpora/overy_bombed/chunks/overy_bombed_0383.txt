policy was working well. Stocks were moved to the edge of the endangered cities and stored by small firms more remote from the threat of attack.1%° The result was that even in cities badly hit, it was still possible to maintain a large proportion of pre-raid production. In Augsburg, for example, where industry was among the most heavily damaged, the average value of monthly production was 964,000 RM in the last five months of 1943; in the five months of heavy raiding in 1944 the average was 814,000 RM. In Hagen, hit by four heavy attacks in 1943, the pre-raid average value was 5.2 million RM, the post-raid value 5.17 million. Much of any loss was absorbed by cutting consumer production and concentrating on war-essential products.12+ The second necessity was to ensure that the working population in the bombed cities could be assisted enough to ensure that labor productivity was maintained and absenteeism kept to a minimum. This was a more complex problem by 1943 because of the introduction of an increasing number of foreign compulsory workers and the rising proportion of women in the workforce, though in both cases work discipline could be imposed more ruthlessly by male German supervisors. Foreign workers were treated as effective captives; they had restricted access to air-raid shelters or had to make do with slit trenches, so as to emphasize the difference in status between them and skilled German workers. In a controlled economy, with no right to strike and heavy penalties for dissent, worker unrest could still be displayed through slow working or sabotage. It remained in the interest of employers and the state to ensure that the German labor force was given both stick and carrot to keep it productive. Priority was given to repairing workers’ housing or replacing it with temporary barracks. Workers engaged in repair work following a raid were given a bonus of between 52 and 65 percent an hour depending on their particular skills.1% Workers who were rendered home
