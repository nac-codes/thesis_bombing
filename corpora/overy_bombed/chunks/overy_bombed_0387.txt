omponent contractors./°° The Air Ministry had already begun a program of dispersal in October 1942, when orders were issued to move all production out of the most endangered areas and to ensure that each product was manufactured in at least two or three different places. Sometimes by chance the same component was bombed simultaneously in two separate places—a Ju87 component, for example, in two raids on Bremen and Osnabriick in 1942—but in general multiple production gave an added cushion of flexibility. By November 1942 most of the 290 businesses producing 100 percent for the air force west of the line Stettin-Berlin-Munich had dispersal plans prepared.2% Over the following months much aircraft production was moved to the Protectorate, Slovakia, Poland, Silesia, and Saxony, but there still remained much to be done by the time Hitler published his decree in June 1943.

Stocks were moved to the edge of the endangered cities and stored by small firms more remote from the threat of attack.4%° The result was that even in cities value was 5.2 million RM, the post-raid value 5.17 million.
