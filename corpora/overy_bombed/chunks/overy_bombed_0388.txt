population in raided cities, predominantly in the western industrial areas: fifty grams of extra was almost certainly a safer place to be than at home.1°° Yet in the end the greatest incentive for workers to remain at work was the need for regular wages to support them and their families, and the up.t22 where production was to be dispersed.1*8 Two weeks later Speer’s ministry sent out orders implementing the decree, which included a prohibition on any “wild dispersal” undertaken without approval would allow them to keep their workforce intact and maintain links with local service and component contractors.!®° The Air Ministry had already begun a program of dispersal in October 1942, when The next month, Goring, as “Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan,” ordered complete “evacuation of war-essential industry from the core of major cities.”2% The success of the dispersal policy, which allowed German production to expand significantly despite the escalating bombardment, can best be illustrated by looking at the two industries chosen by the U.S. Eighth Air Force as potential bottlenecks: ball bearings and aircraft assembly. Both cases demonstrate the substantial cushion available in a heavily industrialized state when manufacture needed to be decentralized. The potentially disruptive effects of this process were mitigated by the simultaneous insistence, laid down in regular orders from Hitler himself, on simplifying and stand- ardizing production and design, concentrating on a narrow range of model types, searching for substitute materials or parts for those in short supply, and eliminating any production, whether civilian or military, that was classified as less essential. Bombing forced the German productive system to become more flexible and improvisatory in ways that the Allied air forces had not anticipated. The attack on the production of ball bearings at Schweinfurt failed in its purpose for just this reason. Four days after the attack, Speer flew to Nuremberg
