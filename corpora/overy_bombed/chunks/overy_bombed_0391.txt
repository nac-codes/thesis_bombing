assembly plants were divided among 729 smaller units, though in the end only around 300 were used; aero-engine output was divided from 51 plants (in many cases already dispersed once) to 249 new sites.

By the time ball-bearing supply was back to its pre-raid level, aircraft production was 58 percent greater, tank production 54 percent.2& end of 1943 some 3.3 million square meters had been made available as dispersed capacity, but the new programs involved a further 2.4 million.2™ The result was a complex mosaic of productive sites for each of the main producers. The Erla works in Leipzig, making up one-third of Me109 production, was split up among 18 dispersal plants, 13 component plants, and 5 main assembly points, and although output was temporarily safeguarded, the six-month transfer of production lines cost 2,800 lost aircraft. The Me109 production at Wiener-Neustadt also had to be decentralized in the spring of 1944, and once again was undertaken with mixed success because sites were chosen where too much new installation and reconstruction was needed. Efficiency was hit by the requirement to have no unit ca
