f the 290 businesses producing 100 percent for the air force west of the line Stettin-Berlin-Munich had dispersal plans prepared.?” Over the following The next month, Géring, as “Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan,” ordered complete “evacuation of war-essential industry from the core of major cities.”2° the Gothaer Waggonfabrik in Gotha was more successfully dispersed after the raids in February, so that full production was restored after only a few weeks.2~ The whole dispersal policy ensured that firm’s leadership corps; more workers were engaged indirectly on military orders for which they had not been trained, or other workers (usually foreign or camp laborers) had to be transferred from one camp barrack to another; shorter production runs undermined the time and cost savings of large-scale assembly; tools and jigs had to be supplied in multiples, though in this case the large number of general-purpose machine tools available in Germany made the transfer to fragmented production easier to carry out. Above all, dispersal placed strains on the communications system and in particular on the carefully controlled distribution of equipment and parts run by the Armaments Ministry, designed to ensure that components and tools only arrived at the time and in the quantities needed. With an exceptional amount of organizational and laboring effort, German industry succeeded in maximizing production despite the obstacles presented by dispersal. The object, as one man- ager put it, was for “the impossible to be made possible.”2> Doing the impossible might well have described the coincidence of peak bombing and peak production. The factors that kept war production expanding during 1942 and 1943 played a critical part in sustaining the expansion of output during 1944. The concentration of production on the most essential equipment reached its high point in the spring of 1944 as older models of weapons and equipment were eliminated and standard models introduced.
