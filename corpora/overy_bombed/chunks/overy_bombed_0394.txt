tration of production on the most essential equipment reached its high point in the spring of 1944 as older models of weapons and equipment were eliminated and standard models introduced. Types of light infantry weapons were to be reduced from fourteen to five, antitank weapons from twelve to just one, antiaircraft guns from ten to two; the number of vehicle models was reduced from fifty-five to fourteen; and so on.?° All inessential or nonmilitary manufacture was combed through one more time to weed out unneeded production: the 117 firms still making carpets were reduced to 5; the 23 firms making 300 types of prismatic glass were reduced to 7, making just 14 types; the 900 machine-tool firms were reduced to 369. _ Where possible, the floor space and labor were allocated to direct military output.

By the time ball-bearing supply was back to its pre-raid level, aircraft production was 58 percent greater, tank production 54 percent.?° the Gothaer Waggonfabrik in Gotha was more successfully dispersed after the raids in February, so that full production was restored after only a few weeks.2% The whole dispersal policy ensured that ager put it, was for “the impossible to be made possible.”2% guns from ten to two; the number of vehicle models was reduced from fifty-five to fourteen; and so on.2% All inessential or nonmilitary manufacture was combed through one more time to weed out were reduced to 369.
