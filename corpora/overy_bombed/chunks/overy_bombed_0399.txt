In July 1943, Hitler asked that production of the new A4 rocket (the later V-2) should be made fe as possible from bombing, preferably underground; Himmler undertook to carry it out because he had access to a rapidly expanding concentration camp population for the supply of labor. The Air Ministry had already asked the mining section of the Economics Ministry to compile a list of all potential sites in Germany and the nearest occupied territories with underground floor space for the aeronautical industry to escape the raid: The list of possible sites ran to twenty-two pages, fifteen with German locations, seven more for those identified in Hungary, Slovakia, Bohemia/Moravia, and Poland.
