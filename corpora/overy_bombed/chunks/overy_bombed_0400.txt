bombing of key industries, comprehensive plans were drawn up for a colossal construction program to embrace eventually 93 million square meters of underground room, to include additional programs for oil and SS projects, among them the A4 rocket.

Interest in the program was generated from a number of quarters. In July 1943, Hitler asked that production of the new A4 rocket (the later V-2) should be made as safe as possible from bombing, preferably underground; Himmler undertook to compile a list of all potential sites in Germany and the nearest occupied territories with underground floor space for the aeronautical industry to escape the raids.2"4 The list of possible sites ran to Table 4.3: Programs of Underground Construction, November 1944 (m7)  Planned Abandoned Under Completed  Construction  Airframes 20,766,800 645,000 16,570,400  — 3,550,800 6,391,400 5,347,700 1,043,720  production firms surveyed by the ministry actually increased from 976 million in March to 1,063 million in October.22 One explanation is that the large proportion of foreign, prisoner of war, and absented themselves permanently—a
