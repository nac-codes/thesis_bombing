seven more for those identified in Hungary, Slovakia, Bohemia/Moravia, and Poland. Limited pr as made in 1943, but in the spring of 1944, with the onset of more targeted bombing y industries, comprehensive plans were draw r a colossal construction program to embrac illion square meters of underground room, to include additional programs for oil and SS projects, among them the A4 rocket. The distribution of underground plants, planned, completed, and ir in hand, is set out in table 4.3.

Only 17 percent of the program was completed by the end of 1944, and not all of that was occupied or functioning by the end of the war. The initial program was designed to get air production into shelters so that increased output of planes could be used to turn back the bombers and perhaps render the rest of the program redundant. By May 1944 some 10 percent of aircraft construction was underground, more by the end of the year. Saur developed a plan to create large underground sites in Hu
