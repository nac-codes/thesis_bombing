nder the rest of the program redundant. By May 1944 some 10 percent of aircraft construction was underground, more by the end of the year. Saur developed a plan to create large underground sites in Hungary, first for fighter aircraft, then one for fuel oil, finally an integrated plant for weapons, munitions, and vehicles, even though the Red Army was now within striking distance. The underground program has always been viewed as a waste of resources: “burrowing away from reality” was the judgment of the British Bombing Survey Unit.*” It is true that most of the dispersal underground was wasted effort. The transfer of BMW aero-engine output into salt mines began in May 1944 and was scheduled for occupation by December, but was not in the end utilized. The access shafts were narrow, the subterranean corridors only ten to thirty meters wide, the salt a threat to the workforce and the machinery. Many of the underground installations suffered from poor ventilation, condensation, and the danger of rockfalls; conditions for workers were so poor that preference was given to using the captive workforce, ch in the case of BMW made up 13,000 out of 17,000 at the main plant. By the time the vast Volkswagen works at Wolfsburg was ordered to disperse underground in August 1944, only 15 percent of its 17,000 workers were German.2!° It is nonetheless difficult to see what other long-term solution remained to a regime that 51% Tanks 2. 109,000 1,818,400 290,500 Motor vehicle 2,808,360 2,711,500 96,800 V-weapon 1,538,700 387,400 1,151,300 Shipbuilding l, Weapons Z Machine tools 7, 775,400 1,248,200 527,200 173,500 9,119,720 53,800 101,600 079,400 1,022,200 Total 65,657,460 1,990,000 52,153,720 11,513,120 Source: TNA, AIR 10/3873, BBSU, “German Experience in the Underground Transfer of War Industries,” 12. to get aircraft production into shelters so that increased output of planes could be used to turn back the bombers and perhaps render the rest of the program redundant.
