could only be solved by either finding effective ways of sheltering it from the bombs or giving up the conflict. Allied bombing was at its most dangerous in 1944 when it targeted large capital projects in oil and chemicals that could not easily be moved or substituted, unlike ball bearings or aircraft. Following amount of equipment had been installed. German fuel supply relied in the end on being able to repair quickly enough the damage to the existing plants.*!” The problems posed by trying to repair machines replaced, or vital components and equipment supplied. The weekly reports on economic conditions produced by the Economics Ministry throughout 1944 reiterate the problems presented by interrupted rail lines and damaged rolling stock.21® The department heads from Speer’s renamed War Production Ministry all highlighted in their postwar interrogations the damage to production imposed because repairs could not be effected or components and parts supplied.?!° This situation was exacerbated by the decision to disperse production often long distances from the main plant. At the Henschel aircraft works, 200 couriers were on hand to collect and distribute vital materials and parts to and from subcontractors in order to keep production going at all.?2° Given the artificial concentration on war production at all costs, the chronic stress on the workforce laboring sixty to seventy hours a week, and the rapid contraction of the European supply base, there were limits to how far the German war economy could be pushed, even without the effects of bombing. The economist John Kenneth Galbraith, drafted to assess the German economy at the end of the war, judged that in 1944 German production, bombing or not, was approaching “what might be called a general bottleneck.”2*1 The weight of attack from September 1944 on a taut economic structure confirmed that the German war economy had reached its limit. There was a sudden increase in the number of firms reporting air-raid damage. I
