t, production collapsed rapidly as the encircling armies and the enveloping air fleets tightened their noose around the German neck.  The German leadership continued, nevertheless, to throw emergency solutions at a collapsing structure. On August 1, 1944, an armaments staff responsible for eight priority production programs was established, bringing together under the direction of Speer and Saur twenty-five department heads with supreme authority to squeeze what weapons they could out of the shrinking economic base. In December 1944, Germany was divided into seven armament zones (Riistungsbezirke), in each of which an autonomous military economy was supposed to flourish. Production declined by more than half. During the last weeks of the war the system continued to hover between fantasy and reality. The army planned a slimmed-down “storm program” for army weapons, deciding what the forces could do without while still able to keep on fighting successfully.2%4 In early March, Speer set up an emergency “transport staff” to coordinate all communications; on March 8 he finally established  three armaments plenipotentiaries in areas he thought were suitable for an “autarkic economy.” One was based in Heidelberg, one in Prague, and one in the Rhine-Ruhr, just days before its surrender.??>  Bombing critically affected the German productive economy only during the last months of the war, but even though a ceiling was placed on further expansion, war production continued to increase until the crisis provoked by the loss of territory, the failure of the dispersal schemes, and the collapse of the repair cycle. A combination of effective work protection, control of the workforce, concealment and deception, dispersal of key production, and insistent policies on concentration and rationalization had succeeded in limiting the damage that air attack could inflict on industry, though not on the cityscapes and urban populations that surrounded it.
