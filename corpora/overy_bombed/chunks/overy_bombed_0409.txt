onalization had succeeded in limiting the damage that air attack could inflict on industry, though not on the cityscapes and urban populations that surrounded it. On March 19, 1945, Hitler published his “scorched earth” decree, in which he ordered the destruction of all that remained of Germany’s industry, transport network, and food supplies. It was never implemented, thanks partly to the intervention of Albert Speer, but it would certainly have imposed a higher level of damage on the industrial economy and infrastructure than the bombing. Hans Rumpf, chief inspector of the German fire service, later observed that the dismantling and reparation regime established by the Allies in the occupied zones of Germany after the war’s end took a much higher proportion of German industrial capacity than the fraction destroyed by bombing. Of German engineering capacity, 20  percent was destroyed from the air, 70 percent by Allied requisitioning.?2°  “Will Germany Crack?”: 1944-45  In February 1944, Heinrich Himmler, appointed minister of the interior in August 1943, in addition to his other offices, announced that “no German city will be abandoned” as a result of bombing.?2? The situation facing Germany’s urban areas in 1944 was nevertheless a daunting one. In the last seventeen months of the war three-quarters of all bombs were dropped and approximately two-thirds of all bombing deaths were caused. In Munich, 89 percent of bombs on the city fell in 1944 and 1945; in Mainz, 93 percent of the deaths from bombing occurred in the same two years.”?8 By the spring amount of equipment had been installed. German fuel supply relied in the end on being able to repair quickly enough the damage to the existing plants.24” The problems posed by trying to repair imposed because repairs could not be effected or components and parts supplied.2!° This situation was exacerbated by the decision to disperse production often long distances from the main plant.
