brewers was asked in the autumn of 1943 to supply a complete list of the water sources (springs, streams) used in brewing and mineral water production; by June 1944, 286 usable sources had been identified. The same month the Interior Ministry drew up an inventory of unused bottles that could be requisitioned to supply water, which in- cluded 357,000 beer bottles and 312,000 used for Coca-Cola.24®  Gas supply, on which a large number of German households depended, faced the same problems of random but cumulative damage to the gas network. It was found in 1943, even in heavy raids, that the loss of supply could be kept within manageable boundaries. Surplus capacity in the network actually exceeded by a significant margin the damage done by bombing. A heavy raid on Berlin on September 3-4, 1943, resulted in the loss of gas in some districts for only a few hours, in others for only a day. It was possible to find supplies from other parts of the network when local gasworks were damaged; after the raid on Leipzig on December 3-4, 1944, the main gasworks, supplying 250,000 cubic meters of gas, was temporarily put out of action, but long-distance supply managed to restore 90 percent of what was needed.2#” But the expanded raiding in 1944 resulted in widespread and unpredictable damage to both the gas and water networks. By June 1944 there were ninety-four badly damaged gasworks and waterworks countrywide; by the autumn gasworks were forced to cease operation in many places because of the loss of vital pieces of equipment that could no longer be supplied.2“8 Millions of householders found that by 1945 gas supply was nonexistent or confined to a slender stream. “The gas is running on a tiny, dying flicker,” wrote one Berlin woman in her diary in April 1945. “The potatoes have been cooking for hours. . . . 1 swallowed one half-raw.”24%  The damage done to German cities in 1944 and 1945 was extensive and indiscriminate. Goebbels ordered lists to be compiled of the destruction
