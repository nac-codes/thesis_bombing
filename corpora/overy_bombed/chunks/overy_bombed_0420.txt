Goebbels ordered lists to be compiled of the destruction of all cultural monuments and cultural treasures. Church authorities sent in regular reports of damage to ecclesiastical property.2*° Table 4.4 shows the tonnage of bombs dropped by both Allied air forces on major German cities (by comparison total tonnage on London in the Blitz was 18,800 tons, and on the second most heavily bombed urban area, Liverpool/Birkenhead, only 1,957 tons). The detailed histories of individual cities show the extent of the cumulative losses inflicted in the final raids.

This involved the loss of 10,600 residential buildings; only 2.5 percent of all buildings in the city remained completely unscathed by the bombing.

Of cultural and religious buildings, ninety-two were shelter. 1[he repair of bombD-damaged housing was governed by two decrees issued by speer as general plenipotentiary tor construction on september 15 and 16, 1945, which gave priority to getting months.?22 Local repair was allocated to a construction team organized by the Reich defense commissar, with help from mobile columns of skilled workers organized by the Reich Group Handwork. percent, a result of counting some repaired houses two, three, or more times.**1 Between January and October 1944 the number of destroyed or heavily damaged residential buildings was 311,807 against 119,668 in the first nine months of 1943, leaving 3.5 million people temporarily, or in some cases permanently, homeless.*** From the autumn of 1944 it became difficult
