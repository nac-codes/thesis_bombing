City dwellers were encouraged to move away from city centers, where the majority of deaths from fire were caused. In an ironic reversal of the RAF zoning system, Himmler ordered local authorities to move people away from the inner zone, with its narrow, tightly packed streets, to the less densely populated outer zones, the commuter suburbs, and the farthest “weekend commuter” belt; the priority was to en- sure that most evacuees stayed close to the cities they had left.2*4 In practice, restrictions were difficult to enforce and the rising tide of urban casualties accelerated the pace of both official and unofficial evacuation. Arrangements had to be made between the party regions to see how many people could be accommodated and what transport was available for them, but by September 1944 there were 5.6 million evacuees, by November 7.8 million, and by the beginning of 1945, 8.9 million. Not all of these were evacuees from bombing. Of the final figure for 1945 an estimated 1.76 million had evacuated themselves, while 2.41 million had been compulsorily evacuated or had fled from the frontier areas imminently threatened with invasion, and 841,000 had been moved with dispersed factories.** No figures are available for those who remained in the suburbs or commuter belts of damaged cities, but in Hamburg the numbers displaced from the destroyed central areas to other parts of the city numbered half a million, leading to a sudden increase in the level of population density in the unbombed zones.*** During the last half of 1944 and the first months of 1945, Germany was an exceptionally mobile society; Germans moved westward able there, for all the risks and violence of the air war. “My cellar home in Hamburg,” wrote a woman evacuated to Linz, “was a thousand times better.”?>” For those who remain
