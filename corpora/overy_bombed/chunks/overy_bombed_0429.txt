; Germans moved westward able there, for all the risks and violence of the air war. “My cellar home in Hamburg,” wrote a woman evacuated to Linz, “was a thousand times better.”?>” For those who remained in the cities, fighting the raids and their consequences was only one of the problems confronted in the last year of the war. The problems of poor health, the difficulty of obtaining rationed goods, long hours of work, and declining transport all owed something to the effects of bombing, but were also derived from the exceptional demands made in the last year of war to sustain war production and military campaigning from an exhausted people. For almost 8 million forced foreign workers and prisoners of war, and the 700,000 concentration camp prisoners, there was no choice about running the risks of being bombed or the dangers of its aftermath. German cities changed their social geography markedly over the last year of war. The population of major cities in the Ruhr-Rhineland shrank to a fraction of their total before the bomber offensive: Essen, Diisseldorf, and Frankfurt had less than half their prewar population by May 1945, but Cologne had just 20,000 left out of 770,000. The population of Munich declined by 337,000 (41 percent) between 1939 and 1945, the population of Berlin by 1.7 million (40 percent), that of Hamburg by half a million (35 percent).2°® Among those who remained were a rising proportion of non-Germans, or of German workers transferred from other industrial sites, but a shrinking number of young and middle-aged men. This was the population that suffered the high casualty rates of the last eighteen months of the war. The exact figure of deaths up to the end of the war has never been established with certainty, partly because of the sudden influx of refugees from the eastern regions in the last weeks of the conflict, partly because figures for casualties were collected by a number of different agencies—the Air Ministry, the Interior Ministry, the Econ
