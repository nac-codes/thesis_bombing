th 600 or 700 heavy bombers will eventually overwhelm the capacity of civil defense to limit casualties. This was certainly true for smaller cities hit just once, such as Pforzheim or Hildesheim, but also large cities such as Hamburg, whose defenses could not cope with the firestorm, though they could cope effectively with raids of lesser intensity. But there are other reasons for an escalating level of casualties. Shelter provision had never been ideal, but in 1943 and 1944 resources were no longer available for a  a enna ae tee A a ee ne ee ee tet ta te ae ee te 8 te et td te Lee te 2 2 ete  Page 304 of 562 53% Foreign worker Using the same proportions as November 1944, it can be estimated that of this 259,960 total, approximately 80 percent were German civilians.2© There are also archive records to show deaths from bombing in the years 1940 to 1942, a total of 11,228, of whom 6,824 died in 1942 and approximately 4,000 in 1941.2°!

There are ways to arrive at a more plausible total. If it is assumed that the figure of 271,000 dead by January 1945 isa realistic, if not precise, total (and there are archive figures that suggest a lower last months. Detailed reconstruction of deaths caused by Royal Air Force bombing from February to May 1945, though incomplete, suggests a total of at least 57,000.2% If casualties inflicted by the comprehensive shelter program. Towns in Zones II and III became victims of bombing with inadequate public shelters. The air-protection room yielded mixed results, but in areas already heavily
