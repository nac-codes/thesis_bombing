by the comprehensive shelter program. Towns in Zones II and III became victims of bombing with inadequate public shelters. The air-protection room yielded mixed results, but in areas already heavily bombed, the cellar or basement under a heavily damaged building offered much less protection than a shelter under an intact building. Medical aid, despite the exceptional efforts of the profession, was a declining resource in 1944 and 1945, increasing the risk of death from infection or loss of blood. Finally, the mobile population was more exposed to risk, particularly once Allied aircraft began routine strafing of vehicles and trains, and evacuees found themselves in areas thought to be safe from bombs but now subject to random attack. With at least 9 million people accommodated away from their homes, where they had had air-protection rooms and established self-protection routines, the risks of higher casualty levels increased. People who stayed in Berlin, despite the bombing, had established shelters to which they could go. “Finally we’re in our shelter,” wrote the Berlin diarist, “behind an iron door that weighs a hundred pounds, with rubber seals around the edges and two levers to lock it shut .. . the people here are convinced that their cave is one of the safest. There’s nothing more alien than an unknown shelter.”2®* The reaction af the nanilatian ta this wave of destruction was never unifarm Over the lact vear of war ardinary nenonle had manv different nrecsiures with which ta cane so distinonishing what was Using the same proportions as November 1944, it can be estimated that of this 259,960 total, approximately 80 percent were German civilians.2® There are also archive records to show deaths from bombing in the years 1940 to 1942, a total of 11,228, of whom 6,824 died in 1942 and approximately 4,000 in 1941.26 Based on these archive sources, the figure for those who died from May 1940 to his own calculations, particularly for those who died in 1945, Groehler
