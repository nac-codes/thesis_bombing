The peak of popular lynching occurred in March 1945, with thirty-seven killings.2”4 to German “self-justice,” echoing views expressed by Hitler as early as the autumn of 1942.275 Many of the cases of lynching were associated with party members or SA men, or policemen, who expected not to be punished. Spontaneous popular violence was rarer, though again explicable because of the level of destruction and casualties imposed in the last years of war. What is surprising is that the violence was not more widespread given the increasingly lawless character of German justice. Reports after Goebbels’s article indicated public concern that killing captured Allied aircrew would result in the killing of captured German airmen too in retaliation. The uniformed services would not endorse the killing, and Allied survivors attested to the intervention of soldiers or policemen in saving them from angry crowds. In the aftermath of heavy bombing, violent reaction against its perpetrators seems often to have taken second place to the relief at having survived and concern for others. Hans Nossack observed in Hamburg in the days after Operation Gomorrah that “no-one comforted himself with thoughts of revenge”; the enemy was at most, Nossack continued, “an instrument of unknowable forces that sought to annihilate us.”276 Somehow the German civilian population survived under the sharply deteriorating conditions of daily life, in a milieu that became progressively more abnormal.
