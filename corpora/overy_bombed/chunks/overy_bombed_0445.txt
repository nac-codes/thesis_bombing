Right to the very last days of the war, air-raid protection continued to function. The record of two of the air force Air Protection Regiments, mobile units designed to bring immediate assistance to bombed cities, even at considerable distance, illustrates the extent to which positive efforts continued to be made to combat or ameliorate the effects of remorseless daily bombing. Regiment 3, based in Berlin, in action almost every day, traveled 190 kilometers in response to the bombing of Magdeburg on August 5-6, 1944. One company tackled the damaged Krupp-Gruson plant. It succeeded in extinguishing the blazing coal bunkers, rescuing the machinery, putting out the large fires threatening the matériel stores, and saving cellars full of military supplies. A second company worked in the burning city, extinguishing 5 small fires where the bombs fell, 6 roof fires, 11 story fires, 14 “total fires” (preventing them from spreading), 6 burning provision stores, and 5 larger conflagrations.
