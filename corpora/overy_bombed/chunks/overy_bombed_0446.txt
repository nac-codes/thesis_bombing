They rescued 501 people alive, and dug out 53 dead, extinguished 127 smaller house fires and 29 “total fires,” fought 12 industrial and commercial blazes, and prevented 18 fires from spreading any farther. The narrow streets in Stettin made it difficult to get equipment into the heart of the blaze, and only after three hours was it possible to create a corridor covered with water jets to get through to the shelters. There they found 50 dead near the shelter entrance who had tried to escape through the fire by their own efforts, their corpses “completely carbonated.” In the last weeks of bombing in 1945, Regiment 7 reported a grueling schedule of operations starting with a major fire raid on Nuremberg on February 20-21, where the unit extinguished 119 small and 60 major fires, and extracted 36 bodies from the rubble, followed by summons to a further seventeen raids between February 27 and March 21.78° As the military fronts contracted, so it proved possible for technical troops from the armed forces to be deployed more extensively in trying to protect the remaining urban areas, working side by side with the surviving civil defenders.

Little effort had gone into constructing adequate public shelters, and one
