n had already experienced two American daylight raids, on October 7, 1944, and January 16, 1945, which had killed 591 people. Little effort had gone into constructing adequate public shelters, and one witness recalled that the sirens failed to sound that night. The day before the February raid was, according to Victor Klemperer, a German-Jewish philologist who had survived in Dresden married to a non-Jew, one of “perfect spring weather.”28+ By a strange historical quirk, Klemperer was among the small population of surviving Jews in Dresden who that same day had been ordered to turn up seventy-two hours later to be transported away for “outside labour duty.” When the main raid began in the middle of the night he ran at once to the Jewish shelter but scrambled on through the fires and bombs when the shelter became too hot. He managed to get down to the Elbe River, battered by the wind of the firestorm, slipping on the black rain that fell from the condensation caused by the rising column of hot air. He joined the flow of refu- gees the following morning with his wife, who had been saved onlv because someone had pulled her from the Iewish into the “Arvan” shelter below their apartments: after the loss of his house. His view was: ‘If I cannot save my home, I have nothing left in life’ So during the raid he stayed up on top so that he could throw the incendiary bombs straight onto the street.”277 Waltraud Siissmilch found herself with other classmates after each all-clear joining a long human chain passing buckets filled with water or sand by hand to the next person, or in school hours packing parcels for the bombed-out, or visiting the wounded.?”® Throughout 1944 advice on firefighting and training for self-protection continued to be published and distributed; blackout handled 63 civil defense first-aid cases, 402 civilian injuries, sent 138 off in ambulances, and recovered 38 buried bodies and 33 people still alive.2”2 Two weeks later Regiment 3 sent three companies ex
