But since Italy was regarded as politically fragile, a leaflet war was mounted to try to per- suade the population to give up the fight; a total of 4,780,500 leaflets were dropped between 1940 and 1942.12  Leaflets could easily be delivered by small numbers of aircraft operating out of RAF airbases on the island of Malta, a British colony situated only fifty-eight miles south of the coast of Sicily.

In December 1940 the RAF commander on Malta was ordered to begin a concerted propaganda campaign since leaflets were considered for the moment to be “more effective than bombs.”"!
