Italian belligerency, Barratt was instructed to begin planning the supply and RAF leadership suggested that Italy was “the heel of Achilles” in the Axis war effort, short of resources and with a population unhappy about having to fight Mussolini’s war.? Since Italy was difficult to suade the population to give up the fight; a total of 4,780,500 leaflets were dropped between 1940 and 1942.1° were considered for the moment to be “more effective than bombs.”!! One of the first leaflets drafted on Malta in November 1940 called for an Italian uprising: “On hearing the great signal all of you on block capitals) to “COUNTER-REVOLUTION.”2 Much of the leaflet campaign linked the call for Italian political resistance with the threat of bombing.

In April 1941 a new leaflet under the headline “ROME IS IN DANGER’ threatened to bomb the Italian capital if Mussolini ordered the bombing of Athens or Cairo.12 By this time a handful of Italian fighter and bomber aircraft had taken a brief and inglorious part in the late stages of the Bat- tle of Britain, and British leaflets promised the Italian population that Mussolini would be paid back in kind for helping Hitler. Nothing in the end came of the political initiative, and the bombing was in reality small-scale and intermittent, a “small switch,” as Charles Portal put it, rather than “a big stick.”!* Throughout 1940 and 1941 there were twenty-four small raids by Bomber Command (only four of them in 1941) and ninety-five raids from Malta, most of them by handfuls of Wellington bombers, seldom more than ten at a time, on their way to bases in the Middle East.1* In November 1940, for example, six Wellingtons attacked Naples, where they reported a poor blackout, no searchlights or enemy aircraft, and inaccurate antiaircraft fire.
