After three years of war the chief of the air staff, Rino Fougier, was forced to admit that Italy was “in practice without effective defence.”2> Most fighter aircraft had been used in support of the ground armies in Greece and North Africa, while a night-fighter capability scarcely existed despite the fact that most raids until 1943 were by night. By September 1942, Italian night fighters had flown only 380 hours on operations, compared with 158,100 hours for day fighters.?° Searchlights, antiaircraft batteries, and radar were available in limited quantities, but were not integrated into a national system of communication to cope with identifying and challenging incoming aircraft (even the daylight raid on Milan had prompted the air-raid alarm only after the bombs were already falling).

The blackout was poor in all areas and trains could be seen running between towns fully lit.14° There were points in 1941 at which intensified bombing of Italy was considered, suggested that at the r
