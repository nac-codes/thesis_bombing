hurches and buildings. Around 100 depositories were established in Italy and hundreds of monuments given minimum protection, enough to cope with shrapnel or a distant blast, but not enough for a direct hit.*® All of this changed with the start of the Allied offensive in the autumn of 1942. The poor level of preparation for attacks on this scale helps to explain their substantial material and psychological impact compared with raiding on Germany. The bombing of Turin, particularly the heavy raids of November 20-21 and 28-29 by aircraft of Bomber Command, which hit both the industrial zone and the city center, resulted in extensive and random destruction. Over 100 firms indicated some damage, but in important cases the loss was almost total. A radar workshop was “entirely destroyed” along with 90 percent of its machinery; a firm producing magnetos for aero-engines was almost completely eliminated by just one bomb; a major aircraft repair factory, Aeronautica d'Italia, was burnt out, leaving only one production line still operating. A report on the raids on Genoa on November 13-14 and 15-16 listed damage to rails, electric power lines, and tunnels, much of which could be repaired, but at the Marconi radio works, production was “completely paralyzed” and had to be transferred to a nearby town.” The threat to Italian production, already suffering from severe shortages  af materiale and aauinmant wacimmeadiata The War Minietry an Nawamher 16 circulated ta all minictriac a warning that war induetry waild naw hawa ta he darentralized and dicnarcad ta araac ULE PLELECls LACLIEL Lilall LIE LOCA) COIMMMAIUELS OL ILaAly © Tilliilal yy ZULIES 11a LO OLEAIMAS LIE PIOLE CUO OL LIE POPULALIOL ULE ULIE AViETIStL YY OF LIE ILELIOL, VUE LISLLUCLIOIS COMLIMIUEU LO VE Seri 1LOrl the Interior Ministry in Rome that the raids and alerts (three raids and seventeen aircraft) “have caused great delay to the trains.”*° It was immediately realized that alerts had the effect of halting minimum p
