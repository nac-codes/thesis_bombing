forces were disarmed, interned, and in most cases sent north to Greater Germany as forced labor. Italy became an occupied country, like France, with the difference that in this case a new Mussolini regime, the Italian Social Republic (usually known as the Sald Republic after the town on Lake Garda) was set up following Mussolini’s dramatic rescue by German special forces from imprisonment. It was in effect a puppet government, entirely subservient to the military requirements of the German commander in chief south, Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, but a number of Italian airmen and soldiers remained loyal to Fascism and served alongside German forces. German leaders were not so much concerned with re-creating the Fascist state as they were with preventing the Allies from reaching central Europe, but for the Italian people Fascist government remained in place, widely un- popular and despised, until Mussolini’s death at the hands of Italian partisans in late April 1945.  For the Allies, Italy presented both problems and opportunities. The priority from September 1943, after the conquest of Sicily and the first tentative landings on the toe of the peninsula, was to defeat the German armed forces and, if that could be done quickly, to liberate Italy and prepare to assault the German empire from the south. If it could not be done easily, as soon appeared the case,  the conviction of the uselessness of past and present efforts is almost general.” Iris Origo, listening to discussions going on around her in Tuscany, complained that it was all “talk, talk, talk, and no action,” reflecting a “dumb, fatalistic apathy” among a people no longer willing to go on with the war, but unable to find a means to end it.*4 Ordinary Italians turned to religion or superstition to help Marshal Arthur Tedder, commander of the Mediterranean Air Force, to start bombing Naples and Rome again in order to pressure the Badoglio government to seek “peace terms.”®?
