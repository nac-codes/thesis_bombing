American intelligence reports suggested widespread rioting and anti-Fascist demonstrations once the bombing had restarted.2° On September 3, Badoglio bowed to reality, despite the looming missions to Austria, southern Germany, and the Balkans, as well as against Italian targets. The RAF strategic force, composed mainly of medium Wellington bombers, was based at Brindisi.*” A clear distinction between strategic and tactical bombing was difficult to make, since there were occasions when strategic forces were needed to support the ground war or to destroy commu- nications far in the rear of German armies, while for the rest of the time they were expected to raid German targets. In December 1943, for example, out of a list of forty-eight strategic targets for Operation Pointblank supplied by the American Economic Warfare Division, only seven were in Italy, and only two (both ball-bearing factories) were included on the list of priorities.2® In November 1943 the operations director at MAAF, Brigadier General Lauris Norstad, ordered the tactical air forces to concentrate on supporting the ground war and bombing communications targets up to a line from Civitavecchia (near Rome) to Ancona on the east coast; the strategic air forces, by this time principally the Fifteenth Air Force, were to bomb all communications targets north of this line, using either Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers or their B-17s and B-24s when necessary.*? The line shifted with the fortunes of the ground battle, but not until March 1, 1945, did the tactical air forces assume responsibilitv for the whole area of northern Italv still under German occupation.1™ The difference between a tactical and a strategic raid often made little difference to the population around  Page 338 of 562 58% — —— a” st SS —— missions to Austria, southern Germany, and the Balkans, as well as against Italian targe
