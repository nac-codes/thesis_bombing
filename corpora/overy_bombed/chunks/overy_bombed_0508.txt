in the spring of 1945 there were over 1,900 American heavy bombers based in the Mediterranean out of an overall total of almost 4,300 American combat aircraft. Heavy bombers flew a total of 18,518 sorties in 1943, 90,383 in 1944, though some of their bomb load was directed at German or Balkan targets. From 1943 to the end of the war, American heavy bombers stationed in the Mediterranean dropped 112,000 tons on Italian targets and 143,000 tons on Greater Germany and German-occupied central Europe; tactical bombers dropped a further 163,000 tons on Italian targets, a grand total by Allied air forces on Italy of 276,312 tons.2% For the bomber crews flying in Italy the dangers were considerably less than in Germany, though the weather remained a persistent hazard despite the claim made by Harris that bombing could be conducted on all but 8 percent of days in the Mediterranean in January and 5 percent in July (compared with 51 percent and 21 percent lost days flying from English bases).1™ In late 1942 the Italian Riv Darna had anes fart fair cariinaahla nicht fichtare maoct af tham hinlanae inneanahla af 0 titra intartrantian 104 Tha annacitian fram Italian antiaivaraft and fichtare dicannaarad in artiumn 1042 Page 340 of Of the 381 raids by the RAF Med., 135 were small raids mounted from Maltese bases.
