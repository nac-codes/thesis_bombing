In April a second campaign the loss of only 108 bombers, a rate of only 0.4 percent of all sorties. Of this total tonnage, three-quarters fell on transport targets.12° The outcome was again mixed. The destruction of bridges and concluded. Nor did they cause “complete internal economic collapse.”144 Kesselring, when interviewed in August 1945 after the end of the war, confirmed that the transport plan had not been a great and machinery and once it had begun, the major industrial regions again became targets for the Allied strategic air forces. Heavy raids were made in the spring and summer of 1944, hitting a total of 420 plants, particularly in the armaments, engineering, and steel sectors, and Italian oil depots at Trieste, Fiume, and Marghera.1** Extensive damage was done to industrial buildings, but a regular toll of Italian civilian lives was exacted with each raid, including deaths from low-level strafing of workers. One of the worst was the raid on Milan on October 20, 1944, which resulted in some of the aircraft dropping their bombs in error on residential districts, killing 614 people, including 184 pupils and 19 teachers at the Francesco Crispi school, more than three times the number killed in all the other seventeen raids on the city in the course of the year.13® The renewal of bombing prompted the German authorities to continue the program of dispersal that had begun in haste in the winter of 1942-43 and been suspended with the armistice.
