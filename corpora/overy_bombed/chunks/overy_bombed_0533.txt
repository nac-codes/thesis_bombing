in the daily lives of many ordinary Italians confronted with the continuous hardships imposed by bombing. More important in terms of survival was the expansion of civil defense facilities and the widespread flight from the cities. For those who remained in urban areas, air-raid alerts became an almost daily occurrence. In Bologna province, for example, there were ninety-four air raids from July 1943 to April 1945, which killed an estimated 2,481 people, injured another 2,000, and destroyed 13 percent of Bologna’s buildings. In 1942 there was one alert lasting 1 hour 29 minutes; in 1943 the alerts lasted for 115 hours, in 1944 for 285 hours, and in 1945, 77 hours.1*4 In Bologna, as in many other cities, the provision of shelter spaces had expanded rapidly with the onset of regular bombing. In October 1943 there had been spaces for 26,000 people out of a population of more than 600,000; by the spring of 1945 it was estimated that the 84 bombproof shelters, 15 trenches, and 25 tunnels could accommodate 100,000.1*2 In Milan, where trenches, school shelters, and public shelters could hold 177,000 by October 1942, plans were begun to build a further 179 shelters to house another 38,000 people, while 8,000 domestic shelters were in the process of being overhauled to meet shelter  Page 351 of 562 60% 1945 to one-half the level of 1938.14° This mainly affected not the German occupiers but a large part of the Italian civil population, which endured widespread losses of housing and possessions, un- ian damage and military results. The Italians, D'Arcy Osborne continued, were beginning to think that German occupation was a lesser evil “than Anglo-Saxon liberation.”!4* Eden was sufficiently ened, by bombing and who were likely to harbor “bitter memories of our method of liberation.”*“? The first priority for both Allies was nevertheless to defeat Germany rather than inhibit military to conduct their campaign; the vice chief of the air staff, Air Marshal Sir Douglas Evill, told C
