In the war of words and bombs, Douhet, Italy’s great theorist of unrestricted strategic bombing, came home to roost. In early 1944 the U.S. Eighth Air Force published a widely circulated publicity booklet, Target: Germany. It purported to tell the story of the first year of the American bombing of the German enemy, “raining havoc and destruction on the Nazi war machine.” The inside covers show a map of Europe where the force’s bombs had fallen: there are nineteen German targets but forty-five in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. For much of the first year the apprentice American force took the short route across the Channel to bombard military-economic installations working for the German war effort. Most of the photographs in the richly illustrated text are of raids made on France and the Low Countries. The first raid on German territory finally took place late in January 1943, but more accessible European objectives were still seen as a useful way to get the crews to cut their teeth on combat.  The bombing of European targets outside Germany and Italy was in reality more complex than this and was large in scale. The occupied territories of western and northern Europe—France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark—absorbed almost 30 percent of the bomb tonnage dropped by the American and British bomber forces. The occupied or satellite countries in eastern Europe and the Balkans absorbed another 6.7 percent.” Well over one-third of all Allied bombs dropped on Europe fell on the German New Order, making the experience of bombing in the Second World War a European-wide one. The purpose behind these bombings, and their consequences for the populations caught in the coils of German expansion, are seldom treated as systematically as accounts of the  Allied propaganda sought to convey.
