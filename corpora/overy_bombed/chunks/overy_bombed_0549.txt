rman victories between 1939 and spring 1941 brought most of continental Europe under German control. Neutral states were compelled to work with the changed balance of power, while those states that were allied with Germany—Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Croatia, Bulgaria—were satellites of the powerful German core. In Berlin the sudden transformation in German fortunes brought a flood of plans and projects for a European New Order that would secure Germany’s permanent political and economic hegemony. The conquered states became involuntary participants in this larger project, compelled to provide economic resources, finance, and labor for the German war effort, and doomed to be the battlefields on which the enlarged German empire would defend its borders. Right to the end of the war there were still German forces fighting in the Netherlands, Italy, Hungary, and the Czech lands, alongside the defense of the German homeland. It was inevitable under these circumstances that Britain, and later the United States, would have to engage the enemy on the territory of occupied or satellite states where German forces were dispersed. Until the Western states were in a position to mount a major land invasion, airpower was regarded as the principal means available to attack Axis military resources across Europe and to undermine the extended war economy established throughout the German New Order. Because of the problem of aircraft range and the danger of flying for long periods over heavily defended territory, it was only possible in the first years of war to attack targets in western and northern Europe. Eastern and southeastern Europe were only struck regularly from late 1943 onward, chiefly by the American Fifteenth Air Force based in southern Italy. An alternative was to rely on local resistance and sabotage, and throughout the period in which air forces bombed targets in New Order Europe, the Allies tried to encourage the occupied peoples to take a hand in their own liberation
