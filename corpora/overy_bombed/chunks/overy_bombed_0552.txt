They were carried out not only by Bomber Command but also by Coastal Command aircraft; in 1941, once the invasion threat had receded, Fighter Command also attacked coastal targets in large-scale fighter sweeps—the so-called Circus operations—planned to lure the German Air Force into combat and undermine air force organization.
