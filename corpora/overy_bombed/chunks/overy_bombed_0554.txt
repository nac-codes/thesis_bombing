cording to French records of 210 raids in 1940 and 439 in 1941 in which 1,650 people were killed and 2,311 injured.1* In May 1941 the mayors of the coastal towns of Dieppe, Brest, Lorient, and Bordeaux protested through the U.S. legation at Vichy about heavy bombing of residential areas. The British foreign secretary, Anthony Eden, asked the Air Ministry to take every care to minimize damage to civilian property and civilian casualties, but the raids continued nonetheless. Intelligence information suggested that the French population still believed that the RAF bombed only the military targets, while it was the Germans who bombed residential districts to try to stoke up popular hatred of the British.12 In August the Vichy regime made a formal diplomatic protest to the British government via the British embassy in Madrid about the inaccuracy of British bombing, followed by further representations in September about the continual bombing of the Channel port of Le Havre, where it was claimed that British aircraft had attacked the town fifty-five times in a year (it was indeed a regular RAF target), scattering bombs all over the residential quarters and killing 205 people.

The Bomber Directorate suspected that the protests were part of an orchestrated German plot to compel the RAF to reduce their offensive against French targets.1° A number of factors explain the escalating scale and lethality of bomber attacks on non-German targets from late 1941 onward.
