ffensive against French targets.1° A number of factors explain the escalating scale and lethality of bomber attacks on non-German targets from late 1941 onward. The military situation brought increasing pressure to bomb targets in occupied Europe that served the German submarine and air blockade. The prime targets were to be found in the ports of western France and the airfields and bases across the Channel in northern France and the Low Countries. It was also soon evident that armaments, aviation, and shipbuilding firms in the occupied zones were being utilized by the Germans, either directly taken over or the result of a collaborative agreement.!® The Ministry of Economic Warfare considered these to be necessary targets for air attack, not only because they were more accessible than most targets in Germany, but because their destruction might reduce the willingness of occupied populations to work for the extended German war effort. On June 23, 1941, the War Cabinet approved the bombing of factories throughout occupied France, but only by daylight, to ensure a better level of accuracy, though the RAF still held back on political grounds from bombing targets far inland, including Paris. Small raids on German shipping at Brest had begun in January 1941, but the first heavy raids against Brest and Lorient, including in this case night attacks, started later in the spring, though these too remained intermittent and ineffective until the War Cabinet recommended a sustained campaign in October 1941 to reduce the dangerous threat to the Atlantic sea lanes, which it failed to do.1” At the same cahinet meeting Churchill acreed ta attacks an sands trains in narthern France which were asaimed tn he earrving cunnilies ar ammunitian far German farees Sten hw sten the military imnera-  Page 362 of 562 62% i i.e milez zone: nine e oil installations, eight chemical plants, eleven aircraft works, seven n blast furnaces/steel mills, eleven shipbuilding firms, and another dozen small
