t 1943, and although Harris by now no longer wanted operational distractions from his attacks on Germany, his desire for “real blitzes” on the French ports could now be fulfilled.4* Harris described the French interlude in his memoirs as “one of the most infuriating episodes” in the whole bomber offensive and an evident “misuse of air power.”4? He blamed the Admiralty for the change in priority, bombing civilians for the sake of the survival of British sea traffic. There had already been more than twenty attacks on the ports since 1940, which had served to encourage the Germans to take every precaution to protect submarine operations.** In the summer of 1942 a British propaganda campaign had been launched from the air against coastal towns from Dunkirk to St.-Nazaire warning the populations to evacuate: “we must carry on a war to the death [guerre @ l’outrance] against the submarines.”“* Most evacuations did not occur until the bombing started in earnest.

On one raid the bombers carried 1,000 tons of bombs, the same quantity dropped a few months before by the German Air Force in the major raid on the city of Stalingrad.° The French report following the bombing described the raids as an example of a new RAF strategy of “scorched earth”; not a building in the town remained standing or unscathed, a “dead city,” except for the submarine pens undamaged by the rain of bombs. Ina thirty-kilometer radius from the town thousands of village buildings had been destroyed and farms incinerated.“” The PWE published an uncompromising statement following the bombing that the innocent must inevitably suffer with the guilty: “The violence and frequency of attacks involving hardship to civilians must increase.”4® Naval Intelligence assessments were neverth
