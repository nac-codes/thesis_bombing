.A.F.!” but also “A bas l’Américain Air Force.”=> privations, all its separations, unnerved by too prolonged a wait for its liberation.”®1 The French Air Force, reduced under the armistice terms with Germany to a skeleton organization, tried to assess practice in order to understand the techniques and tactics involved as well as the effects of bombs on urban society, industrial architecture, and popular morale.®? Many of the reports on individual of St.-Etienne, “have no relation to the means employed, and this bombardment represents, like all the others, a waste of matériel—without counting the unnecessary losses in human life that they provoke.”* The air force worked out the pattern of bombing accuracy to show just how wide the dispersion of effort was. In raids against Lille, the area in which bombs fell was a rectangle 8 by 4 kilometers; against Rouen, 8 by 3 kilometers; a raid on the railway station at Cambrai in 1944 covered an area 3 kilometers in length and 1.5 kilometers wide. The impact varied from raid to raid, but studies showed that many raids covered an area of between 200 and 400 hectares (500 to 1,200 acres), which explained the escalating losses of life and property. The French Air Force was impressed most by low-level dive-bombing and rocket attacks using the American P-47 Thunderbolt and the Hawker 1-B Typhoon, which achieved their object with much greater operational economy, and matched French strategic preferences before 1939.°° The French government and population were not unprepared for a bombing war. As in Britain, the French state had begun to plan for passive defense against air attack as early as 1923; a law for compulsory passive defense organization was passed in April 1935, compelling local authorities to begin the organization of civil defense measures. In July 1938 a director of passive defense was appointed in the Defense Ministry to coordinate the protection of civilian lives and property with the committees of passive defense set
