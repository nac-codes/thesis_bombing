The Vichy regime was asked to establish a Secretariat for Air Defense, including a national director for “passive defense,” and it was the German intention that the French organization would eventually operate over the whole of France.”4 The new French defenses included antiaircraft batteries that were, unlike their German counterparts, controlled by the army.
