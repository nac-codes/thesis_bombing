A new air-raid to the main air defense centers to help coordinate air defense measures across the whole country.”* The system suffered from the same problems found in the northern zone, since alerts could only be authorized by the Germans on information passed to them by French observers, except in more remote areas where there were no German officials.” The result once again was that alerts were some- policies necessary to maintain economic and social survival in the bombed cities.”8 The Passive Defense Directorate, a branch of the new department of Aerial Defense, held an awkward constitutional position between the German authorities on the one hand and the French SIPEG on the other. One of the things the new organization had to provide was mobile support units to cope particularly with the threat of firebombing on the model already adopted in northern France. Emergency fire and rescue battalions were set up at Avignon, Lyon, Aix-en-Provence, and Montpellier, to be summoned with German approval to any raid where local civil defense could not cope.” But they remained short of personnel—there were only 1,500 to cover the whole of southern France—and short of essential equipment because it was being supplied by French factories to meet German orders. When units were sent to help with raids in northern France, the shortages of manpower and equipment were evident, while the population in the south complained that they were not left with adequate protection.®° In general, French cities were much less well protected than British or German cities, while the tension between the French organization and the German authorities, whose principal interest was in safeguarding German military installations and industries working to German orders, left ci- vilian communities potentially more vulnerable to the effects of inaccurate raiding.
