l interest was in safeguarding German military installations and industries working to German orders, left ci- vilian communities potentially more vulnerable to the effects of inaccurate raiding.  In many cases, however, the German air defense forces cooperated with French civil defense and emergency services. At Lorient the German Air Protection Regiment 34, stationed in northwest France, was called in during January 1943 to try to stem the fires not only in the port area where German personnel were stationed, but also in the residential areas hit by the rain of incendiaries. The local civil defense also summoned help from seven fire services in other towns. The failure to save Lorient resulted not from the lack of effort on the part of both French and German emergency workers, but from the sheer weight of the attack.®! In Nantes, later in the year, the two forces, French and German, also cooperated in fighting the effects of the raid not only on the port, which the Germans needed, but also on the streets of the town itself.8* Again it was the scale of the bombing that made it difficult for civil defense to cope with the immediate crisis, but by the day following the heaviest raid, September 17, 1943, there were 800 French and German workers, helped by local miners and teams from the National Youth movement, opening roads, making damaged housing safe, and searching for buried survivors. Eventually 1,500 emergency workers and volunteers worked to restore some kind of order. They were hampered first by the lack of equipment—there were only four mechanical shovels and just fifty trucks—and then by the attacks that followed on September 23. On the following day only 400 men remained to tackle the rescue work, since many workers had fled with their families from the ruined housing. Eventually twice this number could be found, but the French authorities observed that many were German workers, who displayed a greater discipline be- cause they had no personal ties to the c
