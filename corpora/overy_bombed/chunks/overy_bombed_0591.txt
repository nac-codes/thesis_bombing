In December 1941 a scheme was established between the bombed city of Brest and the southern city of Lyon in which the bombed-out (sinistrés) were to be housed in Lyon and given welfare and funds by the council and population that adopted them. The scheme failed to attract even 100 children, since parents were reluctant to accept separation and the children were reluctant to go.®” In 1942 other bombed towns either sought or were offered adoption by cities regarded as safe, including Le Havre, which was eventually adopted by Algiers, but much of the aid came in the form of money or clothes or books for the homeless rather than a new home. Most French evacuees moved to family or friends in nearby villages, and French planners insisted, against German objections, that on practical and political grounds it made more sense to house evacuees locally rather than in remote areas in central France. With the heavy bombing of Lorient, St.-Nazaire, and Brest in early 1943, the population flowed out into the surrounding countryside in tens of thousands.®* On February 4, 1944, Laval issued comprehensive guidelines on evacuation policy following the severe bombing of the winter and the expectation that the military threat would escalate. The guiding principles of the program were the need for an ordered transfer of population and the consent of those to be transferred, “voluntary but organized.” The government favored persuasion using a program of posters, radio broadcasts, and public meetings.
