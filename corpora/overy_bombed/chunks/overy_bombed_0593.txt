The French population faced an inescapable dilemma that made it difficult to know how to respond to the raids: they wanted the Allies who were bombing them to win, and they wanted the Germans who protected them to lose. Since they were not themselves at war, the sense that they represented a national “front line” against a barbarous enemy could not as easily be used to mobilize the population as it could in Britain and Germany.
