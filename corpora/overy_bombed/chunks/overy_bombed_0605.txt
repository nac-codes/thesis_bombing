Bombers used for ground support would, he argued, “be entirely ineffective,” leading “directly to disaster” for the invasion force.™4 Spaatz objected to Eisenhower that support for invasion was “an uneconomical use” of the heavy bomber force and preferred to leave the operations to the large tactical air forces assigned to the Allied Expeditionary Air Force under Air Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory, whose fighter-bomber and light bomber aircraft were intended to attack small targets and could react quickly and flexibly to battlefield requirements.1!* Both bomber forces wished to be able to concentrate on Pointblank operations against Germany as a more strategically valuable way to limit the German response to invasion. Arnold told Spaatz in late April 1944, after the decision had already been taken to focus on the French railway system, that Pointblank should “still be pressed to the limit.”“ The arguments put forward in favor of the Transportation Plan by Tedder and his scientific adviser, Solly Zuckerman, have already been discussed. Zuckerman’s paper produced in January 1944 on “Delay and Disorganisation of Enemy Movement by Rail” formed the basis of the eventual preinvasion plan. On March 25 ina long and hotly debated meeting, Eisenhower finally came down in favor of using the bomber forces, under his own direct command, to attack the French railway system and other strategic targets both before and during the invasion period.11” This decision still left unresolved the political anxieties about possible levels of casualty.
