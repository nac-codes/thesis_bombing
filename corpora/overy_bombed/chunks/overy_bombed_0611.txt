the raid on Lille on April 10 hit an area of thirty-two square kilometers; that on Noisy-le-Sec on April 18 covered thirty square kilometers; on Rouen a day later, the area was twenty-four square kilometers.125 In May the French authorities counted a total of 1,284 raids in which bombs fell on 793 different localities, 630 of them along the northern coast and the area north- east of Paris. Only 8 percent of the attacks were undertaken at night, which ought to have increased the possibility of more accurate raiding, but many of the daylight raids were carried out at heights of 3,000-4,000 meters (10,000-13,000 feet). In some cases, high casualties resulted from what the Passive Defense Directorate called “imprudence”—people standing at their windows to watch the bombing, others out in the street, or in their gardens. In a raid on Nice on May 26, 438 people were killed, two-thirds of them on the street, one-third in their houses. The shelters, for the most part either trenches or converted cellars, had uneven fortunes during the raiding; some stood up well even to direct hits, others, like one at Rouen on May 30, were blown apart, and most of the occupants killed 42° Some of the heaviest losses of life occurred in targets in the former unoccupied zone, which were hit by American aircraft of the Fifteenth Air Force operating from bases in Italy. For the crews in- volved, the bombing of precise railway targets with a view to reducing damage to civilian lives and property was very different from the long-range raids against Pointblank targets in southern Ger- many, which had been the main activity of the force since its formation in November 1943. Two raids, one on St.-Etienne on May 26, 1944, and one on Marseille the following day, resulted in heavy loss of civilian life. At St.-Etienne the alert sounded in good time; the 150 B-17s attacked in waves from around 13,000 feet, and half the bombs fell in the zone around the rail links. But there were too few proper shelter
