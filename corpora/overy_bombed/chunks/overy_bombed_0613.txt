The attack on the rail center at St.-Pierre-des-Corps on April 11 struck killed.126 scattered bombs over ten of the city’s quarters, destroying 500 buildings and killing 1,752 people. Again Passive Defense observed the “insouciance” of a population hit by an air raid for the first time and the absence of effective civil defense training. The stations were unimportant (one was a railway cul-de-sac), but the effect of the raid was to create a crisis of public morale and strong hostility to the air forces that carried out the attack.12” The scale of the raiding and the damage inflicted brought protests from the French Resistance and the French authorities in London. The French Commis- sariat for Foreign Affairs warned the Foreign Office in early May that the raids were having a damaging effect on French opinion; in early June a resolution from the Resistance Group Assembly was passed on by Massigli, calling on the bomber forces to change their tactics and for an active propaganda campaign “to dissipate the growing ill-feeling” among the victim populations.12® An OSS report from Madrid relayed the Resistance view that the French population now believed its situation to be no better than that of “the Nazis in Germany.”!?° This knowledge made little difference to Allied operations. In June, however, the bombing reached its high point as Allied forces poured ashore on D-Day and spread out into the Normandy countryside.  The results of the Transportation Plan were the subject of keen argument both at the time and since. French investigations showed that by the beginning of June rail traffic was down to around half the level in January 1944, and in the key regions of the north and west, down to 15 and 10 percent. There were 2,234 cases of damage to rail lines between January and June 1944, but as in Britain or Germany or the Soviet Union, these were relatively easy to repair.42° Much damage was also done by sabotage, which the Resistance thoug
