o rail lines between January and June 1944, but as in Britain or Germany or the Soviet Union, these were relatively easy to repair.42Â° Much damage was also done by sabotage, which the Resistance thought was a more effective way of achieving the same end, and with fewer losses to the French population, particularly the railwaymen, who were regarded as key Resistance workers.121 Between January and July, bombing and strafing destroyed or severely dam- aged 2,536 French locomotives, sabotage a further 1,605. But according to the SNCF (the French national railway), sabotage accounted for 70,000 goods wagons compared with 55,000 from air at- tack. 132 Tn the three months from April to June there were 1,020 bomb attacks on the rail network, but 1,713 acts of sabotage. 133 Of these the two most significant causes of delay to traffic were the eee eee eee eee eee eee oe eee eee ee ee nee ne ee ee eee ene eee we ne ee eee ee eee eee ee eee ee ene eee en nem eee nee ne ene ee ee FN NN ON A END Ne BONE NN NN NE ENA MRE Neh Re BENING NAR Nh BN DAN EEE SD available evidence suggested that casualties had been approximately 50 percent lower than anticipated.12+ Only after Roosevelt had insisted that there should be no restriction on military action if Operation Overlord were to succeed did Churchill finally on May 11 give his full approval to the campaign.1? For the four weeks before D-Day a furious crescendo of bombing descended on the French from April to June.1** Some attacks achieved a high level of precision, but in many cases bombs were scattered over a wide area. The attack on the rail center at St.-Pierre-des-Corps on April 11 struck twenty-four square kilometers.124 In May the French authorities counted a total of 1,284 raids in which bombs fell on 793 different localities, 630 of them along the northern coast and the area north- the air forces that carried out the attack.122 The scale of the raiding and the damage inflicted brought protests from the French Resistance and
