The French Commis- passed on by Massigli, calling on the bomber forces to change their tactics and for an active propaganda campaign “to dissipate the growing ill-feeling” among the victim populations.“ An OSS report from Madrid relayed the Resistance view that the French population now believed its situation to be no better than that of “the Nazis in Germany.”!22 This knowledge made little difference to Allied with fewer losses to the French population, particularly the railwaymen, who were regarded as key Resistance workers.124 Between January and July, bombing and strafing destroyed or severely dam- tack.122 In the three months from April to June there were 1,020 bomb attacks on the rail network, but 1,713 acts of sabotage.122 Of these the two most significant causes of delay to traffic were the attacks on repair depots, which created a cumulative backlog of repair to the rolling stock hit by raids or sabotage, and the attacks on rail bridges. Many of these were carried out by the tactical air forces using fighter-bombers and light bombers, and they proved decisive in cutting the key regions off from rapid German reinforcement. Most rail centers could be made operable again in an average of seven days, but bridges took from ten to sixteen days./24 The German authorities made strenuous efforts to keep the rail system going and succeeded for much of the period of the transport campaign. By suspending almost all civilian traffic and helped by persistent poor weather for bombing, it proved possible to maintain military through traffic up to June (when 535 loaded troop trains could still be deployed), but a slow decline set in from July. Total German ton-kilometers were 300 million for the month to mid-March, 400 million for each of the n
