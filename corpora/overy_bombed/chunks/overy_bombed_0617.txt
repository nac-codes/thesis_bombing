days.124 The German authorities made strenuous efforts to keep the rail system going and succeeded for much of the period of the transport campaign. by which time the loss of rail traffic compromised the further possibility of effective German defense.42> The argument from the French viewpoint, however, was not whether German fighting power suitable means to achieve the aim of precise destruction and limited French losses. This conclusion was even more evident in the efforts of the two bomber forces to destroy the sites from which V-weapons were to be fired rather than raid the factories where they were being made. The first raids against the construction sites and depots in France were made in November 1943 after the Central Interpretation Unit at Medmenham had identified the first V-1 bunkers. The campaign against the V-weapons was code-named Crossbow, but the bombing operations were known as Noball. The quantities of bomb tonnage dropped during the course of the campaign, from early Decem- ber 1943 to mid-September 1944, exceeded by a wide margin the total devoted to the Transportation Plan, a final tally of 118,000 tons of bombs, 86,000 of which were dropped between June 12 and September 12, 1944, on targets considerably smaller than the marshaling yards and viaducts targeted for D-Day. The first bombings in the winter of 1943-44 were thought to have set back the onset of the V-weapons campaign by six months, but after the first attacks the Germans abandoned the system of “ski-jump” launch sites (so called after their shape) because of their visibility and vulner- ability, but let the impression remain that work was still being done on them in order to attract the bombers.12° Eventually most of the original sites were identified and destroyed, but the newly modified launch sites were hard to find or hit. The German campaign was held up chiefly because of technical problems in producing sufficient operational V-1s to be able to start the offensive sooner.12” Afte
