be given to the Allied armies in France against targets that were almost immune to bomb attack. In April 1944, RE8 had explained to the Air Ministry that small sites protected by twenty feet of concrete had a low level of vulnerability.12° In July, Sinclair instructed Portal to give the Crossbow sites a lower priority because “they are hard to destroy and easy to repair.” When Eighth Air Force B-17s attacked ten sites in July, they missed eight and dropped only four bombs on the remaining two.*“° Although Churchill had been keen for Bomber Command to try to blunt the V-weapon assault, the Air Ministry recognized by July that any effects were likely to be ephemeral. An Air Intelligence report in July on the V-1 sites captured by the American army in Cherbourg showed that although they had been heavily bombed, the design of the sites made them almost impervious to bomb damage and easily repaired if a chance hit achieved anything.1*! The bombing continued until September, when most of the sites were captured by the advancing army, but both air forces recognized the limitation of using heavy bombers for what were in effect tactical targets.  The same limitations operated with the decision to use heavy bombers in support of Eisenhower’s ground campaign in France. For almost three months, northern France was a battlefield. As in the German attack on France in 1940 or the Soviet Union in 1941, it proved very difficult for the advancing Allied armies and air forces to avoid heavy damage to the towns, cities, and civilians in their path. In northern Normandy, where the battle lasted longest and was at its most intense, 14,000 French civilians died, 57 percent as a result of bombing. Heavy air raids began from the first morning, June 6, after warning leaflets had been dropped at dawn encouraging the Normandy population to “Leave for the Fields! You Haven't a Minute to Lose!” In Caen on June 6 around 600 were killed by an eee eee een ee ee eg eee ene eee eee ieee eee eee ee e
