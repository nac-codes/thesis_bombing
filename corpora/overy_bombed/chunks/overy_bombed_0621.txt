merican air raid, another 200 the following day amid the ruins of much of the city; on June 7 a raid by more than 1,000 Bomber Command aircraft against six small towns, including Vire, St.-L6, Lisieux, and Coutances, eradicated the urban areas almost entirely. In the first two days of the campaign, 3,000 French civilians were killed“? The village of Aunay-sur-Odon, bombed to stop the move- ment of German tanks a few days later, was literally erased from the map. Pictures taken after the raid showed a single church spire in an otherwise entirely level landscape. The French authorities counted 2,307 bombardments in June, 1,016 of them on the north coast provinces, most against railway targets. In July there were fewer raids, 1,195 in total, in August 1,121.44? The great majority of the raids were tactical, carried out by the Allied Expeditionary Air Force, but on occasion the heavy bombers were asked to bring overwhelming firepower to bear. Two attacks on Caen, one on July 7 and a second on July 18, were among the heaviest of the Overlord campaign. The raid on July 7 involved 467 bombers dropping 2,276 tons on the northern outskirts of the town. There were few Ger- man defenders and the main effect of the raid, which left a moonscape on the approaches to Caen, was to force the British and Canadian troops to clear the roads before any further advance could be made.1“4 The raid on July 18 by 942 bombers dropped an extraordinary 6,800 tons on the city and its eastern environs; the result did little to the German defenders, who had largely withdrawn toa defensive line south of Caen, nor to the population, 12,000 of whom eked out a precarious existence in caves outside the town at Fleury, but the raid once again left a ruined landscape that slowed down the advance of ground forces. By the end of the invasion a combination of bombing and shelling had left habitable housing for only 8,000 out of the 60,000 people who had lived there.1*2 Page 392 of 562 67% by which time the
