was strategically important as a potential port for Allied supply as Eisenhower’s armies moved rapidly eastward toward Germany, but it was defended by a garrison of over 11,000 German troops commanded by Colonel Eberhard Wildermuth. Since Le Havre was heavily fortified and he was under orders to prevent the port falling to the enemy for as long as possible, he rejected a request to surrender on September 3. Bomber Command was then ordered to bombard the city for a week before a ground assault could finally seize the port. A remarkable 9,631 tons of bombs were dropped and 82 percent of the town was destroyed at a cost of at least 1,536 civilian deaths. The German command refused to give up and a brief ground assault soon captured the port and the entire garrison. The post-raid analysis carried out by SHAEF concluded that the bombing had not done much to assist the eventual ground assault, a view that Harris shared.1*® Wil- dermuth cited artillery as the real source of the Allies’ rapid success on the ground; bombing killed only a tiny handful of German soldiers. Lisieux, and Coutances, eradicated the urban areas almost entirely. In the first two days of the campaign, 3,000 French civilians were killed.” The village of Aunay-sur-Odon, bombed to stop the move- counted 2,307 bombardments in June, 1,016 of them on the north coast provinces, most against railway targets. In July there were fewer raids, 1,195 in total, in August 1,121.14 The great majority of made.“4 The raid on July 18 by 942 bombers dropped an extraordinary 6,800 tons on the city and its eastern environs; the result did little to the German defenders, who had largely withdrawn toa the advance of ground forces. By the end of the invasion a combination of bombing and shelling had left habitable housing for only 8,000 out of the 60,000 people who had lived there.145 the victims was Lieutenant General Lesley McNair, whose mangled body was thrown sixty feet by a bomb and could only be identified by the three
