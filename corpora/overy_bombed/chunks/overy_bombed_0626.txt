This time elaborate precautions were taken to ensure that the 2,400 troops, but with only one casualty.4“8 Aachen was turned into a wasteland. the port and the entire garrison. The post-raid analysis carried out by SHAEF concluded that the bombing had not done much to assist the eventual ground assault, a view that Harris shared.14° Wil- The second port was Royan at the mouth of the river Gironde, where the garrison had also refused to surrender when the whole surrounding area had been liberated. The presence of German forces made it difficult for the Allies to use the neighboring port of Bordeaux, and in December 1944, SHAEF was requested by the local American army commander to lay on a heavy bombing to push the garrison to abandon the fight. On the night of January 4-5, 1945, 347 Lancasters dropped 1,576 tons, including 285 4,000-pound “blockbusters”; around 85 percent of the town was destroyed and 490 French civilians (and 47 German soldiers) were killed.
