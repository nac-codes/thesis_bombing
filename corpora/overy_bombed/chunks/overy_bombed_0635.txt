uld be done without better photographic intelligence of the camp itself. There was extensive reconnaissance material on the nearby Monowitz plant and other war-economic targets around Auschwitz, but although some photographs showed areas of the camp, the extermination center had not been the object of a specific reconnaissance operation.+** Unknown to Spaatz, the War Department in Washington had already been lobbied several rejected the request (and did so again when lobbied in November)./®° Two weeks later the Foreign Office informed Sinclair that since the deportation of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz-Birkenau appeared to have been halted, there was no longer any need to consider an operation to bomb it. On September 1, 1944, Spaatz was instructed to pursue the idea no further.1®! There has been much academic argument over the question of whether an operation against the Birkenau extermination facility or the railway lines was feasible or not.1®2 There is no doubt that had it been a priority target for the Allies, it certainly could have been bombed. At just the time that the Allies were considering the requests from the Jewish Agency to undertake the bombing, the U.S. Fifteenth Air Force began a series of raids on the I.G. Farben complex at Monowitz, where the prisoners in the Auschwitz labor camp were marched to work every day. Auschwitz had been on the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces’ target list since at least December 1943, when plans were drawn up for attacks on German oil and chemical plants in eastern Europe.1® The first raid on August 20, 1944, hit Monowitz accurately, a second on September 13 was hampered by enhanced German antiaircraft defenses, the third and fourth attacks on December 18 and 26 did more damage to the plant, and it was finally abandoned in January 1945 as the Red Army drew near. The damage was not extensive and output of methanol (from one of the completed parts of the site) was reduced by only 12 percent. The raids showed, however, that o
