The raids showed, however, that operations over Auschwitz were indeed feasible; only six aircraft were lost despite the strengthening of German defensive measures.1 should be done.*®= The Operation Frantic shuttle bombing to bases in the Ukraine had been temporarily suspended at Soviet insistence, which ruled out supply missions by the Eighth Air Force. Al- tainly confirmed the Soviet side in the decision not to allow further shuttle bombing until mid-September, when Polish resistance was almost over.1*? On the night of August 8-9 three Polish aircrews still held out.1® In this case the operational conditions were similar to a putative attack on Auschwitz-Birkenau. The difference in the Allied response in the late summer of 1944 can perhaps best be of Romania’s armed forces and to help the approaching Russians.1© In the end, whether bombing Auschwitz-Birkenau would have had any impact on the conduct of a genocide that had almost run its The arguments about what was possible in the bombing of eastern Europe, and under what operational conditions, highlights the very different circumstances faced by Allied air forces when confronted with the challenges of distance and geography. For at least the first half of the war, targets in eastern and southeastern Europe were difficult to reach from any bases the RAF might have in the Middle East or North Africa. Navigation problems were magnified for flights from desert airfields across inhospitable terrain with poor mapping and reconnaissance, while maintaining heavy bombers in the heat and dust of the Middle East, thousands of miles from the sophisticated maintenance and logistical system in Britain, was a Sisyphean task. From bases in England, however, most aircraft could not reach distant targets; with the advent of the Lancaster and the Mosquito it took time before serious raids could be mounted even against Berlin, and most of the flight was across the heavily defended areas of the Low Countries and Germany.
