Union than bombing Germany.!” The British side agreed with the plan and drew up a detailed study in April 1940 for deploying forty-eight Blenheim light bombers from bases in Syria and Iraq, supported by sixty-five Glenn Martin bombers bought by the French from American production. RAF planners thought little of Soviet air and antiaircraft defenses, and, like the French, hoped that a three-month attack on Batum, Baku, and Grozny might lead sooner or later “to the complete collapse of the war potential of the USSR,” as well as disastrous repercussions for Germany.’ Chamberlain's cabinet thought the campaign too risky, and following the German attack on France on May 10, the French abandoned the idea. But the RAF remained in a state of readiness to eliminate the entire Soviet oil industry in three months, assuming an average margin of error of seventy-five yards, a conclusion entirely at odds with all the bombing trials conducted in 1939 and 1940.1” The plan was revived again in June 1941 in the knowledge that Germany was about to attack the Soviet Union. There were strong recommendations from the British embassy in Cairo and the chiefs of staff to use two squadrons of Wellington bombers and two of Blenheims for a month of intensive attacks, not only to deny the oil to the Germans but “to remind the Soviet of consequences of acceding to German demands.”! Planning was completed by August 1941, but once again operational and strategic reality prevented a campaign in which the means were manifestly inadequate for the military and political ends desired. When an impromptu attack was finally made on German oil supplies in Romania on June 11, 1942, by thirteen B-24 Liberator bombers from the airbase at Fayid in Egypt, the result was described by the Middle East RAF headquarters as a fiasco. The aircraft flew singly and independently; not one reached the oilfield at EMME, but instead they dropped their bombs wherever they could; three returning aircraft landed at Ankara airp
