domination. Czech informers made it clear that as allies, the Czech people should not be subjected to area bomb- ing, which would provoke “serious resentment.”!®! The Yugoslav partisan armies welcomed precise raids on German targets, but not raids on the major cities. The propaganda made much of Allied claims for bombing accuracy against military targets but was occasionally let down by the translation. A leaflet destined for Axis Bulgaria in late 1943 had the English “blockbuster bomb” (designed to destroy factories or military facilities) translated into Bulgarian as “homewrecker.”282 These political imperatives were integrated as far as possible with the military planning directed at eastern Europe, although the promise of accuracy was as difficult to fulfill in this case as it had been in the west. For the Western Allies there was only one principal target in eastern Europe once the area came within effective bombing range. The oil-producing region around IMM in Romania supplied around 3 million tons of oil annually to Germany and Italy out of a total production of 5-6 million tons. For Germany, Romanian exports in 1943 amounted to one-third of all German oil products.1£2 Since oil was a major target for the Combined Bomber Offensive, the interruption of Romanian supplies assumed a high priority. The RAF had begun to explore the possibility of raiding MM in the spring of 1942 to aid the Soviet Union, but the operation, at the limit of aircraft range, was regarded as impossible with current strengths.
