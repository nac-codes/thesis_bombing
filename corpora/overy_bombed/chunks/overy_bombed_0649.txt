Portal was keen to allocate three skilled Lancaster crews because he was not confident that American pilots would be able to navigate the 1,850-mile trip successfully, but in the end the raid launched on August 1, 1943, was made only by the B-24 aircraft of the recently constituted Ninth Air Force.18° The American operation was first code-named Statesman, then changed in May to “Soapsuds.” Churchill disliked the new choice—“unworthy of those who would face the hazards”—and it was eventually christened, with Roosevelt’s approval, Operation Tidalwave.1®” The operation required a great deal of preparation. It was originally scheduled for June 23, 1943, but postponed not only because priority was given to air support for the invasion of Sicily in July 1943, but because the period of intelligence research and crew training took much longer than anticipated. For the American airmen involved the raid was a daunting prospect. When a British adviser appeared at the airbase at Benghazi from which the raid was to be mounted, he found the morale of the crew “about as bad as it could possibly be”: they told him that they lacked experience of the low-level bombing chosen to maximize the impact of the attack; that they had no previous experience of operations over such long distances; that the countries over which they had to fly were completely exotic, “populated by cannibals” for all they knew. Rigorous training and better information on the value of the raid contributed to overcoming the worst fears, but there could be no disguising that EMI was one of the most heavily defended targets in Europe.!®* American intelligence on German defenses was in general poor, because the target was remote from the main operational theaters. Instead of the 100 antiaircraft guns identified, there proved to be well over 200; in
