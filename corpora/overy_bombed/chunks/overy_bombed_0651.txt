EMM# in Romania Although Churchill was willing, as he told Eden, “to put the screw very hard on Turkey” to modify its neutrality for the RAE, the attack on IMM when it came was made by American air forces acting under pressure from the American Joint Chiefs to act quickly to block Axis oil supplies.4®* The British contribution to the opening raid was to supply good maps of the region and large-scale models of raid launched on August 1, 1943, was made only by the B-24 aircraft of the recently constituted Ninth Air Force.1%° eventually christened, with Roosevelt’s approval, Operation Tidalwave.18” The operation required a great deal of preparation.

He long expected an Allied attack and introduced regular exercises for the defenses as well as establishing a line of radar stations and a corps of visual observers in the Balkan region.
