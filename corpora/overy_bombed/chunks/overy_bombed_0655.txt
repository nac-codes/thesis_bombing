was one of the most heavily defended targets in Europe.88 American intelligence on German defenses was in general poor, more than 200 Me109, Me110, and Ju88 aircraft, as well as the Romanian and Bulgarian air forces along the line of attack. The defense of ME was under the command of Lieutenant General Alfred to distract any attacker.18* This was as formidable a defense as any available in Germany itself. For the American crews it meant an operation that was likely to be more suicidal than any they would aircraft plant in Austria, but on this occasion suffered only two losses against the lightest of resistance.12°  The results of the IMM raid fell short of the ambition to knock the complex out for months, but enough serious damage was done to reduce output substantially at three major refineries and to which time the pre-raid levels of output were once again restored. Losses of 40 percent of the force could not be sustained, and the Allied air forces had other urgent priorities in Italy and southern Germany. At a conference on bombing strategy in Gibraltar in November 1943 between Spaatz, Eaker, Tedder, and Doolittle, the main concern was coordinating attacks on German targets from England and Italy. It was agreed that Balkan capitals might make a good morale target, and Sofia was bombed shortly afterward, but oil in southeastern Europe had for the moment disappeared as a priority.122 Not until March 17, 1944, was Spaatz informed by Arnold that the Combined Chiefs of Staff favored a renewed attack on HMMl when good weather permitted, but the changing strategic situation, with Soviet forces driving on southeastern Europe, gave priority to bombing communications around Bucharest rather than oil, and the target was again postponed.1®? The change back to oil came later after Spaatz lost his argument with Portal over the best strategy for the pre-Normandy bombing and had to accept the Transportation Plan. In order to get at oil surreptitiously, he allowed Eaker to send
