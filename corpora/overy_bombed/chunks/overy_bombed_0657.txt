the Combined Chiefs of Staff favored a renewed attack on MMMM— when good weather permitted, but the changing strategic situation, with Soviet forces driving on southeastern Europe, gave priority to bombing communications around Bucharest rather than oil, and the target was again postponed.1*? The change back to oil The result was a devastating series of twenty-four raids against [MMM between April 5 and August 19, 1944, under the command of Major General Nathan Twining. Twenty of the raids were offensive there were 278 heavy and 280 light guns, including the new heavy-caliber 105- and 128-millimeter, supported by 1,900 smoke generators. The oilfield was designated a German “stronghold” and Gerstenberg was appointed by the German high command as “German Commandant of the Romanian Oil Region.”!®> But this time the American bombers flew at high altitude, protected by large numbers of long-range P-38 and P-51 fighters.
