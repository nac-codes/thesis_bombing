d had killed 12,000 people, 6,000 of them refugees sitting in trains on the track in the belief that the air-raid siren was only a test. The raid was indeed a heavy one, hitting part of the residential area of the city, but official figures showed only 231 killed and 1,567 buildings destroyed or damaged.?° From June 1944 oil was finally given a top priority and oil targets in Czechoslovakia and Poland were added to the list of potential targets throughout the region.2™ Right to the end politics played a part in bombing calculations. Strategic attacks against targets in Ger- many, Austria, and Hungary could be undertaken either by visual or by blind-bombing techniques against any military target defined in the broadest sense, including “targets of opportunity.” Over Czech and Polish territory crews were only permitted to bomb the designated military target visually or in exceptional cases by blind bombing, but no opportunity targets were permitted, to minimize the risk of casualties among allied populations.2%  The most urgent need was to devise a way of ensuring that American and British aircraft did not accidentally bomb or strafe the advancing Soviet lines. In April 1944 a bomb line was agreed, with the Soviet side in southeastern Europe from Constanza, on the Romanian coast, through Bucharest, GM and Budapest. Only the last three could be the object of bomb attack, and American airmen were warned to learn the silhouettes and markings of Soviet aircraft.2°° The Soviet forces continued to inform their allies of the changing front line through the Allied missions in Moscow, though the MAAF had also posted representatives informally at the headquarters of the Soviet army group in the Balkans to try to minimize any hazard. A zone of forty miles in front of the advancing Red Army was agreed as the limit for British and American bomber operations, but information about where the line was had to come through a cumbersome process of consultation in the Soviet capital.
