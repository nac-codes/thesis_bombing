ed Army was agreed as the limit for British and American bomber operations, but information about where the line was had to come through a cumbersome process of consultation in the Soviet capital. As the Allied air forces converged from east and west, the danger of inadvertent bombing increased. On November 7, 1944, a force of twenty-seven P-38 Lightnings strafed and bombed a Soviet column in Yugoslavia fifty miles behind the Soviet front line, killing the commander and five others. Three of the nine Soviet fighters sent to protect the column were shot down.2 Stalin’s military headquarters made a strong protest and suggested a bomb line running from Stettin on the Baltic coast down through Vienna to Zagreb and Sarajevo in Yugoslavia, leaving many designated oil and transport targets out of bounds to Western air forces. The Combined Chiefs of Staff refused to accept a bomb line farther north than the Danube, but offered to set up a proper liaison organization with advancing Soviet armies to avoid further mishaps. When Moscow rejected the idea of any collaboration on the ground, Spaatz and Eaker worked out their own bomb line and communicated it to Moscow, sealing Dresden’s fate a few weeks later.?°° The Soviet desire to reduce the bombing in eastern Europe was not disinterested, since by that stage of the war Moscow wanted to capture resources, equipment, and plants intact before the strategic air forces obliterated them shortly before they fell into the Soviet sphere. After the war, the formal communist line was to argue that bombing in the teeth of the Red Army advance had been carried out by the agents of capitalist imperialism to weaken the future socialist economy.  Unlike the situation in the western zones of Germany and Austria, it proved impossible for American or British intelligence teams to survey systematically the damage that bombing had done to the industrial and infrastructure targets in eastern Europe, or to establish how effective the political offen
