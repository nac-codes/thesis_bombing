Antiaircraft guns and fighters stationed in the Low Countries formed, as in France, part of the air defense rampart around the European fortress, which in the Netherlands included ten squadrons of night fighters by 1944 and seventy-four sites for radar and electronic warfare.22* Regiments of German fire-protection police were also stationed in the Low Countries to supplement the efforts of the local population organized, in the Dutch case, in an Air Protection Service (Luchtbeschermingsdienst) first set up in April 1936 and organized by urban dis- trict, street, and housing block. The attitude of the population to the raiding was complex, since many Allied aircraft crashed in the Low Countries, and in many cases surviving crew were helped by the local population or benefited from escape networks.
