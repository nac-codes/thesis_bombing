The occupied states had their own civil defense organizations, but they were in general less well resourced than in Britain or Germany. This would have mat- tered less if the bombing of military objectives had been as accurate as the Allies claimed (and on occasion achieved). The bombing of Brest, Le Havre, Caen, Mortsel, The Hague, Bucharest, and a dozen or more other cities exposed the hollowness of any claim to operational precision.

Until the missile age, the long-range intercontinental bomber was designed to deliver a first- or second-strike nuclear attack of annihilating power against the enemy. This did not rule out the use of convent
