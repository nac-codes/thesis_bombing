The reconstruction began at first against a background of economic crisis and legal wrangling over ownership of the ruins, and in many cases the bolder plans were shelved in favor of cheaper or more feasible solutions.1® The most ambitious building took place in Germany, where more than half the urban area in the major cities had been destroyed. Some thirty-nine cities had at least a million cubic meters of rubble to clear, but in Berlin the figure was 55 million, in Hamburg 35 million, and in Cologne 24 million.4® Coping with life among the ruins were millions of  Daemana ced Tn Vern d Fav rrnnen in anllacs and shaanlen shact AF EAAA annlinn and aahanlina A Adlanatinn Af Deitch nanan crnelenes eiaitina Tibaale in 1017 werner ch anin reranleler and eatiann anncintina afint a. ss . than nuclear weapons.
