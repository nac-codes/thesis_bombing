strably lacked in 1941.2 For American planners really would be able to paralyze a city at a stroke.4° The principal lesson learned from the bombing campaigns of the Second World War was the need for even greater and more indiscriminate destruc- a memorial to the bombing and to relocate the town on the mainland, but tradition prevailed and St.-Malo was rebuilt on the existing site. The only place to be moved as a result of bombing was the Italian town of Cassino. The ruins on the mountainside were declared a national monument and a new and larger town was built on more level ground a mile away from the original site. City centers, where much of the damage had occurred, were also generally restored, with the exception of the heavily bombed British port of Bristol and the German port at Kiel, where there was sufficient bomb damage to allow the relocation of the center to a more geographically convenient quarter.*1 In Germany the reconstruction was slower than elsewhere because of occupation and economic crisis, but here too the cities were all restored on their original sites despite the exceptional level of destruction. This strong sense of belonging, even to a ruined landscape, was explained by a senior German offi- cer to his fellow prisoners of war early in 1945: If there is such a thing as existence in spirit or will alone, without body or matter, that is the life of the German cities. Only their sentimental appeal still holds them together. Cologne has been evacuated time and time again, but the inhabitants still manage to drift back to the heaps of rubble simply because they once bore the name “home.” Past associations are so much more powerful than the necessities of war that the evacuees resent leaving and rush back again long before the danger is over.22 Nevertheless, German cities were remodeled after the bombing, while their demographic geography changed. By 1950, cities with more than 100,000 people made up 27 percent of the population in West Germany, whe
