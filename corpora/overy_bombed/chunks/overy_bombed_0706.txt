less, German cities were remodeled after the bombing, while their demographic geography changed. By 1950, cities with more than 100,000 people made up 27 percent of the population in West Germany, whereas they had constituted one-third in 1939; the population of communities with fewer than 20,000 inhabitants increased from 53 percent to 59 percent over the same period. Hamburg, where the damage and depopulation had been among the most extensive, almost recovered its prewar population level by 1950, but experienced a substantial relocation of population  Page 430 of 562 TA% by 1946.** By the 1950s Britain could no longer afford to be a major player in the air war of the future. No effective heavy bomber was developed for the postwar force, and in 1950 the RAF had to bor- more than 80 million of their inhabitants in a first or second strike.1* British planners, working with a much more limited nuclear capability, identified fifty-five Soviet cities for destruction.

In Germany the reconstruction was slower than elsewhere because of occupation and economic crisis, but within the city limits. The inner zones housed 850,000 people in 1939, but by 1950 only 467,000; the outer zones increased from 848,000 to over a million.22 The geographical relocation was typical of much of the postwar reconstruction, since the destruction of older urban environments presented an opportunity to build modern residential housing with less congestion and more amenities.
