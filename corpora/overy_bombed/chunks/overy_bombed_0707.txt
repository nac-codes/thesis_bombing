cal of much of the postwar reconstruction, since the destruction of older urban environments presented an opportunity to build modern residential housing with less congestion and more amenities. Wider roads and open spaces were regarded by town planners as desirable improvements to old-fashioned and inconvenient urban structures. “The Blitz has been a planner’s windfall,” wrote the British scientist Julian Huxley about the British experience. “It is the psychological moment to get real planning in our towns.”“‘ In reality the expense involved and the persistent arguments between local authorities and architects about what was desirable or expedient left many of the plans on the drawing board. The American social scientist Leo Grebler inves- tigated twenty-eight western European cities from four countries in 1954 and found that in general there was little radical urban rebuilding and strong pressures for continuity. The actual amount of damage, even in heavily bombed cities, was less than the immediate images of smashed streets and housing suggested. The temptation for municipal authorities all over Europe (who needed to restore local tax revenues) was to use what was still standing as fully as possible and to rebuild around it rather than engage in further demolition.2* In Germany the extent of the problem of homelessness was amplified by the large-scale refugee problem as Germans expelled from eastern Europe arrived in the western zones of occupation. This forced migration encouraged the rapid rebuilding and repair of existing structures alongside cheap standard housing built on existing foundations. By 1961, 3.1 million houses had been restored or rebuilt.2° In no case did Grebler find evidence that the threat of nuclear bombing influenced city planning or house design, a discovery that he attributed partly to “improvidence or defeatism” in the face of the nuclear menace, but principally to the willingness to  Page 431 of 562 74% hanging over them.” Recovery was i
