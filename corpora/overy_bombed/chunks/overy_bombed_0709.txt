The longer-term effects on civilians have been little studied in comparison with the postwar psychological damage done to soldiers as a result of the stresses of combat. The memory of bombing as an expression of collective public awareness of the victims (though not of the survivors) was also much less developed than the public memory of military losses. Much of that public memory was linked to religious monuments as symbols of the injury to Europe’s Christian values in the vortex of total war. In Britain part of Coventry Cathedral was kept in its ruined state as both a local and a national monument; in Germany the Frauenkirche in Dresden was a standing indictment of the firestorm until its rebuilding in the early twenty-first century as a symbol of reconciliation and a final settlement of postwar accounts.*® The Nicholas Church in Hamburg and the Kaiser Wilhelm Church in the center of Berlin were also left in their ruined state as a visible reminder to the German people of the cost of war against the home front.
