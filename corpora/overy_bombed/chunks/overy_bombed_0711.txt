But Bomber Command was for decades after 1945 denied a collective monument to the dead. The erection of a statue to Harris in 1992 outside the RAF church on London’s Strand provoked widespread criticism, protest, and demonstrations. A memorial to the dead of Bomber Command was finally erected and dedicated only in 2012, in London’s Green Park, but once again it provoked renewed debate about whether those who inflicted such damage on civilian communities ought to be remembered in the same spirit in which the “Few” of the defensive Battle of Britain have been lionized in British public history.
