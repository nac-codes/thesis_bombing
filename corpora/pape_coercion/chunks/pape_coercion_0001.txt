Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1984), counted 77 major cases of military coercion in international crises since ancient times. This figure underestimates the full universe of military coercion because it leaves out the coercive effect of military threats in wars.

States involved in serious international disputes commonly engage in passionate debate over the utility of military (and nonmilitary) instruments of coercion.2 Leaders are often drawn to military coercion because it is per­ ceived as a quick and cheap solution to otherwise difficult and expensive in­ ternational problems. Nonetheless, statesmen very often overestimate the prospects for successful coercion and underestimate the costs.

The other side of the ledger is virtually blank. There are almost no instances in which coercion was not tried when a credible claim can be made that it would likely have succeeded. Studying military coercion may be even more relevant to policy now than it was in the past. The end of the Cold War and the rise of potential regional hegemons are shifting national security policy away from deterring pre­ dictable threats toward responding to unpredictable threats after they
