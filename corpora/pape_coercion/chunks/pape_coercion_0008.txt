also inadequate, because the vulnerability of North Vietnam's population actually decreased as time went by. A comparable weakness confounds the final theory, changing the military balance through air attack. This theory leads to similar predictions in both cases, since the military targets subjected to attack were nearly identical in the two periods. The existing theories are inadequate because they are incomplete. Al­ though some authors have considered more than one of these factors, none has carefully defined the relations among variables, the strength of effects, and the conditions under which they occur, and the empirical testing of ex- 10 Schelling, Arms and Influence; George H.

If one views American interests in Vietnam as declining during the war because of rapprochement with China, the balance of interest explanation does still worse, since the later bombing campaigns were more success­ ful than the earlier ones.
