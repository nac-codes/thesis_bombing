balance of interest explanation does still worse, since the later bombing campaigns were more success­ ful than the earlier ones.

[5]  File: --- pape_coercion.pdf --- Page 6 --- Bombing to Win isting hypotheses has been surprisingly thin.B Further, four analytic flaws common to nearly all work on the subject have impeded the advance of our understanding of how military coercion operates. First, coercion is generally assumed to operate according to the same principles as deterrence. Although deterrence and coercion are complemen­ tary activities, however, they pose distinct theoretical problems because co­ ercion is harder. Threats that deter may not coerce. Deterrence is made easier by the" aggressor's handicap." In the era of na­ tionalism, the homeland territory is normally much more valuable to the de­ fender than it is to any assailant. Even if both value the stakes equally, the attacker, who stands to make gains, is likely to be more risk-averse than the defender, who stands to suffer losses. Attackers also bear the burden of dis­ turbing the status quO.14 As a result, deterrers will typically pay higher costs to retain possessions than attackers will to take them. In situations of coercion, the victim assumes a role similar to the deter­ rer's. Hence, coercers operate under the same handicap as the attacker in deterrence. The victim is likely to value the stakes at issue more highly than the assailant, particularly when the coercer demands the surrender of homeland territory. Since the targets of coercion are normally willing to ac­ cept higher costs and risks than the coercers, potential assailants are likely to be deterred from even attempting coercion unless they possess superior mil­ itary capabilities that can protect them from the vi
