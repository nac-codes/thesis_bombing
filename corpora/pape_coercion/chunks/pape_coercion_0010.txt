r costs and risks than the coercers, potential assailants are likely to be deterred from even attempting coercion unless they possess superior mil­ itary capabilities that can protect them from the victim's retaliation; by im­ plication, thus, attempts by one nuclear superpower to coerce another will be rare because protection against retaliation is impossible. Furthermore, inasmuch as the coercer bears the ultimate responsibility for initiating hos- 13 We have only one serious empirical study of military coercion, which is limited to nu­ clear cases and does not always distinguish coercion from deterrence: Betts, Nuclear Blackmail. Neither Walter J. Petersen, "Deterrence and Compellence: A Critical Assessment of Conven­ tional Wisdom," International Studies Quarterly 30 (1986): 269-94, nor George, Limits of Coercive Diplomacy, systematically compares alternative explanations for success and failure. Barry M. Blechman and Stephen S. Kaplan with David K. Hall et al., Force without War: U.S. Armed Forces as a Political Instrument (Washington, D.C.: Brookings, 1978), studied 33 instances of peacetime uses of force but concluded little about military coercion except that it rarely achieves its objectives (pp. 89, 523-26). 14 On these points, see Paul Kecskemeti, Strategic Surrender: The Politics of Victory and Defeat (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1958); Robert Jervis, The Illogic of American Nuclear Strat­ egy (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1984); Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, "Judg­ ment under Uncertainty," Science 185 (1974): 1124-30; and Morton A. Kaplan, "The Calculus of Deterrence," World Politics 11 (October 1958): 20-43. David Baldwin, "Power Analysis and World Politics," World Politics 31 (January 1979): 161-94, argues that compellence (coercion) and deterrence are indistinguishable and that the alleged difficulty of the former results from a practice of calling hard cases compellent and easy ones deterrent. But the distinction is not merely sema
