deterrence are indistinguishable and that the alleged difficulty of the former results from a practice of calling hard cases compellent and easy ones deterrent. But the distinction is not merely semantic. Changing the status quo is different from maintaining it, as well as harder. Petersen, "Deterrence and Compellence," finds that only 24 percent of compellent threats were successful in the. cases he examined, compared to 63 percent of deterrent threats, al­ though the difference disappears when both side's expected costs of war are controlled for. The meaning of this finding is unclear, however, because his samples are not comparable. The average severity of the coercive cases is lower than that of the deterrent ones (p. 282).

Military coercion, in short, is about hard cases. Although the threat of a costly war of attrition may deter aggression,I6 successful coercion requires even stronger sanctions. The prospect of protracted war influenced the po­ litical calculations of all the major powers before World War II but had little effect on their decisions once they were involved in the war. Despite heavy costs, none of the powers on either side even considered surrender until faced with total defeat. The second common flaw is to ignore one of the main strategies of coer­ cion. Social scientists have long studied the effectiveness of both threats to civilians ("punishment") and threats of military failure ("denial") for deter­ rence. Punishment threatens to inflict costs heavier than the value of any­ thing the chall
