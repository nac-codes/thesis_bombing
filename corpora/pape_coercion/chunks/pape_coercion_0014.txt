gly, a definition of coercion limited to punishment of civilians makes it impossible to explain many coercive outcomes.21 Third, the productive study of coercion must recognize that the vulnera­ bility of target states to an assailant's coercive attacks varies. Societies differ in their vulnerability to countercivilian attacks according to such factors as their degree of urbanization, their use of burnable building materials, and the susceptibility of their food supplies to destruction. Similarly, target states with different military strategies vary in their vulnerability to denial attacks. Strategies that rely on large-scale mechanized operations are partic­ ularly vulnerable because they depend on massive logistic flows that make excellent targets for air attack. At the opposite end of the spectrum, guerrilla fighters are much less vulnerable to coercion because they need little logis­ tic support. Matching the coercer's strategy to the target state's specific vul­ nerabilities can be decisive: it will determine how severe the effects of the coercer's attacks are and thus how strong the pressure on the target's polit­ ical calculations. Theories that do not account for differences in vulnerabil­ ity cannot accurately predict coercive outcomes. Finally, the existing literature glosses over differences between conven­ tional and nuclear coercion.22 Most formal analyses have concentrated on nuclear coercion, and generally operate at levels of abstraction above the key causal factors in military coercion, namely, the military strategies of the assailant and victim. "Strategy" in formal models normally refers to deci­ sions about whether to stand firm or make concessions, not to different 21 Further, if policy makers believe that punishment threats are the best coercive strategy against all possible victims and if this premise is wrong, failing to examine the fundamental causes of coercion can have disastrous consequences in practice. Policy makers could easily assume
