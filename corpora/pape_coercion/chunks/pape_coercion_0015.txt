trategy against all possible victims and if this premise is wrong, failing to examine the fundamental causes of coercion can have disastrous consequences in practice. Policy makers could easily assume that failure results from errors in execution, rather than the erroneous basic premise, and so repeat past mistakes again and again. 22 Prominent examples are Schelling, Arms and Influence; George et al., Limits of Coercive Diplomacy; and, Quester, Deterrence before Hiroshima.

Different military strategies available to an assailant are usually abstracted into a single variable in which different varieties of mili­ tary costs are treated as wholly interchangeable.23 Although it makes no logical difference what type of weapon is used for coercion, in practice the vast gap in destructive power between nuclear and conventional weapons means that coercion in these two circumstances op­ erates quite differently. Nuclear weapons can almost always inflict more pain than any victim can withstand; if the coercer's threat is credible, even the most determined opponents can be overwhelmed.24 By contrast, the damage that conventional munitions can inflict is quite low when com­ pared to the pain thresholds of modern nation-states. As a result, punish­ ment strategies are rarely effective. If the coercer is not deterred from making a threat, therefore, nuclear coercion works better than conventional coercion. To overcome the problems with these single-independent-variable ap­ proaches, we must, first, come up with a more comprehensive theory that incorporates the existing explanations into a set of conditional propositions about success and failure in military coercion. Second, we must test the new theory against an appropriate body of empirical evidence. METHOD AND ARGUMENT The overarching goal of this book is to
