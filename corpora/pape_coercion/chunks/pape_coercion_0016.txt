ions about success and failure in military coercion. Second, we must test the new theory against an appropriate body of empirical evidence. METHOD AND ARGUMENT The overarching goal of this book is to present a theory that explains the success and failure of military coercion and to test it against the outcomes of all the strategic air offensives employed in international disputes during the twentieth century. The general propositions I propose in this book hold across space and time and account for a large amount of the variance, but they have limits. Nonmilitary variables, such as domestic political, organi足 zational, and psychological factors-which can also affect outcomes-are treated as exogenous in order to study the specifically military elements of coercion. Although I do not construct a complete blueprint for coercion, my conclusions may help policy makers distinguish between strategies likely to succeed and those likely to fail. Also, in order to develop my theory of mili足 tary coercion more fully, I have had to put aside many important related questions: whether availability of coercive tools makes states militant and helps to cause or to escalate wars; under what conditions states choose co足 ercive over ordinary military strategies; and whether coercive force should 23 For example, see Ellsberg, "Theory and Practice of Blackmail." 24 Robert Jervis, "The Political Effects of Nuclear Weapons;" International Security 1} (Fall 19B8): 8<>-90.

Two kinds of tests are employed: quantitative analysis of all thirty-three strategic air campaigns to determine whether the theory's predictions cor足 relate with outcomes, together with detailed case studies of five of the most important instances (Japan 1945, Germany 1945, Korea 1953, Vietnam 1965-1968 and 1972, and Iraq 1991) to determine whether t
