e gray area between coercion by denial and war fighting would be a problem only if war fighting ruled out coercion or if it were impossible to observe the difference between coercive success and complete military de­ feat. In fact, the pursuit of decisive victory does not necessarily rule out co­ ercion. The coercer, whatever the set of demands for which it is prepared to use force, would almost always prefer to obtain them by the less costly method of coercion than by the more expensive alternative of winning total military victory first and imposing its demands afterward. In addition, the difference between successful coercion by denial and complete military vic­ tory depends on the particularities of the target state's military strategy. If the strategy is fairly ambitious, such as North Vietnam's effort to conquer the South through a massive conventional offensive in 1972, then relatively modest degradation of military capabilities may be sufficient to undermine 3 Some analysts have attempted to draw a clear distinction between coercion and war fighting. The deSirability of such a distinction is understandable in the work of Alexander George, for example, which explores usable alternatives to the unwinnability of nuclear war and the undesirability of an all-out military effort in Vietnam. Since war fighting itself can also be an effective coercive strategy, however, insisting on this distinction would exclude many important cases and ignore the most important coercive dynamics in others, such as Germany, Japan, Korea, North Vietnam, and Iraq.

George, William Simons, and David Hall, The Limits of Coercive Diplomacy: Laos, Cuba, and Vietnam (Boston: Little, Brown, 1971), pp. 16-19. 4 The difference between coercion and war fighting is separate from the difference in deci­ sion making roles between national leaders and military officers in the field. Whether pur­ suing coercion or war fighting, the task of national leaders is to resolve trade-offs
