e difference in deci­ sion making roles between national leaders and military officers in the field. Whether pur­ suing coercion or war fighting, the task of national leaders is to resolve trade-offs among societal values such as military power, territory, and civilian welfare, preserving all of them if possible or choosing among them if necessary. In contrast, military commanders try to widen the options of national leaders by resolving trade-offs among force-to-force considerations, terrain, and time; they do not weigh the relative importance of different social values.

Conversely, if the strategy is relatively unambitious, such as Iraq's effort to hold Kuwait by inflicting thousands of casualties on attacking ground forces, undermining it may require drastic reductions of the target's military capabilities. In this situation, the requirements for coercion by denial are al­ most identical to the requirements for complete military defeat. The close conjunction between coercion and military victory tells us something important: if we find that coercive strategies based on denial are more effective than those based on punishment, then, by implication, the most effective way to compel concessions without achieving decisive vic­ tory is to demonstrate that one actually has the capacity to achieve decisive victory. Further, the overlap between coercion and military victory makes it possible to rate the magnitude of coercive successes. Surrender long before complete military defeat should be regarded an outstanding coercive suc­ cess. By contrast, surrender only shortly before defeat should be considered only a minor success. This standard is important. If we find that coercion by denial does work but produces only minor successes, we must conclude that it is not worth pursuing in cases where coercers are not willing to fight almost all the way to victory. Accordingly, the criteria for failure
