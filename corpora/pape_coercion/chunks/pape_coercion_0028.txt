ery) are poor complements to military coercion over significant interests. Whether employed simultaneously or promised to sweeten deals, they are not likely to influence the victim's decision significantly, since they are likely to be trivial compared to the territorial interests at stake. In principle the coercer can raise the probability that the threatened costs will actually be inflicted, but in practice the more important question is usu­ ally whether the coercer can inflict sufficient damage to compel concessions. Extremely high credibility that the coercer will impose damage is normally a minimum requirement. In fact, coercive threats are usually highly credi­ ble. They generally occur in war, when there is no reason to doubt the co­ ercer's willingness to inflict damage. In addition, coercers usually possess military capabilities superior to their opponents' and so, except when both sides are nuclear armed, are unlikely to be deterred by fear of retaliation. The final option for the coercer is to reduce the probability that continued resistance will bring the target state the hoped-for benefits. States are willing to pay costs in return for benefits only if they actually expect to gain the ben­ efits. The task for the coercer, therefore, is to thwart the target state's mili­ tary strategy, destroying confidence that it can take or hold the disputed territory. If the target no longer believes that it can achieve its goals at any price, it is likely to concede them. Once there is no hope of military success, any further costs paid by the target state become futile, and its most important incentive becomes avoid­ ing the costs of continued pointless resistance. Even if the coercer makes no special effort to punish the target, continued resistance inherently entails substantial additional costs, including the costs of military operations, eco­ nomic costs, and loss of civilian lives through collateral damage and priva­ tion. Therefore, levels of costs that were
