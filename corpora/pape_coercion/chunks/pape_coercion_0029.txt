substantial additional costs, including the costs of military operations, eco­ nomic costs, and loss of civilian lives through collateral damage and priva­ tion. Therefore, levels of costs that were insufficient to affect the target state's decision calculus as long as military success appeared possible be­ come sufficient to cause surrender.

If the coercer's attacks leave the target state still capable of defending its homeland but not peripheral terri­ tory, only the latter will be surrendered. For example, in 1972 the United States was able to prevent North Vietnam from continuing offensive opera­ tions but not from retaining control over territories it occupied in the South. Accordingly, Washington was able to pressure Hanoi into a cease-fire agree­ ment but not into a withdrawal. Coercion can succeed only when the costs of surrender are lower than the costs of resistance. If surrender were costless-beyond the value of the ter­ ritorial interests conceded-states would always surrender when the prob­ ability of victory disappeared. Surrender, however, sometimes involves serious costs in addition to the territorial benefits abandoned, such as en­ forced change of government, destruction of social institutions, or the threat of genocide. When these costs equal or exceed the costs of continued resis­ tance, coercion will fail. Surrender will not occur even if the military situa­ tion is hopeless. Strategies of Military Coercion Because the benefits of resistance are not manipulable by the coercer, strategy is limited to three options, each of which aims at one of the manip­ ulable components of the target's decision calculus. Punishment strategies attempt to raise the costs of continued resistance; risk strategies, to raise the probability of suffering costs; denial strategies, to reduce the
