d under all circumstances. Still, there are conditions under which one strategy is more likely to succeed than another. Specifically, in conventional disputes, coercion is most likely to suc­ ceed when directed at military, not civilian, vulnerabilities. Conversely, in nuclear disputes, coercion is likely to be predicated on civilian, not military, vulnerabilities. 7 Schelling, Arms and Influence, p. 89. This logic would suggest that punishment strategies, which seek to maximize current rather than future costs, should never succeed unless targets are irrational. Punishment strategies would have to rely for their effectiveness on emotional reactions to sunk costs, such as frustration, grief, and anger. Architects of punishment-ori­ ented air strategies, as I will show, do rely in part on such reactions. 8 Decapitation, a recent proposal for pursuing both punishment and denial by attacking a single target set, is discussed in Chapter 3. [19]  File: --- pape_coercion.pdf --- Page 20 --- Bombing to Win Conventional Coercion Coercive success is a function of the interactions among the coercer's strategy, the target state's military strategy, and the target state's domestic politics. The denial theory of coercion incorporates six propositions about conventional coercion: 1. Punishment strategies will rarely succeed. Inflicting enough pain to subdue the resistance of a determined adversary is normally beyond the capacity of conventional forces. Punishment strategies will work only when core values are not at stake. 2. Risk strategies will fail. They are diluted, and therefore weaker, versions of punishment. 3. Denial strategies work best. They succeed if and when the coercer undermines the target state's military strategy to control the specific territory in dispute. 4. Surrender of homeland territory is especially unlikely. Nationalist sentiments demand resistance to foreign rule even when physical security cannot be guaranteed. 5. Surrender terms that incorporate heavy
