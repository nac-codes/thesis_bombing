on their degree of urbanization, type of housing construction, and susceptibility to flooding from dam destruc­ tion. Still, the most devastating of all countercivilian campaigns, the bombing of Japan in World War II, killed 900,000 people out of a prewar population of 70 million. Countercivilian attacks can lower morale, in­ crease absenteeism, and cause some deurbanization as refugees flee vul­ nerable cities, but these problems rarely have serious effects on production or cause civilians to put effective pressure on the government to surrender. The worker absentee rate in Japanese industry during 1945 was approxi­ mately 8 percent.IS Fifth, modern states can minimize their vulnerability to countercivilian attacks by defense, evacuation of threatened areas, and rapid adjustment to economic dislocations.16 States can protect themselves against naval blockades through defensive measures such as convoy systems, coun­ teroffensive operations such as antisubmarine patrols and attacks on sub­ marine bases, and by acceleration of shipping production to replace lost tonnage. In World War I, Germany's unrestricted submarine campaign against Britain initially inflicted very heavy losses, but the British were able to contain the problem with the introduction of convoys, later sup­ plemented by laying a mine barrage across the North Sea which blocked German submarine access to the Atlantic. In World War II, Germany's sub­ marine offensive against Britain was initially successful, even despite con­ voying, but was eventually defeated by a combination of improved antisubmarine escorts, air surveillance, and the enormous replacement tonnage provided by British and American shipbuilding industriesP Sim­ ilarly, air attacks against population centers can be opposed by fighters, radar, antiaircraft artillery and missiles, and civil defense. During World War II bombing offensives in Europe by both Allied and German forces were greatly hampered by antiaircraft defenses, and in the Pa
