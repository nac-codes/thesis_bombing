During World War II bombing offensives in Europe by both Allied and German forces were greatly hampered by antiaircraft defenses, and in the Pacific the vul- 14 J.

Is Evacuation of population centers threatened by bombing or by the ad­ vance of enemy troops can further reduce civilian vulnerability. Once city populations have been greatly reduced, additional raids inflict lighter losses, and the outlying districts in which refugees are resettled make very poor targets for bombing. Substitution for shortages further reduces the effects of countercivilian at­ tacks. The relatively slow place at which damage caused by bombing or blockade accumulates allows states to substitute for shortages and thus to ameliorate indirect costs to civilians. The economies of modem nation-states do not have "break points," thresholds of shortages below which sudden collapse occurs; they deteriorate incrementally by a process of successive substitution. Modem techniques in science and administration can com­ pensate for the shortage of a primary good by conservation, more efficient allocation, or discovery of alternatives. The history of wartime food short­ ages in Britain during the Napoleonic wars, World War I, and World War II, illustrates this point. Attempts to blockade Britain into submiss
