The following discussion applies Stephen Van Evera's pathbreaking analysis of "non­ evaluation of strategy" by modem nation-states to the problem of understanding coercive pressures.

The reaction to criticism increases as the costs of state policy rise and as the likelihood of success falls. Accordingly, governments tolerate less dissent within their ranks, suppress leaks, and censor informa­ tion that might tend to undermine support for state policy, such as civilian costs being suffered or risks of military defeat. Within the government, in­ formation is restricted to a smaller circle of officials who believe in the regime's policy.36 The result is that the public, as well as most of the government, is pre­ sented with a rosier picture of the performance of state policy than is actu­ ally the case. Dissenters operate at a disadvantage because of the cushion of legitimacy usually enjoyed by nationalist states. Most people will defer to government statements unless the gap between the official line and reality becomes inescapably obvious. 37 Militaries of states involved in disputes also control information and sup­ press criticism, for the same reasons as government leaders and because evaluation threatens organizational stability. Evaluation promotes change and innovation, which threatens jobs and the status of incumbent leaders of the organization. Hence incumbents tend to oppose, disrupt, or punish seri­ ous evaluation. 38 Although they do not usually enjoy the same legitimacy as governments, their special expertise gives militaries important advantages in avoiding evaluation. Military expertise is largely confined to military in­ stitutions; outside evaluators are usually less knowledgeable
