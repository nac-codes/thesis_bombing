policies may lead to unacceptable costs and risks tends to be ignored or discredited until its import is indisputably clear.4o Additional reasons why coercion tends to come late include unwilling­ ness to abandon sunk costs and states' interests in protecting their reputa­ tions for future conflicts. States could resist, or at least mask, concessions not on the basis of the dispute in isolation but because they believe that a defeat or retreat on one issue is likely to encourage further demands on the state by its adversaries and defections from its allies.41 The combined effect of discouraging criticism and hampering evaluation is that risks of disastrous defeat are often not recognized by either govern­ ments or publics until events make them inescapably obvious. This ten­ dency makes the coercer's task of demonstrating the consequences of failure to concede all the more difficult. Even when costs escalate beyond the ap­ parent value of the issues at stake or when the prospects for achieving goals through further resistance are bleak, states may not recognize the need to surrender until all ambiguity has been eliminated. Nuclear Coercion Unlike conventional coercion, the accepted wisdom on nuclear coercion is mostly right, though incomplete. The focus on civilian punishment which has retarded our understanding of conventional coercion is more accurate for nuclear cases. Current theories, however, focus excessively on coercion under conditions of mutual assured destruction and so exaggerate the role of the balance of interests in successful nuclear coercion. A general under­ standing should incorporate other nuclear situations. The principal source of nuclear coercion is manipulation of civilian vul­ nerability. Nuclear weapons have made it possible to launch sudden, dev­ astating attacks on the vast majority of a state's population simultaneously.42 40 Irving L.
