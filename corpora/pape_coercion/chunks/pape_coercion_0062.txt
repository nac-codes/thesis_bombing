reaching even the attacking state and its allies.46 By contrast, denial makes little difference in nuclear cases. Nuclear weapons do increase the coercer's ability to inflict military as well as civilian damage, but not so dramatically.47 More important, the horrific levels of societal de­ struction in nuclear war are likely to dominate decision making so as to make the prospects for success or failure of military campaigns largely irrelevant. The existing literature on nuclear coercion, as on conventional coercion, has been heavily influenced by ideas imported from work on deterrence. On 43 For a comprehensive discussion, see Charles Glaser, Analyzing Strategic Nuclear Policy (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990). 44 Arthur Katz, Life after Nuclear War (Cambridge, Mass.: Ballinger, 1982). 45 Stephen Cimbala, Strategic War Termination (New York: Praeger, 1986). 46 American nuclear planners do not appear to have considered this last possibility in the massive-retaliation era. If early plans had been executed against the Soviet Union, millions of people in Japan, China, and Europe would have been killed. David A.

When both sides can inflict virtually unlimited pain on each other and when states are nor­ mally willing to endure more risk of pain to defend the status quo than to change it, nuclear coercion is hard for the same reasons and in the same pro­ portion that nuclear deterrence is easy. Under mutually assured destruction (MAD), any potential coercer must consider the possibility of nuclear retaliation and will be unlikely even to at­ tempt coercion unless enormously import
