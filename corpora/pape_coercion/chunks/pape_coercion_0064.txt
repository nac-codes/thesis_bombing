unequal damage exerts coercive leverage on the opponent to accept the coercer's demands. Although Britain in the Suez crisis and the Soviet Union in the Cuban missile crisis had some nuclear retaliatory capabilities, both were tremendously overmatched and both conceded.49 Although the assailant may prevail despite an equal or un­ favorable balance of interests, we should not expect nuclear coercion at­ tempts over trivial issues. Potential assailants will be quite concerned by the significant costs that even modest nuclear retaliation would bring, and will attempt coercion only when they have important interests at stake. 48 Richard K.

If the co­ ercer's capability is relatively unlimited, coercive success is virtually as­ sured. Even if the coercer's nuclear resources are limited, the prospect of damage far worse than the most intense conventional assault will likely co­ erce all but the most resolute defenders. Potential coercers may, however, still be constrained by humanitarian, domestic political, or alliance consid­ erations. Using a nuclear-based risk strategy, the United States was able to compel China to make the necessary concessions to end the Korean War. By 1953 the broad outlines of an armistice in place had been agreed, but the Chinese were inflexible on several minor issues, the most important of which was the repa­ triation of Chinese POWs. To break the deadlock, the United States threat­ ened nuclear bombing and lent the threat credibility by gradually escalating conventional air attacks during the spring of 1953 and warning
