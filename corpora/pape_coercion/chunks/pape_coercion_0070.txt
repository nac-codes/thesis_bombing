As a result, land power has virtually ceased to be an important instrument of punishment, for punishment by land power is usu­ ally possible only after decisive victory. For example, William Tecumseh Sher­ man's march through Georgia and the Carolinas was made possible by the decimation of John Hood's Confederate army at Atlanta and Hood's subse­ quent decision to invade Tennessee rather than oppose Sherman. Similarly, the French occupation of the Ruhr in 1923 was enabled by Germany's defeat in World War I and subsequent disarmament.55 With continuous fronts, land power can inflict punishment only through attrition of the enemy army, in the hope that heavy casualties will levy such pain on the opposing society that it will concede rather than face further losses. Although attrition often plays a large role in denial campaigns, however, it is rarely pursued as a punishment strategy because the coercer is likely to suffer as much as the target. In 1916 German leaders planned a protracted attrition operation against the French lines at Verdun. Their purpose was partly denial, for they hoped that "bleed­ ing its forces to death" would so weaken the French army that the specter of ultimate defeat would compel France to peace negotiations. At the same time, they also hoped that the heavy loss of life would inflict such pain on French society that the government would be compelled to change its policies. The operation was a failure; German casualties were nearly as high as French and after five months the attack was abandoned. 56 By contrast to land power, sea power has usually been a weaker instru­ ment of coercion. It can contribute to the application of land power. Com­ mand of the sea allows amphibious operations
