orld War II, they required huge ratios of superiority to succeed. Another way to coerce with sea power is gunboat diplomacy, which in­ volves local naval demonstrations in peacetime. Sea power's relative weak­ ness compared to land power, however, means that this can work effectively only against very weak states or those especially dependent on access to the sea. For example, the British, the greatest practitioners of gunboat diplo­ macy applied this tactic primarily against weak states in peripheral regions such as Latin America, Greece and Portugal, and the Far East, but not against the great powers of Europe. 58 The principal coercive naval strategy is blockade to cut the target state's access to overseas trade. A blockade's effectiveness is determined by the tar­ get state's dependence on overseas trade, which in turn is primarily a func­ tion of geography and economic structure. In principle, a peaceful economic embargo can serve the same function, but in practice, embargo is ineffective if any major supplier fails to cooperate. Amain purpose of naval blockade is to cut off supplies from neutral or uncooperative sources. In general, block­ ade has been potent only against states whose economies are exceptionally dependent on trade. Prior to the industrial revolution, mercantilist economies depended on external trade for large fractions of state income, loss of which could signif­ icantly reduce the capacity of the state to make war, though not as much as proponents of blockade imagined. During the War of the Spanish Succes­ sion, the British twice intercepted Spain's annual treasure jlota, but French and Spanish conduct of the war was little affected because domestic sources of revenue were more important. 59 Blockades also imposed punishment on sectors of civilian society heavily involved in trade, such as the New En­ gland ports in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.60 Nevertheless, both the denial and the punishment effects of blockade were limited.
