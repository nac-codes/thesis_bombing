Some shortages could result, but the economies of the day were not heavily de­ pendent on imports of food or important war materiel. As Adam Smith re­ marked about the effects of a French blockade: "Sir, there is a great deal of ruin in a nation."61 The seventeenth- and eighteenth-century efforts of France, Britain, and Spain to blockade each other never did great harm to 57 Quoted in Alfred J.

At first glance, the industrial revolution might appear to increase the vul­ nerability of states to sea power coercion both because of the vast growth of the volume of sea trade and because of the development of new anticom­ merce weapons such as the submarine and the sea mine. Further, modern industrial war production is often dependent on key raw materi
