volume of sea trade and because of the development of new anticom­ merce weapons such as the submarine and the sea mine. Further, modern industrial war production is often dependent on key raw materials such as oil, rubber, iron ore, aluminum, and other metals. In actuality, however, technical advances in the defense of sea transport and, even more impor­ tant, the improved organizational ability of modern state bureaucracies, have kept pace with these increased vulnerabilities. Submarines can be countered by the defender's own submarines, mines, land-based aircraft, and most important, carrier-based aircraft. Further, merchant shipping can be concentrated into well-guarded convoys, reduc­ ing the raider's attack opportunities as well as providing direct defense for the cargo vessels. 63 Blockades, moreover, can often be evaded by overland trade. The coming of railroads so improved land transportation that, unless the target country is an island, needed materials can usually be obtained from continental al­ lies or neutrals.64 In 1939 Germany imported over 10 percent of its food, 66 percent of its iron ore, 50 percent of lead, 70 percent of copper, 90 percent of tin, 95 percent of nickel, 99 percent of bauxite, 66 percent of oil, 80 percent of rubber, as well as large fractions of its zinc, manganese, molybdenum, mer­ cury, sulfur, cotton, and wool. It managed to obtain all but the rubber and part of the oil requirement by intra-European trade or conquest.65 Modern industrial states with efficient administrative and technical ser­ vices organized and coordinated through bureaucratic institutions have dra­ matically improved their ability to adjust to most types of blockade-induced shortages by conservation, substitution, or technical innovation.
