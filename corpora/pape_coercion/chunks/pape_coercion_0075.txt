In World War I, Germany was totally cut off from nitrates, a crucial ingredient in the manufacture of explosives, but was able to develop synthetic substitutes in time to avoid serious disruption of its war effort. Although totally cut off from rubber imports in World War II, the United States was able to satisfy its needs by conservation and recycling.66 This is not to say that blockades have no effect on modem industrial economies. In World War I, Russia was chronically short of explosives, and in World War II, Germany was never able, despite synthetic production, to satisfy it
