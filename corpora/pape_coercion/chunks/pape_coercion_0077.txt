Aerial bombing capac足 ities in World War I were extremely limited, but by World War II long-range bombers could deliver a few tons of bombs against a target hundreds of miles away. Now, modem aircraft can carry many tons thousands of miles. High-explosive bombs have been augmented, first by incendiary munitions, which can bum large urban areas or even start fire storms, and then by atomic weapons. Navigation difficulties, which made targets hard to find, were overcome by the end of World War II. Finally, from the 1960s onward, precision munitions, from laser-guided bombs to cruise missiles, have dras足 tically reduced the number of weapons needed to destroy specific targets.69 This is not to say that air attack is always easy; defense is possible and often quite effective. Although air defenses rarely enjoy a great tactical ad足 vantage over the attacker, they are much cheaper. Int
