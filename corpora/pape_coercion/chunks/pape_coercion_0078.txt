not to say that air attack is always easy; defense is possible and often quite effective. Although air defenses rarely enjoy a great tactical ad­ vantage over the attacker, they are much cheaper. Interceptors require little range or payload and so can be much smaller, simpler, and cheaper than bombers or even long-range escort fighters. Surface-to-air missiles are cheaper still. Although the defender can rarely prevent penetration of its air space or inflict decisive losses on individual missions, even moderate losses can accumulate over time to make a protracted air campaign prohibitively expensive for the attacker. The usual standard of prohibitive losses on any single mission is 5 percent. The high loss rates suffered by American day­ light raids over Germany in 1943 (over 10 percent) forced the United States to curtail these operations until long-range fighters became available to es­ cort the bombers in 1944?O To wage a successful coercive air campaign, therefore, the coercer must normally be substantially the stronger military power, because it must achieve air superiority over the disputed territory and still retain sufficient resources for bombing operations. Nuclear bomb­ ing is an exception since individual missions are so destructive that much higher losses can be accepted. In fact, American strategic plans do not call for achieving air superiority before sending in the bombers, and it is not clear that there are plans for multiple missions by each aircraft. Air power offers assailants advantages over either land or sea power. Un­ like land power, it can reach deep into the enemy's homeland from the out­ set of a conflict, and it promises to achieve its effects at sharply lower cost in lives than land power. Unlike sea power, bombing can focus on specific cat­ egories of targets, attacking either political, economic, population, or mili­ tary targets in isolation or combination. Given adequate intelligence, air power can also attack selective target sets
