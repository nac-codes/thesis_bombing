File: --- pape_coercion.pdf --- Page 47 --- Explaining Military Coercion In nuclear coercion, strategic nuclear forces fulfill much the same role as conventional strategic air power, although they are vastly more destruc­ tive, to the point that there are no real limits on their ability to inflict pun­ ishment or to damage an opponent's war economy. Further, when both sides are nuclear armed, both sides will have this capability, in contrast to conventional strategic bombing, which can normally be carried out only by the stronger side. Similarly, tactical nuclear forces can fulfill the same role as theater air power, although again with much greater destructive power. Distinguishing denial and punishment uses is harder, however, since any use of nuclear weapons may generate considerable radioactive fallout. Tactical nuclear weapons may also playa large role in coercive strategies based on risk, since any use of nuclear weapons threatens esca­ lation to strategic nuclear war. In brief, given the limited vulnerability of modern industrial states to naval blockades and the costliness of coercive ground strategies, air power has emerged as the main tool of military coercion. Strategic air power cases are ideally suited for testing theories of military coercion because such cases can isolate the effects of various coercive threats and differences in the target states' vulnerabilities on decisions whether to make concessions. They dif­ ferentiate better than sea, land, or theater air power cases because they in­ clude variation on both independent and dependent variables, whereas the others do not. Given the limited vulnerability of modern industrial states to naval blockades and commerce raiding, coercion with sea power is so in­ effective that these cases inevitably consist mainly of failures. Thus, any sample would have insufficient variation on the dependent variable to dis­ tinguish among a v
