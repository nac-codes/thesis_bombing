rcion with sea power is so in­ effective that these cases inevitably consist mainly of failures. Thus, any sample would have insufficient variation on the dependent variable to dis­ tinguish among a variety of causes. Likewise, land power and theater air power cases have little variation on the independent variable. Since modern ground forces are rarely able to attack economic or military targets without first penetrating enemy lines and achieving decisive victory, coercion with land power must be based mainly on denial rather than punishment or risk. Similarly, theater air power is primarily a denial instrument, usually used together with land power. Inasmuch as these instruments are not used puni­ tively, studying them cannot help discern the relative effectiveness of differ­ ent coercive strategies. Identifying different coercive strategies is also easier in air power cases. This task can sometimes be problematic because assailants often do not ex­ plicitly identify the coercive strategy they are pursuing and because most sea and some land operations have both denial and punitive effects. By con­ trast, in air power cases coercive strategies can nearly always be distin­ guished according to target sets and bombing techniques. Punishment strategies most often employ area bombing of urban centers, whereas denial strategies use precision attacks on industrial, transportation, and military targets.

It also increases the robustness of my findings; even if ambiguity of evidence leaves my interpretation of certain cases
