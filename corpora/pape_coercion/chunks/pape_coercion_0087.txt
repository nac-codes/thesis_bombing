nderstanding concrete air strategies and their application in specific cases, because appropriate oper­ ationalization of all the variables depends on the context of a particular co­ ercive dispute. The two independent variables are civilian vulnerability and military vul­ nerability. Since risk strategies, which affect the probability of costs, are only a weaker version of punishment strategies, which affect the magnitude of costs, I combine them to test for the expectation of suffering due to the co­ ercer's attacks. In terms of the equation R = B p(B) - C p(C), previously dis­ cussed, civilian vulnerability represents the combined effects of C and p(C). Civilian vulnerability, or punishment, is coded as "low," meaning that al­ though there is some risk to individuals, no major part of the population must make adjustments or compromises in daily life to avoid the threat; "medium," meaning that the risks to individuals has risen to the point that major parts of the population must make compromises or adjustments in their daily life, such as evacuation .or substitution, to lower the threat; "high," meaning that 1 percent or more of the population may die despite the best countermeasures; and "very high," meaning that 5 percent or more  File: --- pape_coercion.pdf --- Page 51 --- Explaining Military Coercion of the population is at risk.74 The denial theory expects that coercion should fail in conventional disputes even if civilian vulnerability is high or very high. Military vulnerability, or denial, refers to leaders' expectations of being able to take or hold the disputed territory with military force. In terms of the equation R = B p(B) - C p(C), military vulnerability represents the combined effects of B and p(B). Military vulnerability is coded as "low," meaning that while there is some risk that the current position could not be maintained, it has not reached the point of requiring additional military measures to main­ tain confidence in success; "medium," mea
