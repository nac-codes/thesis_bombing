at while there is some risk that the current position could not be maintained, it has not reached the point of requiring additional military measures to main­ tain confidence in success; "medium," meaning that control over the dis­ puted territory is definitely in jeopardy but the threat can be reduced by added military measures, such as further mobilization of society; "high," meaning that the successful defense or conquest of the territory cannot be assured even with added military measures, but it may be possible to inflict enough attrition to reduce the opponent's commitment to control the terri­ tory; and "very high/ meaning that the likelihood of loss of control over the territory approaches certainty because both defense and heavy attrition of enemy forces are impossible. The denial theory expects coercion to succeed if military vulnerability is high or very high. The key question in assessing the significance of correlations between in­ dependent and dependent measures is how they compare to chance. There are two possible outcomes, success and failure, which are defined as meeting or failing to meet the coercer's demands prior to final defeat. Accordingly, we can easily determine whether the success rate for each theory is the same or higher than would be obtained by simply flipping a coin (see Table 2)?5 The denial theory predicts thirty-seven of forty cases successfully, a result that could be achieved by chance less than once in a thousand times. This is an extremely robust result; for the denial theory to fail the 0.05 standard benchmark significant level it would have to be wrong in more than ten ad­ ditional cases. Such a robust result has the advantage that quibbles over one or a few cases cannot invalidate the theory. Moreover, the results of this analysis demonstrate that military vulnera­ bility, not civilian vulnerability, accounts for most of the variance in the cases. Table 3 shows that achieving high or very high military vulnerability 74 In Si
