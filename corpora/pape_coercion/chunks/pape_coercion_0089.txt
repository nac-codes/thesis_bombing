is demonstrate that military vulnera足 bility, not civilian vulnerability, accounts for most of the variance in the cases. Table 3 shows that achieving high or very high military vulnerability 74 In Singer and Small's study of casualties in modem warfare, 1 percent is half of the av足 erage total losses and 5 percent is near the upper limit of total losses. See The Wages of War, pp. 351-57. In some cases, either civilian or military vulnerability is described as "nil," mean足 ing that there was no current or foreseeable threat, without excluding the possibility that a threat might arise in the future. 75 I justify assuming that the underlying distribution of outcomes is random by the obser足 vation that the distribution of success and failure in the original 33-case universe appears to be random with 14 successes and 19 failures. For a useful methodological guide, see William Gamson and Andre Modigliani, Untangling the Cold War: A Strategy for Testing Rival Theories (Boston: Little, Brown, 1971).
