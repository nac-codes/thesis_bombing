When a coercer pursues a single set of coercive demands through two or more parallel military campaigns, this is still coded as a single case because it still involves a single set of decisions by the target state on whether to concede, regardless of whether only one of the campaigns or both contribute to the decision. Conversely, when independent variables shift during the course of a single cam­ paign these are counted as separate cases because they present the target with different deci­ sions. Accordingly, although the universe of strategic bombing campaigns totals thirty-three disputes, the test of the denial theory recognizes forty distinct cases. For data underlying cod­ ings, see Appendix. Air power alone may not account for the outcome of all the cases, for in many instances, other
