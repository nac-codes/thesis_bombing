. Mechanisms provide the intellectual guidance for opera足 tional air planners who then translate strategy into actual campaigns with the forces at their disposal. This alternative schematic for identifying differ足 ences between coercive air strategies is based on the means-to-ends chain assumed by each, as follows: force ~ targets -~ mechanism ~ political change. Table 4 shows the chains developed by some major theorists. Each of the strategies described in this book depends on assumptions about how destruction of a specific set of targets (unique in each particular case) will trigger a specific mechanism (which is believed to be generally applicable) to produce a concrete policy outcome. MEASURING EFFECTIVENESS The effectiveness of military operations can be measured as either combat effectiveness or strategic effectiveness. Combat effectiveness describes how efficiently a given force destroys a given target set, that is, how well bombs [56]  File: --- pape_coercion.pdf --- Page 57 --- Coercive Air Power Table 4.

As technology improves bombing accuracy, air power necessarily becomes more combat effective, because fewer sorties are neces足 sary to destroy targets. At
