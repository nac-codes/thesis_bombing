--- Bombing to Win along shipping lanes. Thus, since the goal of coercion is political change, my discussion of coercive air strategies focuses on strategic effectivness, not combat effectiveness. COERCIVE AIR STRATEGIES The four main categories of coercive air strategies are punishment, risk, denial, and decapitation. Air superiority is sometimes named as a sepa­ rate air strategy, but it is not. Indeed, all coercive air strategies require command of the air, for aircraft cannot systematically place bombs on any target set if air operations encounter strong opposition from enemy forces. Air superiority need not extend over the enemy's entire territory, but only over the target set the attacker intends to strike and the air corri­ dors to it. The importance of air superiority to coercive air power is illustrated by Germany's attempt to coerce Britain in 1940, which failed because Germany could not achieve command of the air. After the fall of France, the Germans tried to coerce Britain to accept a position of neutrality by threatening an in­ vasion across the English Channel. The Luftwaffe was supposed to playa decisive role in this invasion both by direct support of German ground forces and, even more important, by keeping the Royal Navy, which was far superior to the German surface fleet, from wreaking havoc on German am­ phibious operations. Before the Luftwaffe could carry out these missions, however, it first had to eliminate the capacity of the Royal Air Force to op­ erate over southern England and the English Channel. Accordingly, the Luftwaffe attempted to knock out the main airfields of the RAF in southern England. Initially the campaign achieved considerable success in wearing down British airfields, fighter direction systems, and pilot reserves. Later, however, the Germans shifted their attacks from these weak points in the British air defense system to bombing the city of London, allowing the air defenses to recover. As a result, the Germans never gaine
