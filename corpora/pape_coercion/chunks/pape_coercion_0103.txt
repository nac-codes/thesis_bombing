After the war, Trenchard lost no time in applying this thinking to con­ flict with Britain's most likely continental adversary, France: "I feel that al­ though there would be an outcry, the French in a bombing duel would probably squeal before we did .... The nation that would stand being bombed longest would win in the end." Whether bombing the enemy pop­ ulation would have a long-term material effect on the enemy's industrial ca­ pacity hardly mattered, because air wars were expected to be short and intense. Rather, Trenchard believed that strategic air attack would trigger popular revolts: "The end of war is usually attained when one nation has been able to bring such pressure to bear on another that public opinion obliges the government to sue for peace.,,9 He became famous for arguing that in air wars, the ratio of the "moral effect" on populations to material ef­ fect stood at twenty to one. Additionally, the possibility that the enemy might retaliate made getting in the first blows just that much more critical. National character, not battlefield forces, would determine the outcome of counterpopulation air wars, and in this respect the British were favored over their potential continental adversaries. As one senior British officer noted, "Casualties affected the French more than they did the British. That would have to be taken into consideration too, but the policy of hitting the French nation and making them squeal before we did was a vital one­ more vital than anything else."lo Such notions of the vulnerability
