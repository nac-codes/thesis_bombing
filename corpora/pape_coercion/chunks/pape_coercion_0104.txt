J. F. C. Fuller believed that it was the Jewish element in the East End that had pan­ icked in the bombing of 1917.11 Moreover, based on their fears of how German air attack would compel British surrender, the British seemed to place their own stamp on Douhet's theory by marrying the air scare to the red scare of the 1920S. Air power, ac­ cording to this logic, would bomb industrial centers, creating mass unem­ ployment and panic, especially among the working classes, who in turn would overthrow the government. In short, air attack against populations would cause workers to rise up against the ruling classes.12 Douhet-style thinking had its strongest supporters in Great Britain for several reasons. First, as a result of German bombing of London in 1917, the British public generally supported the idea of an air force designed to pun­ ish an enemy's population centers.
