state would surrender. Like the British and German strategies of economic blockade in World War I, but far more efficiently, the enemy pop­ ulation would be attacked indirectly, as Michael Sherry puts it, "by disrupt­ ing and starving it rather than by blasting and burning."17 Although this strategy contained elements of both punishment and de­ nial, the punitive elements were dominant. Advocates occasionally alluded to how strategic air attack would support a future land invasion, but air of­ ficers built this strategy precisely to avoid depending on land and sea power to achieve political goals in future wars. Because there is some dis­ pute among historians about the essential logic of this strategy, it is useful to quote directly from three ACTS lectures, given to most of the Air Corps "best and brightest" officers, which elucidate the core of the theory.18 The first of these, "The Aim in War", states: "The ultimate object of all mil­ itary operations, then, is to destroy the will of the people at home, for that is the real source of the enemy's national policy .... None of the props which bolster the soldier's morale are present to the same degree to support the will of the civilian. And yet the loss of that morale in the civilian population is far more conclusive than the defeat of the soldier on the battlefield .... Air forces [in contrast to land and sea forces] are capable of immediate em­ ployment toward accomplishing the ultimate aim. They can be used directly to break down the will of the mass of the enemy people.,,19 The second lecture explains how to achieve this aim by attacking an enemy's national economic structure. "Modem warfare places an enormous load upon the economic system of a nation, which increases its sensitivity to attack man­ ifold. Certainly a breakdown in any part of this complex interlocked organiza­ tion must seriously influence the conduct of war by that nation, and greatly interfere with the social welfare and morale of its nationa
