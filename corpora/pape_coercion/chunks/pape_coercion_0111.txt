enemy's civilian population at the beginning of a war would ef­ fectively destroy the enemy's will to resist, producing a far cheaper victory than the Army could achieve. The choice of the industrial web approach rather than Douhet-style area bombing also helped the Air Corps in a separate resource competition with the Navy. The United States was so geographically isolated from European centers of power that American leaders believed their cities were immune from enemy bombing and that the principal threat would come across the seas. Accordingly, to win resources, proponents of air power had to argue not for the preemptive strike on enemy cities favored in Britain but that air­ craft could destroy approaching ships more effectively than the Navy. Since coastal defense required precision bombing, it made sense for the Air Corps to adopt a precision-based rather than area attack approach to strategic bombing. In short, the complementarity of precision attack on the industrial web and and precision bombing of ships at sea satisfied the Air Corp's twin needs for a "strategic" function to gain independence from the Army and for tactical superiority against enemy ships to win resources from the Navy.25 U.S. air doctrine was also shaped by the liberal tradition in American pol­ itics and by economic conditions during the Great Depression.
