rce (Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala.: Air Uni­ versity Press, 1989). 25 Both arguments are reflected in Mitchell's writings. If anything, he is more enthusiastic about the capabilities of aviation against ships than against any other kind of target. See, for example, William Mitchell, "Air Power vs. Sea Power," American Review of Reviews 58 (March 1921): 273-77. For an example of Mitchell's argument in favor of bombing cities, see Winged Defense (New York: Putnam's, 1925), pp. 126-27.

By the mid-1930S, air planners ceased to favor direct at­ tacks on civilian populations, although such attacks were never excluded as an option for the later stages of an air offensive. Attacking the enemy's will through the more humane and economical method of selective attack made sense in the 1930S because the total budgets of the Army, of which the Air Corps was a part, were in decline. Accordingly, the Air Corps required a doctrine that promised victory not only at less cost relative to the Army and Navy but cheaply in absolute terms. Greater financial scarcity also made it impolitic to affront American liberal values by advocating the mass slaugh­ ter of civilians. Thus, unlike Mitchell, who assumed that strategic air power would wipe away cities, Generals Ira C. Eaker and H. H. Arnold wrote in 1941: "Human beings are not priority targets except in special situations. Bombers in far larger numbers than are available today will be required for wiping out people in sufficient numbers by aerial bombardment to break the will of a whole nation."26 Thomas Schelling and the Manipulation of Risk In the two decades after World War II, social scientists devoted consider­ able attention to the problem of military coercion.
