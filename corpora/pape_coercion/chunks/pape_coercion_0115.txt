at targets will in fact be destroyed. Under this strategy, bombing is gradu­ ally escalated in intensity, geographical extent, or both. For example, a Schelling campaign might destroy targets in a sequence from demonstration targets to military targets to economic targets to populatjon centers. The co­ ercer must signal clearly that the bombing is contingent on the opponent's behavior and will be stopped upon compliance with the coercer's de­ mands. "The ideal compellent action," Schelling writes, "would be one that, once initiated, causes minimal harm if compliance is forthcoming, and great harm if compliance is not forthcoming, is consistent with the time schedule of feasible compliance, is beyond recall once initiated, and cannot be stopped by the party that started it but automatically stops upon compliance, with all this fully understood by the adversary."3o Public and International Affairs, Princeton University, 1959); J.

The Johnson adminstration felt constrained to limit bombing of North Vietnam, both because important sectors of the American public would not support indiscriminate bombing and, even more impor­ tant, because officials feared that massive bombing throughout North
