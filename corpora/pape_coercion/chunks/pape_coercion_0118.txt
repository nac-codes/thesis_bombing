quate food, lack of transportation, poor sanitary facilities, and the break­ down of public utilities and services (gas, wate~ electricity, heat supply, etc.) produce less effect on civilians than direct attack. Although emotional stress increases with the amount of deprivation, the changes in morale are not as great as with personal exposure to bombing.32 Denial: Attacking the Enemy's Military Strategy Using air power for denial entails smashing enemy military forces, weak­ ening them to the point where friendly ground forces can seize disputed ter­ ritories without suffering unacceptable losses. Denial strategies seek to thwart the enemy's military strategy for taking or holding its territorial ob­ jectives, compelling concessions to avoid futile expenditure of further re­ sources. Accordingly, denial campaigns generally center on destruction of arms manufacturing, interdiction of supplies from homefront to battlefront, disruption of movement and communication in the theater, and attrition of fielded forces. Coercive air strategies based on denying the enemy victory on the battle­ field developed without the benefit of an air theorist to organize the ideas into a coherent set of principles, though John C. Slessor, a British airman who wrote in the 1930s, came the closest. Concerned that the Germans might capture the Low Countries, from which the Luftwaffe could attack British economic and political centers, he stressed the importance of attack- 32 James M.

Titmuss, Problems of Social Policy (London: HMSO, 1950); and Max Seydewitz, Civil Life in Wartime Germany (New York: Viking, 1945). Although bombing in Germany caused water shortages and widespread pollution of the water supply, it did not significantly reduce public health because personal health habits, medical services, and gov­ ernment emergency measures controlled the spread of disease.
