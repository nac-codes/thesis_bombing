Therefore, they looked instead for components early in the military production cycle, the destruc­ tion of which would make the large-scale manufacture of heavy military equipment such as tanks, aircraft, and artillery impossible: "It is better to cause a high degree of destruction in a few really essential industries or services than to cause a small degree of destruction in many industries."37 Consequently, their targets for strategic interdiction were special primary and semifinished products such as ball bearings, machine tools, rubber, aluminum, magnesium, nickel, steel, and nitrates that are used in the as­ sembly of finished military goods. Even after the experience of World War II, many civilian students of strategic bombing have advocated critical component theories.38 Another form of strategic interdiction is a "systemwide" strategy that seeks to stop flows of resources and manufacturing by attacking all parts of very large systems rather than selecting critical components within systems. This strategy also emerged from World War II, deriving mainly from opera­ tions against Japanese sea commerce and the German national railway. Transportation is an effective target set for this purpose because it is large and connects primary goods to industries and industries to each other. Since the purpose is to attack the movement of resources and goods at all stages of the production cycle (raw materials to heavy industry to intermediate in­ dustries to finished products), air attacks are directed not only against key nodes such as marshalling yards, bridges, and ports but also against mov­ ing traffic, rolling stock, and cargo vessels. In contrast to attacks on critical components this form of strategk interdiction applies pressu
