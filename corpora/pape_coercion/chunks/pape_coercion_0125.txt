port the ground offensive. It was necessary to shift away from both Douhet and strategic interdiction because these would require an un­ certainly long period to translate damage inflicted on specific targets to measurable weakening of German resistance. The pressure to reduce Allied ground casualties compelled development of a strategy designed to dimin­ ish German ground force mobility and fighting capacity in the western the­ ater with effects that Allied ground forces could immediately exploit to their advantage. Emphasis on operational paralysis led to the development of two sets of plans. The British plan aimed to destroy the rail, road, and river communi­ cations on which the German army depended in the theater. The core target set was the French railway network, because it carried the vast majority of very heavy loads, including military vehicles and other heavy equipment.4o Railroad marshaling yards and bridges were struck, virtually shutting down rail movement west of Paris. Since reinforcing divisions had to march by road from Paris to Normandy, it took those that came from Poland as long to move the last two hundred miles by road as it had taken to move the first thirteen hundred miles by train.41 In contrast, American air planners selected oil instead of transportation. Believing that German-controlled railroads had too great a cushion of ca­ pacity for civilian and long-term industrial use above the minimum re­ quired by fighting units, the U.S. Enemy Objectives Unit maintained that a determined effort against oil would quickly reduce German military capa­ bilities by reducing tactical and strategic mobility and frontline delivery of supplies.42 Both the British and the American plans were executed, and de­ bate continues over which contributed more to the war's outcome.43 This focus on affecting the fighting effectiveness of the German army also caused tactical air doctrine to evolve along similar lines. Until 1944, tactical air forces were largely se
