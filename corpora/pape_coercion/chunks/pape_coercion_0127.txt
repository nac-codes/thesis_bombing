interdiction" campaign was not so much to destroy reserve units deep behind the front as to prevent them from being moved to reinforce the front. Disrupting com­ munications would keep theater commanders ignorant of the true situation of units; attacking headquarters would impair the ability of staffs to coordi­ nate units; and bombing logistic networks would reduce the mobility and firepower of German forces.44 The campaign succeeded, as Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, the German commander reponsible for defending the French coast, noted: "The movement of our troops on the battlefield is al­ most completely paralyzed, while the enemy can maneuver freely."45 Thus, by the end of World War II, a complete set of denial strategies-from attri­ tion of ground units to operational and strategic interdiction-had been de­ veloped. In general, denial air strategies are more likely to succeed against con­ ventional forces than against guerrillas. The inelastic dependence of mecha­ nized forces on logistics and central control means that shortages can undermine the ability of organized units to take or hold the disputed terri­ tory, and the complexity of conventional war planning means that these can be anticipated in advance. In contrast, guerrilla wars depend on the will­ ingness of overlapping small groups to continue to resist central authorities, and this type of collective action is both less sensitive to shortages and less predictable. Guerrillas should be largely immune to coercion; coercers should expect to pay the full costs of military success to extract political con­ cessions. American coercion of North Vietnam in 1965 to 1968 failed because U.S. bombing could not address any important vulnerability of Hanoi's guerilla strategy. During this period, the United States tried to undermine the North's strategy for unifying Vietnam by interdicting the flow of logistics from Hanoi to Communist forces in the South.
