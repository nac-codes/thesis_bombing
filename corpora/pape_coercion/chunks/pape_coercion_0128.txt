to undermine the North's strategy for unifying Vietnam by interdicting the flow of logistics from Hanoi to Communist forces in the South. Although considerable dam­ age was inflicted on the enemy logistic system, this had little effect on the feasibility of Hanoi's military strategy because the guerrilla campaign being fought in this period required little in the way of supplies and next to noth­ ing at all from North Vietnam. Even with well over 200,000 troops in the field, their requirements for food, ammunition, medical supplies, and POL never exceeded roughly 380 tons a day, of which only some 34 tons came from the North. Given these tiny supply requirements, aerial bombardment 44 Alfred Price, Instruments of Darkness: The History of Electronic Warfare (London: Macdon­ ald and Jane's, 1977), pp. 97-250. 45 B. H.

If denial is more likely to succeed against conventional than against guer­ rilla strategies, when are the three forms of denial-strategic interdiction, operational interdiction, and attrition of military forces-most effective? The purpose of strategic interdiction, which destroys production of mili­ tary equipment and national transportation networks, is to reduce available quantities of weapons, munitions, and other military supplies. Strategic in­ terdiction is an effective denial strategy only in protracted wars of attrition, and even then may require the attacker to pay heavy costs before coercive success is achieved. In short wars, attacking economic targets rarely affects battlefield ca­ pabilities. The long lead times of production and conversion of civilian to military manufacturing means that industry can hardly contribute to wars lasting less than six months or a year. Accordingly, demolishing weapons plants, and even the
