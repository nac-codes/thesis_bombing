the Iraqis also appear to have dispersed much of the equipment for their national telecommunica­ tions network and other key industrial systems prior to the start of the air war to enable the rapid restoration of these systems after the war.48 Strategic interdiction is most effective when attacks are against the econ­ omy as a whole. The most effective plan is to destroy the transportation net­ work that brings raw materials and primary goods to manufacturing centers and often redistributes subcomponents among various industries. Attacking national electric power grids is not effective because industrial fa­ cilities commonly have their own backup power generation. Attacking na­ tional oil refineries to reduce backup power generators typically ignores the ability of states to reduce consumption through conservation and rationing. Against an exceptionally import-dependent economy, such as Japan in World War II, disruption of transportation can best be accomplished by blockading sea routes, using air power less for bombing than. for shipping attack and mining. If imports can be totally cut off, the target economy will collapse when domestic stockpiles are exhausted; the Japanese. merchant marine was essentially destroyed by the end of 1944, leading to collapse of war production by the middle of 1945. Against a relatively resource-rich economy, such as Nazi-controlled Europe, strategic interdiction requires stopping the flow of commerce along domestic railroad, highway, and canal 48 See the remarks by William Arkin in "Defeat of Iraq Sparks Debate on Which Air Role Was Crucial," Aviation Week and Space Technology, 27 January 1992, pp. 62~3.

This mis­ sion is hard because commercial transportation systems are large and redundant and are rarely used to full capacity.
