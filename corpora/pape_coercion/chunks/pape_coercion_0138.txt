As a punishment strategy, it aims to overcome a key weak­ ness in such strategies: the increased ability of governments to repress dis­ sent in war. As a denial strategy, it aims to extend the logic of operational paralysis to "strategic" or national decision makers. Although there have been sporadic efforts to attack leaders or their na­ tional communications, only recently has this strategy became the corner­ stone of air campaigns. Government buildings were bombed in Berlin and Pyongang and Hanoi's radio station was attacked, but the inaccuracy of bombing limited the ability of air strikes to destroy targets. With the Libya raid, however, which just missed Moamar Qaddafi, and the inclusion of Sad dam Hussein's palaces and command bunkers on Desert Storm's target lists, decapitation is gaining attention.50 The main attraction of targeting po­ liticalleadership with conventional weapons is that it offers the possibility of successful coercion with minimal commitment of resources and risk of life, and it can be justified on the grounds that national command and con­ trol should be a legitimate target in conventional war, just as political lead­ ership became a legitimate nuclear target in the 1970s. Political leadership targeting is not likely to produce coercive leverage, however, for three reasons. First, it is very hard to find individuals and kill them.

The outbreak of war is generally accompanied by the tightening of security measures throughout society, especially those de- 50 Ross, "Case for Targeting Leadership."
