pinion. In authoritar­ ian states, successions are even more uncertain because lieutenants com­ monly mute their voices and opinions, making it particularly difficult to know the political power they would have in a succession crisis or the direc­ tion in which they would move the country once in power. Efforts to predict the Soviet leadership succession in the late 1970S are an important case in point. Brezhnev's actual successor, Yuri Andropov, and his successor, Kon­ stantin Chernenko, and his successor, Mikhail Gorbachev, are hardly men­ tioned, let alone predicted as future rulers, by the most detailed treatment at the time.55 Similarly, few would have known that Saddam Hussein was the strong man in Baghdad before he replaced Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr in 1979. Another variant on decapitation is to use air power to create the circum­ stances in which local groups overthrow the government, either by popular revolt or a coup, replacing it with one more amenable to concessions. De­ capitation, however, has never toppled a government. The only attempt to execute such a strategy occurred during the air campaign against Iraq, in which some air planners hoped that strikes against Baghdad would weaken Saddam's political control and permit the overthrow of his government. 56 Nonetheless, after the most ambitious decapitation air campaign in history, in which over 44 leadership and 156 command-and-control facilities were attacked, and despite the fact that Iraq, with a long history of coups and an unpopular leader, was an ideal case for this strategy, Sad dam did not fall. Decapitation, like punishment, is not likely to topple governments, by fo­ menting either popular rebellion or a coup. Air attack is a weak instrument for producing popular rebellions, mainly because conflict with a foreign power typically unleashes political forces (such as nationalism and fear of treasonous behavior) which make collective action against even unpopular regimes unlikely until the opportunity
