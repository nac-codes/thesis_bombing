ational enmity makes foreign co­ operation with the indigenous military difficult before the coup and pro­ vokes resistance to the insurgents by the people and army during it, which is why the Iranian-backed coup in Iraq (1970) and the Libyan-backed coup in the Sudan (1976) failed. Indeed, unless foreign ground troops are committed, the key predictor of the success of a foreign-backed coup is the degree of po- 57 Some of the standard works on coups are Samuel E. Finer, The Man on Horseback: The Role of the Military in Politics (New York: Praeger, 1962); Eric A. Nordlinger, Soldiers in Politics: Mili­ tary Coups and Governments (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1977); Samuel P. Hunting­ ton, Political Order in Changing Societies (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1968); and Amos Perlmutter, The Military and Politics in Modern Times (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1977). 58 For the mechanics of coup operations, see Edward Luttwak, Coup d'Etat: A Practical Handbook (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1979); and Gregor Ferguson, Coup d'Etat: A Practical Manual (Dorset, England: Arms and Armour Press, 1987).

If the survival of the targeted regime already depends on the outside power backing the coup, as in the case of the United States in South Vietnam (1963-1965) or the French in the Central African Republic (1981), the chances of success are high. If the foreign power's influence is weak compared to the indigenous political base of the existing regime, as with the Soviet Union in the Sudan (1971), the chances of success are low. 59 In theory, the growing centralization of military operations could mean that attacks against the most senior military commanders and their com­ munication links to the theater could paralyze military forces. If the leaders cannot communicate with theater commanders, they cannot coordinate any meaningful
