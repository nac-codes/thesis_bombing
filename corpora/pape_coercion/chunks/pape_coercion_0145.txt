ior military commanders and their com­ munication links to the theater could paralyze military forces. If the leaders cannot communicate with theater commanders, they cannot coordinate any meaningful national strategy, nor can they adjust strategy to meet enemy moves. In short, if attacking military headquarters in the theater causes op­ erational paralysis, then attacking national military headquarters should be even better because it causes "strategic" paralysis.60 Strategic paralysis is virtually impossible to achieve, however, for three rea­ sons. First, strategic direction does not demand high-volume real-time com­ munication. The sheer size, spatial dispersion, and complexity of modem forces makes it impossible for national leaders to direct units in battle. The complexity and speed of modem operations means that the flow of informa­ tion to and from units cannot be sufficiently detailed or arrive sufficiently fast to allow close control by a commander sitting at the seat of government, mod­ em communications notwithstanding; control over actual combat must be ex­ erted in the theater.61 Lyndon Johnson did involve himself in picking air targets for strategic bombing (a type of operation more easily centrally planned than most), but he could not and did not get involved in the enor­ mous number of decisions required for day-to-day management of land, tac­ tical air, and naval operations. National leaders generally give theater-wide direction (choosing when and where the main effort is to be applied), some­ times authorize operational plans prepared by lower echelons to implement these broad decisions, and only sporadically intervene in decisions about how to coordinate forces, and then on an ad hoc basis. Characterizations of mili­ tary command and control systems as centralized and decentralized can be misleading. These terms generally relate to the discretion given tactical unit commanders (e.g., divisions and brigades) by theater commanders (e.g., corps and
