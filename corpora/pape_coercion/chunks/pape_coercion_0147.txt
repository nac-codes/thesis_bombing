sily repaired because breaking strategic communication does not cause the same traffic jams that breaking intratheater communication does. Because theater warfare is analo­ gous to railroad management-that is, it must dispatch large loads along a limited number of high-capacity routes on a tight schedule-traffic jams make it necessary to plan new routing, and therefore they have major and long-last­ ing effects. Strategic direction is more like a car trip. If the car does not start, one can borrow or rent another; if the road is closed or there are traffic jams, one can take a different route; if the weather is bad, one can go another day. Third, theater commanders frequently are predelegated to act without higher authorization in emergencies. Although the normal practice in the United States is for unified commanders to seek authorization from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to implement measures beyond basic peacetime routines, the unified commanders have discretionary power to take whatever measures they consider necessary to preserve the security of the forces under their command, including moving them to locations anywhere in their area of re­ sponsibility. Delegation of authority occurs even in authoritarian regimes. In principle, the tendency of authoritarian leaders to limit decision making to a very few and to avoid predelegation of authority could make them more vulnerable to strategic paralysis. In practice, however, centralization is limited by the extreme complexity of modem military operations. Even if they would like to, central authorities cannot micromanage all the command and logistic co­ ordination that occurs in the theater. Militaries of authoritarian regimes often do perform poorly, but for a different reason. Such regimes often select and train officers primarily for political loyalty, not military skill. Thus, their most important battlefield weakness is simply poor generalship, not exces­ sive dependence on strategic communications. 62 Martin Van
