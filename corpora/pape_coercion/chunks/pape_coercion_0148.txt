primarily for political loyalty, not military skill. Thus, their most important battlefield weakness is simply poor generalship, not exces­ sive dependence on strategic communications. 62 Martin Van Creveld, Command in War (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1985); Paul Stares, Command Performance (Washington, D.C.: Brookings, 1991), pp. 112-13.

Stalin formed his own supreme command body, called the Stavka, which in prin­ ciple had the authority to intervene in local decisions anywhere. In practice, however, its members recognized that, being in the rear, they could not ob­ tain enough timely information for detailed operational direction to be use­ ful in many circumstances. As a result, the Stavka developed a procedure to exert close control over a local battle by sending a member with plentipo­ tentiary authority to the front to issue orders to local commanders in the name of the Stavka. For instance, when Stalin could not obtain information about the course of the battle for Moscow in September 1941, he sent Mar­ shal Georgi K. Zhukov to the front, not only to collect information but also to issue orders on the spot. 63 STRATEGIES AND CASES All the coercive air strategies I have described were used in one or more of the case
