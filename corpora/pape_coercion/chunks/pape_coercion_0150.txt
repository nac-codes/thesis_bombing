ugees, and the continuing operation of the "final so­ lution."l From the standpoint of coercion, what matters is why Germany did not surrender even though the Allies had both inflicted tremendous punish­ ment and undermined its military capacity to resist. During the war, the Al­ lies dropped 1.3 million tons of bombs on Germany, destroying over 40 percent of the urban area of the seventy largest cities and killing 305,000 1 U.s.

Thus, both punishment- and denial-based theories would have predicted success. Compared to Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, the German case has generated relatively little scholarly debate. The conventional wisdom is that Hitler's absolute power and ideological fanaticism prevented any possibility of sur­ render. The wider implications for coercion are generally ignored. Hitler's rule is considered so exceptional that broader theories of foreign policy de­ cision making neither can nor should be expected to account for Germany's behavior.3 This argument is misleading, however. In fact, Hitler's power was not ab­ solute. German decision making was not different in kind from that of all other possible targets of coercion, only in degree. Modern nation-states
