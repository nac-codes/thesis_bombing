render did not occur, because continued resistance was expected to mitigate the civilian costs of eventual defeat. At this point, although further resistance could not avoid defeat and would involve additional costs, Ger­ man leaders believed that it would avoid even greater civilian costs inflicted by a vengeful Russian army. They hoped to buy time for refugees and sol­ diers to escape from the areas to be occupied by Russia into areas under the control of the Western Allies. The failure of Germany to surrender emphasizes the importance of the re­ lation between the costs of surrender and the costs of resistance. Leaders abandon territorial objectives only when the costs of continued resistance exceed the expected benefits of further fighting. Because of the refugee problem in the east, Germans believed in spring 1945 that surrender would increase, not decrease, civilian costs. Thus, although Germany's failure to surrender is inconsistent with the most parsimonious version of my theory (which simply predicts that military vulnerability will coerce although civilian vulnerability will not), on closer inspection it is consistent with the underlying causal logic of the theory.4 To understand why Germany failed to surrender, we must examine Al­ lied goals and strategies, how faithfully and capably they were executed, and the links among Allied military pressure, the prospects for Germany's diplomatic and military strategies, and changes in German leaders' willing­ ness to surrender. 4 We could represent the effects of costs of surrender on the decision making of target states by adding two terms to the equation presented in Chapter 2 as follows: R = Bp(B) -Cp(C) + C(s) pC(s). Note that such "costs of surrender" must be separate from the loss of the territor­ ial values at stake, which are already accounted for as B.
