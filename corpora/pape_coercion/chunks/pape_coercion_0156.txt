portant in 1943 because although battlefield events were changing in favor of the Allies, victory was not yet in sight and the costs of achieving it were certain to be high.8 During the war, Allied military and civilian leaders conceived four strategies to finish Germq.ny, all of which depended heavily on strategic air power. The first was the "industrial web" strategy, which would use precision attacks on key economic bottlenecks to cripple the German economy as a whole, fatally weakening the social and political cohesion needed for resistance. The second, strategic air interdiction, would also use precision bombing but would focus on industries critical to war pro­ duction rather than seek a general economic collapse. The third was a Douhet strategy using area incendiary bombing of population centers. All three approaches aimed to break German resistance through air power alone, so that a cross-Channel invasion would be either unnecessary or simply a coup de grace to an already beaten opponent.9 The fourth strat­ egy, by contrast, aimed to destroy the German army through the com­ bined weight of Soviet and Western ground offensives. Strategic air power would support this strategy through operational interdiction at­ tacks designed to have a direct and immediate impact on ground opera­ tions. Support for these strategies fluctuated, mainly according to views on the necessity for, and scale and timing of, an Anglo-American landing on the Continent to roll back the Wehrmacht from Western Europe. To assess the ef­ fects of the Allies' military strategies on German political calculations, we must investigate the advocates, goals, targets, and plans of each. Destruction of Economic Bottlenecks American airmen entered World War II believing that Germany could be forced to surrender by air bombardment of industry, without invading the Continent or resorting to terror bombing of civilians. The initial plans fol­ lowed the 1930S "industrial web" theory, which predicted that
