The initial plans fol­ lowed the 1930S "industrial web" theory, which predicted that small amounts of destruction, if concentrated on weak nodes critical to the system as a whole, would bring the whole economic house of cards down.

The hope was that these efforts would be so suc­ cessful that they alone might'induce Germany to sue for peace. The role of the British army would thus be limited to occupation instead of invasion, avoiding the horrors of land combat ala World War I.

For ev­ idence that the British based early planning with the United States on hopes for victory through air and naval coercion, see Wesley Frank Craven and James Lea Cate, The Army Air Forces in World War II (Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1948), 1: 142-43.

The chief motive behind this strategy was to force Germany to capitulate at minimum cost to American and British land forces regardless of the outcome of Germany's war with the Soviet Union. The industrial web theory was embodied in the first Air War Planning Document (AWPD-1), of 1941, which proposed destroying some common servicing system on which all major German industrial sectors depended instead of hitting isolated industrial plants.lO War demands required 17 mil­ lion Germans to move out of civilian pursuits and production and into mil­ itary-related
