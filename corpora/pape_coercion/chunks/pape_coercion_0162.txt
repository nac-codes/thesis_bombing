bare the assumed effects of dropping 1.250 million tons of bombs on German towns: (i) the destruction of 6,000,000 German dwellings, with a proportionate de­ struction of industrial buildings, sources of power, means of transportation and public utilities; (ii) 25,000,000 Germans rendered homeless; (iii) an additional 60,000,000 "incidents" of bomb damage to houses; (iv) civilian casualties estimated at about 900,000 killed and 1,000,000 seri­ ously injured.I7 14 In the months prior to the German attack on France, the British Air Staff produced three plans: W.A. 5, which sought to cripple German war industry in the Ruhr, Rhineland, and Saar by destroying electric power, gas and coking plants, and the railway system; W.A. 6, which focused exclusively on oil production; and w.A. 8, which aimed to attack morale by targeting the electricity, gas, and oil plants mentioned in W.A.5 and W.A.6 at night.

This view was supported by civilian advocates, such as Lord Cherwell, the prime minister's scientific adviser, who said in March 1942: "Investigation seems to show that having one's house demolished is most damaging to morale. People seem to mind it more than having their friends or even relatives killed. At Hull signs of strain were evident, though only one-tenth of the houses were d
