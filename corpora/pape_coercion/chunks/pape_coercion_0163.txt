demolished is most damaging to morale. People seem to mind it more than having their friends or even relatives killed. At Hull signs of strain were evident, though only one-tenth of the houses were de­ molished .... we should be able to do ten times as much harm to each of the fifty-eight prin­ cipal German towns. There seems little doubt that this would break the spirit of the people." Quoted in ibid. 17 Ibid., pp. 10-11. Similarly, a 30 March 1942,paper by Lord Cherwell to the Cabinet ex­ pected that "if even half of the total load of 10,000 bombers were dropped on the built-up area of these 58 towns, the great majority of their inhabitants (about one-third of the Ger­ man population) would be turned out of house and home."

Destroying homes would depress morale to the point at which the population would abandon economic activity. The German state would then face a terrible dilemma between achieving its ter­ ritorial goals and continuing to provide for its population: "A substantial proportion of the total industry of Germany is necessary to maintain a min­ imum standard of subsistence amongst the German people. As the German economic structure is now stretched to the limit this proportion cannot be further reduced. Consequently, the loss of one-third of German industry would involve the sacrifice of almost the entire war potential of Germany in an effort to maintain the internal economy of the country or else the collapse of the latter."ls According to this logic, destroying homes lowers civilian morale, which diminishes all economic production, which compels a choice between achieving territorial objectives or civil unrest.19 American airmen also became attracted to the idea of bombing civil
