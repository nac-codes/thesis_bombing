From the beginning American air planning considered that in addition to hitting economic bottlenecks, the air offensive might end with final attacks on urban areas. AWPD-1 emphasized that "timeliness of attack is most important in the conduct of air operations directly against civil morale. If the morale of the people is already low be­ cause of sustained suffering and deprivation and because the people are los­ ing faith in the ability of the armed forces to win a favorable decision, then heavy and sustained bombing of cities may crush that morale entirely." Sim­ ilarly, "immediately after some very apparent results of air attack on the ma­ terial objectives listed above or immediately after some set-back of the German ground forces, it may become highly profitable to deliver a large scale, all-out attack on the civil population of Berlin. In this event, any or all the bombardment forces may be diverted for this mission."2o Strategic Interdiction By the time the United States deployed a significant bombing force in early 1943, American air strategy had shifted from the industrial web theory 18 Portal quoted in Towns Panel, Effects on German Towns, pp. 10-11. 19 Evidence that British civilians held up well under air attack was discounted because Ger­ mans were considered especially vulnerable to morale bombing. One report declared: "The Germans have been undernourished and subjected to a permanent strain equivalent to that of war conditions during almost the whole period of Hitler's regime, and for this reason also will be liable to crack before a nation of greater stamina [i.e., Britain].
