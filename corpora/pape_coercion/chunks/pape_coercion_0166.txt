chine tools, rubber, aluminum, magnesium, nickel, steel, and nitrates. Although early American war plans focused on industrial-web targets such as electric power and transportation, as the war progressed, commit­ tees were established to study the German economy in detail. These panels, comprising economists, political scientists, and experts in industrial man­ agement, as well as air men, quickly realized that earlier plans failed to rec­ ognize the possibility of substitution.22 It was not enough to establish how much of a commodity was needed and to reduce production below that level, for other means of production or other products could often be sub­ stituted, especially if the defender possessed stockpiles and the ability to re­ pair damaged factories. Further, dual-use commodities, such as oil, could be taken from the civilian sectors of the economy so that the combat power of German forces would not be reduced until the civilian cushion had been de­ stroyed. The net effect of this analysis was the replacement of electric power and transportation with ball bearings as the primary target. What had been the 21 Some histories and some participants have lumped together the strategies I differentiate as strategic interdiction, operational interdiction, and the industrial web theory, including the official histories of Craven and Cate and Webster and Frankland. My framework not only captures fundamental differences among the air strategies but also explains why certain tar­ gets, such as electric power, which were considered critical early in the war and which the United States Strategic Bombing Survey says could have been struck later, were completely abandoned. By the time it had become feasible to strike these targets they were no longer con­ sidered desirable because a fundamentally different strategy guided target selection. 22 Craven and Cate, Army Air Forces in World War II 2: 351-52.
