e a fundamentally different strategy guided target selection. 22 Craven and Cate, Army Air Forces in World War II 2: 351-52.

So long as capacity could be shifted to re­ place what was lost at anyone point (current in the case of power and rail cars in the case of transportation), many nodes would have to be struck simulta­ neously to affect the system. The targets were too numerous and dispersed to be struck at the same time with available aircraft.23 Ball bearings emerged as the main industrial target because the 5chweinfurt plants alone manufactured one-half of the total Axis production, thus offering a peculiarly concentrated target within practicable flying range. Bearings were thought to be in such short supply (the inventory cushion was estimated to be only one month's supply) that any curtailment of production would be felt almost immediately. If the planned attacks were successful, the resulting shortages were expected to reduce German armaments production by 30 percent.24 The shift in targeting philosophy can be traced by comparing the target priorities of the original AWPD-1 to those of AWPD-2 (August 1942) and to the Combined Bomber Offensive (May 1943). All three list the German air force as a preliminary objective, but electric power is progressively down­ graded from second in AWPD-1 to fourth in AWPD-2 and disappears alto­ gether in the CBO plan (see Table 20). "Morale" appeared only in AWPD-1; AWPD-2 retained transportation and oil and added submarine yards and rubber; the CBO plan added ball bearings and military vehicles to the list.25 Invasion and Operational Interdiction The first three strategies-the industrial web, Douhet, and strategic inter­ diction-were intended primarily for coercive purposes.
