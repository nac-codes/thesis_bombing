In the first stage, starting in May 1940, the RAF launched an operational interdiction cam­ paign, but without sufficient resources to be effective. In the second, which began in March 1942, the RAF undertook Douhet-style bombing of cities. In the third stage, beginning in May 1943, the British continued their Douhet campaign, while the Americans pursued a strategic interdiction strategy based on precision bombing of industrial targets. In the final stage, starting in May 1944, strategic bombing was supplemented with an invasion threat from both the west and the east. In the air, the British persisted in pounding German cities, while the Americans employed a mix composed primarily of operational interdiction, lesser effort on strategic interdiction, and some morale bombing at the very end (see Table 21). British Operational Interdiction Although the British favored attacks on German cities, they were initially unable to pursue such a strategy for two reasons. First, they were deterred. During the 1930S, British political and military leaders feared that in future wars the Luftwaffe would deliver an early "knock-out" blow by bombing British cities, and this fear was sharpened by the German bombing of War­ saw in 1939 and Rotterdam in 1940. Since the Luftwaffe enjoyed numerical superiority, Britain decided to conserve resources until the gap in air strength was narrowed. 32 Second, the British were often distracted by im­ mediate operational needs.
