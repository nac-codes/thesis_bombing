d numerical superiority, Britain decided to conserve resources until the gap in air strength was narrowed. 32 Second, the British were often distracted by im足 mediate operational needs. The German attack on France and subsequent threat to the British Isles made reduction of German fielded military strength the dominant concern. Accordingly, from May 1940 through July 1941, Bomber Command waged an operational interdiction campaign.33 During the Battle of France, bombing was directed against oil plants and marshalling yards in the Ruhr and Ger足 man forces in France. Once France fell and it became clear that a German in足 vasion of England would require the Luftwaffe to establish air superiority over Britain, Bomber Command turned its attention to reducing the German air threat by attacking aluminum plants, airframe assembly factories, and air stores parks in Germany, as well as German ports and shipping useful in the 32 Wesley K.

Blockade of foodstuffs would produce widespread starvation throughout Europe, and air attack, especially against oil, would weaken German military control by immobilizing its forces. J. R. M.
