oint that only one-third of the bombs fell within five miles of the target area.35 More important, any damage inflicted by bombing the primary resources of oil and transportation could contribute little to reducing Germany's fighting capacity, for oil was relatively abundant and most of the Reich's transportation could not be reached. Germany's conquests in 1940 and 1941 opened the door 34 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive 1: 146-47, 156,256,302. 35 This was the conclusion of the famous Butt report of August 1942, which was the first systematic use of photographic reconnaissance to assess bomb damage.

Consequently, Ger­ many was considerably less dependent on indigenous oil installations than it had been before the war. Destroying transportation targets that could be reached was also futile, because only those in the Ruhr could be bombed. Even if all nine of the designated railway centers in this area had been hit with the fifteen tons thought necessary to disrupt operations for a week, repairs could have been so easily accomplished during this period that no disruption of traf­ fic large enough to affect the German economy would have occurred.36 Douhet, March 1942-1945 Early in 1942, the British strategic bombing effort shifted from an opera­ tional interdiction strategy to a Douhet strategy of inflicting maximum dam­ age on population centers.37 Attacks against population centers remained the main focus of RAF bombing for the rest of the war, although in 1944 and 1945 some effort was diverted to operational interdiction in support of the West­ ern Front and to suppress V-weapons sites.38 The change in British air strategy resulted from three factors. First, after German air raids on London and other English cities in 1940, the
