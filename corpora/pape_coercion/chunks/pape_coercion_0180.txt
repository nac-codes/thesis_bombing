owards accentuating this condition."43 Following Thun­ derclap, a few additional American incendiary raids were launched, against Dresden {14 February}, Munich (25 February), Berlin (26 February), Leipzig (27 February), Halle (27 February) and Chemnitz (3 March) before strategic bombing operations were stood down in April 1945.44 The overall pace of the city-bombing campaign can be gauged by the rate at which urban area was destroyed in the fifty-eight principal population centers. Up until February 1942 practically no built-up area in these cities had been destroyed. By June 1943 fourteen square miles had been burned out, by March 1944 thirty-six square miles, and by March 1945 sixty-seven square miles, after which no further damage was recorded. 45 In all, Allied bombers attacked sixty-one major cities and thirty-one towns, of which 128 square miles were razed, amounting to 50 percent of their urban area.

Army Air Forces and the Bombing of Berlin," Journal of Strategic Studies 14 (March 1991): 90-111. 44 The purpose of these raids, especially that against Dresden, remains controversial, but certain facts speak for themselves. The 311-plane American operation against Dresden was mounted in combination with a British night raid of 770 planes; against rail yards in the cen­ ter of the city; through cloud cover, using radar bombing methods with an average error of two miles; and using a bomb mix including 40 percent incendiaries, the same percentage as the British. Compare this figure to an average of 11 percent for four other American raids against Dresden's marshaling yards from October 1944 to April 1945. (A second American raid, which dropped only high explosives, hit Dresden as a secondary target because their pri­ mary target that day, a synthetic oil plant, had poor weather). Moreover, rail yards were poor targets for incendiaries, because such weapons do little harm to heavy equipment or t
