because their pri足 mary target that day, a synthetic oil plant, had poor weather). Moreover, rail yards were poor targets for incendiaries, because such weapons do little harm to heavy equipment or tracks. Of the 9,042 tons dropped by the Americans on French rail yards in spring 1944, only 33 tons were incendiaries. Similarly, during Operation Clarion in 1945, when the Americans bombed dozens of transportation targets in Germany, only 3 of 7,164 tons were incendiaries. Melden E.

The destruction probably approached the limits of what conventional fire bombing could achieve against German towns, and thus the campaign can be considered to have satisfied the requirements of an ideal Douhet strategy.47 Nonetheless, the strategy faHed. There is no evidence that it produced any political pressure on German leaders or contributed much to the collapse of the German economy. As in the case of Japan, bombing did depress individ足 uals' spirits, though it is unlikely that it was the main cause of low morale. 48 Nevertheless, it failed to stimulate-indeed impeded-mllective political ac足 tion against the government. There were no mass demonstrations against the government or any other form of popular political activity. Civil disobedi足 ence was in
