rt. These measures introduced efficien­ cies more. than adequate to counter the effects of bombing on morale at least until late 1944.51 Finally, few industrial plants were located in city centers. Hence, bombing the population did not contribute much to damaging heavy industrial com­ plexes, which were located on the outskirts. In fact, most German authorities believed that expending bombs in countercivilian raids prolonged the life of German war industries and so helped sustain the war effort. As the USSBS observed, "Political, industrial, and military spokesmen frequently ex­ pressed both amazement and gratification over the Allied choice of targets; their belief, concurred in by practically every civilian interrogated, was that the cities could be rebuilt but that industry was vital to the pursuit of war."S2 American Strategic Interdiction, June 1943-1945 American strategic bombing of Germany began in earnest in June 1943 and aimed at strategic interdiction. 53 Although the industrial web theory had justified the procurement of a large strategic bomber fleet, it was never actually implemented. Instead, attacks were made against military equip­ ment plants and especially key basic industries critical to a wide range of 49 USSBS, Effects on German Morale, pp. 53-60, 65. The British Bombing Survey estimates that during 1944 and 1945 overall production losses attributable to town-area attacks ranged from 4.4 to 9.7 percent, and war production losses ranged from 0.9 to 1.2 percent.
