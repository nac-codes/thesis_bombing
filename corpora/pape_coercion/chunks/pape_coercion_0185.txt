c bombing began in October 1942, the initial operations were carried out with very small forces against operational interdiction targets, mainly submarine bases, primarily in France, but including a few in Germany.

Strategic interdiction came under a critical test during the fall of 1943. In a series of raids beginning on 17 August 1943, the ball-bearing plants at Schweinfurt were attacked. As a result, September production of bearings fell 65 percent. To keep production low, the plants were reattacked on 14 Oc­ tober, and again the target was badly damaged. Nevertheless, despite fur­ ther attacks during 1944, production at Schweinfurt was back to preraid levels by 1944, and there is no evidence from factory records or testimony of production officials that these attacks produced any measurable effect on es­ sential war production. 54 The ball-bearing offensive caused only a temporary setback in production because machines and machine tools were damaged far less severely than factory structures-a phenomenon common to raids on industrial targets. As a result, the Germans had the equipment to disperse part of their pro­ duction between the initial attacks in the autumn of 1943 and their resump­ tion in February 1944. Moreover, stocks of bearings turned out to be relatively generous, sufficient to tide the Germans over during the period when output was being restored. The Germans were able to cannibalize damaged equipment and weapons, draw down stocks, and redesign some equipment to use fewer bearings.55 Meanwhile, these unescorted daylight raids suffered prohibitive losses, including 62 of the 228 bombers in the sec­ ond raid on Schweinfurt, which was well above the 5 percent rate of losses that airmen would generally consider tolerable in sustained bombing oper­ ations. As a result, strategic bombing operations were stood
