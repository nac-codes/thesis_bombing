n Schweinfurt, which was well above the 5 percent rate of losses that airmen would generally consider tolerable in sustained bombing oper­ ations. As a result, strategic bombing operations were stood down until long-range fighter escort became available in early 1944.56 During January, operations resumed against aircraft and ball-bearing plants, which, although inflicting damage similar to past raids, did little to depress production. The USAAF did largely destroy the Luftwaffe during 1944 but almost entirely by air-to-air combat, not by bombing. From January to March, more than four thousand German aircraft were destroyed, after which the Luftwaffe conceded air superiority to the Allies, contesting mis­ sions only on occasion. The problem was not lack of aircraft, which were still being produced at a rate that could contest the Allied air forces, but lack of experienced pilots, which gave the decided advantage to the Allies in en- 54 USSBS, Summary Report (European War), pp. 14-15. 55 Ibid., p. 15; Craven and Cate, Army Air Forces 2: 703-4. 56 Both the Americans and the British thus began with daylight raids by unescorted bombers, and both were forced to abandon this mode of operation because of prohibitive losses, but their reactions were different. Instead of resorting to city burning, the Americans shifted temporarily to attacks on operational targets in France and the Low Countries before returning to strategic bombing of Germany in 1944. The difference can be accounted for by the absence of pressure for revenge, the Americans' greater interest in a cross-Channel inva­ sion, and the imminent availability of a long-range escort fighter (P-51).

Although one might argue that bombing Germany proper was necessary to force the Luftwaffe to fight, bombing military targets in France in preparation for the Allied landing would have had the same effect unless the Germans were prepared to concede
