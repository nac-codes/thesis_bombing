oper was necessary to force the Luftwaffe to fight, bombing military targets in France in preparation for the Allied landing would have had the same effect unless the Germans were prepared to concede the success of the invasion.57 The aircraft and ball-bearing campaigns illustrate the difficulties of ap­ plying strategic interdiction to a continental power such as Germany which controls vast resources. Germany was not exceptionally vulnerable to eco­ nomic shortages over the long term so long as it could extract resources from Europe as a whole. Temporary shortages of particular materials might occur, but these could often be resolved by state intervention because the huge size of the resource base provided many opportunities for substitution and conservation. As a result, there was no Achilles heel, no small, vulnera­ ble set of factories whose loss would cripple all war production, not even any important category. Even if they existed, moreover, it was nearly impossible to identify soft spots in the German war economy. In order to take substitution fully into ac­ count, it would have been necessary to monitor the daily performance of all sectors of the economy, involving hundreds of industries and many thou­ sands of individual plants, to predict accurately how the destruction of a handful of factories would ripple through the rest of the war economy. Even in peacetime, when access to information is relatively open, forecasts of enemy defense allocations at this level of detail are often in error. In war when the opposing government is seeking to prevent access to such information, es­ timates of current and prospective economic performance are even less reli­ able. The Allies were forced to base economic estimates mainly on agents' reports, press reports, and public statements by German officials rather than on primary documents or firsthand evidence. 58 The Allies thus estimated that Germany had gone to a total war economy early in the war, when in fact it had n
