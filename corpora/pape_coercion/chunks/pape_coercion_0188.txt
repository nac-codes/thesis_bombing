Most important, strategic interdiction aims at wrecking the manufacture of military equipment on the assumption that shortages of tanks, aircraft, guns, and other such materiel will cripple the fighting power of the enemy army.

In other words, al­ though many parts of the German economy ceased to function by the end of the war, no meaningful military equipment shortages were generated. Operational Interdiction, May 1944-May 1945 As the date for the invasion grew nearer, the air services were asked to de­ velop plans to support the ground offensive. This objective required a shift away from both Douhet and strategic interdiction plans, because the lag phase between inflicting damage on specific targets and measurable weak­ ening of German resistance was too long and uncertain.
