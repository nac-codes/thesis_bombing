plans, because the lag phase between inflicting damage on specific targets and measurable weak­ ening of German resistance was too long and uncertain. The pressure to reduce Allied ground casualties compelled a shift to an operational inter­ diction strategy designed to produce immediate reductions in German ground force mobility and fighting capacity. By March 1944 operational interdiction was supported by Dwight Eisen­ hower, commander of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, British Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder, Eisenhower's deputy, Charles Portal, chief of the British Air Staff, Carl Spaatz, commander of the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USSTAF), the Joint Intelligence Staff, the British Ministry of Economic Warfare, and the Enemy Objectives Unit (EOU) of the Office of Strategic Services. The only major dissenter was Arthur Harris, chief of RAF Bomber Command, who advocated the pri­ macy of area attacks on German cities.60 Although nearly all the senior Allied leaders approved of this shift in air strategy, there were significant differences over target selection. All agreed that gaining air superiority over Europe was the highest priority, but once this was achieved early in 1944, a major dispute arose as to whether oil or transportation should be hit next.61 The transportation plan developed by Solly Zuckerman, Tedder's scien­ tific adviser, aimed to destroy the rail, road, and river communications on which the German army depended. The core target set was the German rail­ way network because it carried the vast majority of very heavy loads, in­ cluding military vehicles and other heavy equipment. Rather than cut railway lines themselves, which could be easily repaired, the idea was to create roadblocks by bombing the principal marshalling yards, which acted as transportation hubs, coordinating the distribution of cars between in- 60 Major accounts of the shift in bombing strategies in early 1944 are Craven and Cate, Army Air Forces J
