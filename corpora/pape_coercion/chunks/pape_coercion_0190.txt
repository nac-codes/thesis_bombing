The plan also called for the destruction of seventy-six rail centers in France, Belgium, and West­ ern Germany.62 Americans, led by Spaatz, preferred oil to rail targets. Their brief was car­ ried by the EOU, which rejected railways on the grounds that there was too great a cushion of capacity for civilian and long-term industrial use above the minimum required by fighting units: "Military traffic forms a small pro­ portion of total traffic; at its maximum it will not be more than about one­ fifth of total traffic. A reduction of at least 30% could be made in European . rail traffic without affecting enemy military potential for a year.,,63 Oil, by contrast, was the foundation of German military operations.
