In addi­ tion, when the Soviet forces overran Romania in August 1944, Germany lost access to Ploesti oil fields, which accounted for 25 percent of production. By November Germany's oil production had dropped to about 30 percent of what it had been in the spring.66 By February 1945 the oil campaign had suc­ ceeded in lowering the output of fuel below the levels necessary for German forces to fight efficiently. After January large-scale operations by either the Luftwaffe or by motorized units of the German army were impossible. The failure of the Germans to gain much ground in the Ardennes offensive and their inability to prevent the Soviet breakout from the Baranov bridgehead in January, which led to the loss of Silesia, were both direct results of fuel shortages affecting the tactical mobility of motorized forces.67 The transportation offensive opened in May 1944 with heavy attacks on French rail yards and bridges designed to prevent the Germans from mov­ ing reinforcements from Germany or redeploying reserves already in France to meet the Normandy landing. Once the invasion forces were securely ashore, the effort against transportation was reduced in favor of intensified attacks against oil. The transportation campaign resumed in earnest
