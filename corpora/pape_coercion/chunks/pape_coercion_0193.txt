rmandy landing. Once the invasion forces were securely ashore, the effort against transportation was reduced in favor of intensified attacks against oil. The transportation campaign resumed in earnest from September 1944 onward, with heavy attacks on targets in Germany proper with the aim of shutting down rail movement in the entire area between the Rhine and the Western border. Tactical air forces interdicted bridges, lines, and train movements, and strategic air forces hit marshalling yards.68 The structure of German logistics combined rail and motor transporta­ tion. Approximately 300 to 450 tons of supplies of all types were required daily to support a German frontline division, depending on whether it was infantry or armor, during a normal day's fighting. To maintain a division's supply, trains would bring cargo from supply centers to army railheads (the average train was capable of transporting 450 tons), and then trucks and horses would deliver it to the fielded forces, with trucks carrying 30 percent and horses 70 percent. 69 Under the persistent pressure of the oil and communications offensives, the German army progressively lost the ability to provide combat forma­ tions with the supplies essential to their operations. During the Battle of Normandy, air interdiction reduced total deliveries to the German armies from the 5,250 tons per day thought necessary by German commanders to 3,JOO?O Initially, the effects of these shortages were mitigated by the exis- 66 Thomas A.
