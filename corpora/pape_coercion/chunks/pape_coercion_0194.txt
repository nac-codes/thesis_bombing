As the invasion progressed, however, the German lo­ gistic position deteriorated because the fluidity of the fighting reduced the usefulness of prepositioning supplies, while air interdiction made the movement of logistics more and more difficult. Starting in September 1944, heavy attacks were launched against mar­ shalling yards, bridges, lines, and train movements, producing a serious disruption in traffic throughout western Germany. Freight car loadings, which were approximately 900,000 in August, fell to 700,000 by the end of October, to 550,000 by the end of December, and to 214,000 by the first week of March 1945. Despite reduced industrial production from lost transporta­ tion, there was no immediate shortage of weapons for the German fighting forces.71 Rather, the main effect of lack of transport was the inability to put weapons and supplies in the hands of divisions actually fighting. On 23 March when the German forces retreated across the Rhine, combat forma­ tions were short almost all supplies other than food, especially fuel and am­ munition, even though r~ar depots contained large stocks until the end of the war.72 Strategic air power, however, was not the decisive cause of these effects. Whereas strategic forces damaged 20 of 25 marshalling yards, tactical air forces destroyed 12 of the 18 major bridges, 101 minor bridges, 4,000 loco­ motives, and 28,000 cars and created over 5,000 line cutS?3 The important point is that operations were interdicted mainly by tactical air attacks and these effects would have occurred even if the strategic offensive had not taken place.74 Invasion , The Allies' landing in France signaled a shift from coercion to conquest a
