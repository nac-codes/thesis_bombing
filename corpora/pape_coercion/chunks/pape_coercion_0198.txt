Contrary to early expectations at the time, strategic bombing was not de­ cisive. The question is whether it helped significantly or hardly mattered. The answer is that it made virtually no difference. Even if there had been no strategic bombing campaign at all, the war would have ended in the same way and at just about the same time. It is not true, as strategic bombing ad­ vocates insist, that bombing destroyed the German war economy, reducing replacements to the German army and leaving it less able to resist Allied of­ fensives. Although German industry was in drastic decline from mid-1944 onward, the existence of significant stockpiles of semifinished goods such as steel and refined oil products meant that German armaments production and the mobility of German forces were not seriously affected for several months more. Even as late as March 1945, armaments production was half of the July 1944 peak and almost 50 percent higher than in January 1942 (see Table 24).
