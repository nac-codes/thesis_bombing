Weapons and munitions production, while reduced, was still substantial in early 1945, although the fuel situation was more serious. The Ardennes offensive was the first major operation to suffer from serious fuel shortages, and by February and March 1945 most Panzer units on both fronts were effectively unable to move for offense or defense. Even if the German tanks had had fuel, the last round of Allied offensives would still have succeeded because of the enormous numerical and material superiority of the Allies. Virtually all major Allied offensives after July 1944 succeeded. Moreover, decline in the war economy was due mainly to territorial losses, not strategic bombing. Steel production was undermined by the loss of iron ore from Western Europe, and the loss of the Romanian (August 1944) and Hungarian (February 1945) oil fields crippled oil production. Finally, the collapse of German domestic transportation in February 1945, which caused the final disintegration of German war production, was due mainly to the operations of tactical air power flying from bases liberated by the Allied armies as they advanced across Europe rather than to strategic bombing. It could be argued that strategic bombing helped by compelling Germany to invest in antiaircraft defenses and by destroying the Luftwaffe in air-toÂ­ air combat with escort fighters, mainly during the first half of 1944. Even if there had been no strategic bombing effort, however, the Luftwaffe would still have been destroy
