price to preserve its territorial control. The effort to manipulate military vul­ nerability failed not because the Allies could not convince German leaders of their inability to defend the homeland, but because Hitler saw no point to a surrender that would bring the end of National Socialism, and the army generals who could have overthrown him believed that the Soviet army would exact such horrific revenge that the costs of immediate surrender would be higher than the costs of resistance to gain time for refugee move­ ment westward. In order to explain why Germany did not surrender prior to complete military defeat, we need to understand how the German state made conse­ quential decisions. We also need to know Germany's political objectives in the European war, and its military and diplomatic strategies for achieving them. We must correlate the increasing vulnerability of Germany's popula­ tion and military strategy to changes in German leaders' willingness to sur­ render. Since Germany did not surrender before complete defeat, we must determine the point at which the denial theory would have predicted capit­ ulation and ask why it did not come about. Finally, we must assess whether the factors that prevented surrender were unique to the German case or were simply extreme examples of the domestic political dynamics that make coercion of all modern nation-states difficult. German Decision Making Unlike some cases in which the military and political calculations of the target state's leadership cannot be measured directly and so must be in­ ferred from the behavior of the state as a whole, in the German case there is sufficient evidence to reconstruct the positions of the major groups within  File: --- pape_coercion.pdf --- Page 117 --- Bombing to Win the governing elite.82 The political elite was divided into four main parts: Hitler, the Nazi civilian leadership, the military leadership, and the anti­ Nazi resistance.
