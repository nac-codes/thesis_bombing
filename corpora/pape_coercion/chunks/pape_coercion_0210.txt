and in overrunning many of the in­ dustrial centers of the western Soviet Union, intensive mobilization of re­ maining industrial and manpower resources allowed the Soviets to field fresh armies and block the German advance, so that from the winter of 1941 onward the Germans were always outnumbered on the eastern front. The second phase began in late 1942 after EI Alamein, the Allied landing in North Africa, and the disastrous defeat at Stalingrad had shifted the ini­ tiative to the Allies. The eastern front remained the main front, where Ger­ many sought to maintain control of all occupied territory in order to keep resources needed to achieve victory in a long war of attrition. Hitler and his generals, however, disagreed over how attrition should be pursued. Instead of manning a broad front they could not hope to hold, the generals pre­ ferred a defensive attrition strategy under which German forces would withdraw to a narrower front where they could defeat Soviet offensive blows. Hitler, however, would not permit retreat and insisted on a strategy of offensive attrition based on limited attacks to disrupt the preparation of future enemy offensives. Offensive attrition failed with the bloody repulse of the attack at Kursk in July 1943, after which the Germans were forced into defensive attrition by continuous Soviet offensives.96 The third phase ran from summer 1944 to winter 1945. The second front in the west together with continuing Soviet advances eliminated any hope that Germany could ultimately defeat the combined resources of its enemies. Hitler nevertheless continued to rely on an attrition strategy in the hope that 93 According to the most detailed plan for postwar lebensraum policy, General Plan Ost, between 46 and 51 million people were earmarked for deportation as "undesirables."
