in by the end of January 1945. At this point German strategy disintegrated. German forces continued to resist on both fronts and to inflict significant casualties on the advancing Allies, but Germany no longer had the ability to present the Allies with the prospect that attrition would continue for a protracted period. Hitler was reduced to hoping that the Allied coalition would dissolve of its own accord, while many other Nazi officials and generals began acting independently to limit further war costs. For example, Himmler and Kesselring made attempts to negotiate with the Allies; Speer countermanded Hitler's scorched-earth policies; and Doenitz began military operations to protect the westward flow of refugees rather than to extend the survival of the Nazi state. Civilian and Military Vulnerability Although Germany was not coerced, this case can provide important ev­ idence about the relative effectiveness of coercive strategies based on civil­ ian vulnerabilities and military vulnerabilities. If one factor had more effect than the other on decision makers' positions on whether and how much Germany should surrender, then this evidence can be compared to the gen­ eral patterns of other cases, even if this effect was ultimately insufficient to change the behavior of the German state. To evaluate the relative effects of civilian and military vulnerability on German decision making, we must trace the effects of changes in either type of vulnerability on the positions of the important groups making up the German leadership. To do so, I divide the case into several discrete time slices and measure the degree of Germany's vulnerability to each type of threat in each period. If I can show that the preferences of a particular group changed at the same time a certain type of vulnerability increased and the 97 Alan Bullock, Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lines (London: Harper Collins, 1991), p. 865; idem., Hitler: A Study in Tyranny, rev. ed.
