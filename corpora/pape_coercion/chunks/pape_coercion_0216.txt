File: --- pape_coercion.pdf --- Page 125 --- Bombing to Win In July 1943 civilian vulnerability increased to high as more effective in­ cendiary techniques and larger numbers of bombers increased civilian damage by an order of magnitude. The large numbers of incendiaries caused fires too numerous for fire-fighting forces to contain, and the heat of the fires was often so intense that shelters offered little protection. The in­ creasing weight of attack together with the destruction of the Luftwaffe after winter 1944 meant that German protective measures could not signifi­ cantly reduce casualties. Civilian deaths in 1943, 1944, and 1945 (to May) are estimated to be 103,271, 201,000 and 101,000. 101 In October 1944 civilian vulnerability rose to very high, not because of any increase of the bombing but because Russian forces reached the outer borders of the Reich in east Prussia, triggering, in the midst of intense com­ bat along a broad front, the flight to the west of approximately four to five million civilians. 102 Soviet occupation was expected to be very brutal in re­ taliation for the German treatment of the Soviet population earlier in the war, and indeed, this fear was hardly unjustified. The total number of Ger­ man soldiers and civilians who died after the war, roughly four million, equals the number killed in combat during the war itself.103 Prior to fall 1942, military vulnerability was nil. Germany's strategy for defeating the Red Army had not yet lost its momentum. The German army was still advancing in the late summer and early fall of 1942, reaching its high-water marks in Staling
