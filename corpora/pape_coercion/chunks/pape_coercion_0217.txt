The German army was still advancing in the late summer and early fall of 1942, reaching its high-water marks in Stalingrad and the Caucasus in September and Octo­ ber.104 Military vulnerability rose to low in November 1942, with the Soviet en­ circlement of the quarter-million-man German Sixth Army at Stalingrad and the almost simultaneous defeat of Rommel in Egypt and the Anglo-Ameri­ can landing in northwest Africa. Although the front was still deep in the So­ viet Union, these events placed Germany on the strategic defensive. Some loss of occupied territory was certain, and even attacks on Germany proper had to be considered as an eventual possibility, as evidenced by Hitler's new slogan "defense of the Homeland," used in rallying the armies on the eastern front.lOs Germany's defeats of 1942, however, did not constitute con­ clusive evidence that its army would eventually suffer decisive defeat.
