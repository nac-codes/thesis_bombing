These two offensives destroyed the bulk of Germany's frontline combat strength in both theaters. Given its rapidly declining industrial output and 106 The military history of this period is discussed in Paul Kecskemeti, Strategic Surrender: The Politics of Victory and Defeat (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1958), pp. 119-21; Lid­ dell Hart, Second World War, pp. 477-97. The only military alternative, flexible operational warfare based on strategic withdrawals, might have had equally disastrous results in view of the balance of force that obtained after the end of 1942; it is also possible that it would only have hastened Germany's final defeat. To withdraw in order to re-form would have been to play into the hands of the Allies, for Germany's weakness lay not merely in the dispersal of its fighting forces but in the inferiority of all its resources to those at the enemy's command.

Germany could still impose considerable attrition, but the unmatchable materiel superiority of its enemies meant that Germany could no longer stalemate the Allied advances.
