have in­ vaded without the order of a capitulation. Exactly the same misery would have descended on Germany as has now arrived, perhaps in a still worse form, but the public might have believed that it was not the result of military defeat but of a 'stab-in-the-back.' ... Even when I consider the losses which followed until May, 1945, I still believe that the way to the bitter end was bet­ ter for Germany. It cannot give rise to false legends.1l6 To the extent that Nazi party leaders considered surrender at all, changes in their positions corresponded to increases in Germany's military vulnera­ bility, not civilian vulnerability. The principal figures on whom we have ev­ idence are Himmler, Goebbels, Speer, and Ribbentrop, none of whom shifted toward surrender in response to the escalations of city bombing in December 1940 or July 1943. By contrast, all were influenced by the worsen­ ing of Germany's military vulnerability, particularly from February 1945 on­ ward. 114 Bracher, German Dictatorship, pp. 273-'74, 276-77. 115 Quoted in ibid., p. 283. 116 "Excerpts from a Note about the July 20, 1944, Plot by Colonel General Alfred JodI, Nurenberg, 1946," in Armstrong, Unconditional Surrender, p. 277.

Goebbels was willing to negotiate in spring 1944; Ribbentrop and Speer seem to have come to this conclusion in February 1945; Himmler appears not to have changed his position until April. Prior to spring 1944, as military vulnerability increased from nil to medium, no important Nazi leaders favored surrender. Although some had doubts about Germany's military position in 1943 and 1944, none had con­ crete plans for surrender at this point. All spoke and behaved like ardent supporters of continuing the war, and most important, none backed the July 1944 p
