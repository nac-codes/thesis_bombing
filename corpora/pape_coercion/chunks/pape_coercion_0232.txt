and then never alone.J27 Thus, the coup's fail­ ure ended organized anti-Nazi resistance in Germany, and it became virtu­ ally impossible for individuals to act against Hitler. When the defensive lines of the Reich were breached in the east and west in January 1945, the position of even loyal military officers approached the surrender policies of the 20 July plotters. For instance, Chief of General Staff Guderian favored shifting resources to the east to check the further advance of the Soviets, even though the western forces would have quickly suc­ cumbed to the overwhelming material superiority of the Western Allies.128 After March despite Hitler's orders to defend on both the eastern and west­ ern fronts to the bitter end, military commanders in the west either surren­ dered piecemeal, stopped fighting, or disbanded their forces. The Allied advance into southern and central Germany became a walkover. Meanwhile German forces in the east continued their all-out effort to hold off the Soviet Union. Throughout the war, the anti-Nazi resistance opposed both national so­ cialism and the war, but this group had no political power at all in the Third Reich. It could influence policy only with military support, which was not forthcoming as long as the war appeared to go well. After an aborted assas­ sination attempt against Hitler in fall 1939, German successes in Poland and France made all further action impossible until after Stalingrad. Serious plotting against Hitler and attempts to recruit sympathetic military officers resumed in 1943, leading to six planned coup attempts between September and December 1943, culminating in the events of 20 July 1944.129 The resistance did not pursue unconditional surrender. Its members op­ posed communism as much as the Nazis, and therefore, they wanted a lim­ ited surrender to the west which would permit continued military resistance on the eastern front. They saw removing Hitler as both a gesture to the Western Allies and a dagger
