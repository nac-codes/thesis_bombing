Most im­ portant, the Army divided paws into racial and political categories and handed over the designated groups to the Einsatzgruppen. Of course, the Einsatzgruppen depended on the Army for munitions, fuel, and food.136 Moreover, the Wehrmacht directly killed millions of prisoners and civil­ ians.

The infamous Commissar Order called for the summary execu­ tion of all agents of "Judeo-Bolshevism" and estimates of the number shot range from 140,000 to 580,000. Of the 3.5 million Soviet prisoners captured during 1941, over 60 percent had died by February 1942, compared to a death-rate for paws inside the Reich of 18.5 percent.137 German figures count total deaths in POW camps in the East as 1,981,000, in addition to "Ex­ terminations; Not accounted for; Deaths and disappearance in transit," which totaled 1,308,000. Furthermore, the Army was also directly involved in the war against partisans, which involved punishing towns and villages and killing over a million civilian "traitors.,,13S Finally, the Wehrmacht ruthlessly exploited large parts of the occupied territories (Ukraine, Belorussia, western Russia, the Crimea, and the north­ ern Caucasus).
