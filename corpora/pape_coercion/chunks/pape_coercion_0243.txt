In fact, as I have shown, there were many attempts by members of the German resistance and some members of the Army to seek a one-sided armistice-that is, any agreement that would not require Germany to stop fighting on all fronts simultaneously. Opposition representatives proposed a two-stage surrender-an armistice in the west to be followed by total sur­ render after the eastern front was stabilized. The resistance was willing to go so far as to assist Anglo-British forces in France and to facilitate their entry into Germany. The plan fitted the belief of Rommel and others that it was better for Germany to become a British dominion than be ruined by fighting the war to completion.

Unilateral sur­ render does not appear to have been considered. Yet even without Allied agreement, we would expect German commanders in the west to have sur­
