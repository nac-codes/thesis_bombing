rs had more freedom of action. The motive for defending in the east, however, remained un­ changed, although the prospects of holding on for long had become quite dim. Yet, German leaders still did not surrender unilaterally in the west. Nevertheless, except in a few places still needed to protect escape routes for refugees, German officers and troops on the western front and some Nazi civilians began to surrender piecemeal, in a way that supports my interpre­ tation. German forces in areas that could not expect to receive refugees (southwest Germany and Italy) surrendered soonest, and those sites most important to the refugee traffic (Hamburg, Kiel, and the Baltic coast) held on the longest. Whereas the Germans spent their last ounce of strength to stop the Sovi­ ets, their resistance in the west quickly dissolved. In the first half of April British and American forces roared through western Germany, reaching the Elbe in just eighteen days, often meeting no opposition. At this point, Ger­ man commanders formally liquidated hostilities. Field Marshal Model, in charge of Army Group B defending the Ruhr, dissolved his command on 17 April, and its 300,000 men were dismissed from service, told to go home, or permitted to join other units. Others negotiated capitulation agreements. Field Marshal Kesselring, theater commander in Italy, agreed to surrender on 28 April, and the commanders of forces in Munich and Innsbruck sur­ rendered during the next few days.ls2 The refugee problem was especially acute late in the war. By April 1945 millions of civilians, particularly from northern Germany, were fleeing westward to escape the Soviets. IS3 Admiral Doenitz, who succeeded Hitler, said that his "first task is to save German men and women from destruction by the advancing Bolshevist enemy. It is to serve this interest that the mili­ tary struggle continues." He hoped to enable evacuations to continue for a few more weeks. To do so some continued resistance against the Western
