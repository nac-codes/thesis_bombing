The parsimonious version holds that if a state loses con­ fidence in its military strategy to achieve specific territorial goals, then it will stop pursuing those goals to avoid wasting resources in a futile effort. This theory clearly assumes that the political decisions of modern nation­ states are rational in the sense that they are motivated by cost-benefit cal­ culations. The German case could easily fall outside this theory of coercion if Ger­ many's geopolitical decisions were not rational. Indeed, conventional wis­ dom attributes Germany's refusal to surrender to Hitler's irrational personality, which determined the outcome because of Hitler's unique po­ sition in the government of German policy. According to this view, Hitler was the main reason why Germany failed to surrender, and cost-benefit po­ litical calculations were irrelevant. If this conception were correct, it would imply that the denial theory could not be applied until a metatheory was developed which could predict the conditions under which states will be­ have rationally. The "irrational dictator" explanation is wrong, however. Hitler's irra­ tionality does not explain Germany's failure to surrender, for Hitler could have been overthrown had a majority of the senior military leadership op­ posed his rule. Germany failed to surrender largely because German mili­ tary leaders would not accept unconditional surrender so long as it meant Soviet occupation, which they expected to be exceptionally brutal. In theo­ retical terms, Germany chose to continue the war because it expected the price
