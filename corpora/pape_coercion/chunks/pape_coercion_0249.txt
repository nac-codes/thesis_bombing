unconditional surrender so long as it meant Soviet occupation, which they expected to be exceptionally brutal. In theo­ retical terms, Germany chose to continue the war because it expected the price of surrender to be greater than the price of resistance. That these fears were rational is confirmed by the realities of postwar occupation. In other words, the correct implication is not that irrationality can dominate surren­ der decisions but in fact the opposite: states will not voluntarily make them­ selves worse off. The question is often asked, Is the German case unique? In one sense, Germany is hardly unique. It is always hard to coerce modern nation-states engaged in disputes over consequential issues, largely because domestic factors such as nationalism and institutional and individual political inter­ ests mitigate the coercive effects of punishment and denial strategies, al­ though to different degrees. The German case supports this finding. To the extent that German leaders shifted their positions on surrender at all, it was in response to military pressures that threatened to thwart their military strategy for controlling the contested territory. Punishment of the popula­ tion did nothing to encourage a popular revolt or to compel the government to abandon national objectives. Still, the German case is rare in one important respect.

Coercion may not apply against states that practice genocide, less because they are invulnerable to coercive military pressure than because they want more than control over territory. The end of World War II in Europe also offers three additional lessons on coercive air power. First, whereas strategic air power is capable of inflicting widespr
