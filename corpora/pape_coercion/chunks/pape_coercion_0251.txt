ven if one accepts the superb analysis of Alfred Mierzejewski that bombing transportation late in the war crippled the German economy, it would not have done so without Soviet progress in the east and the Allies' progress in the west. Destroying Ger­ many's internal railway system mattered because it stopped the movement of coal from mines in the Ruhr and Upper Silesia (Poland) to industries across Germany. The first determined bombing of internal German rail lines in September and October produced an immediate transportation (and coal) crisis, which the Speer ministry met by reallocating labor from the arma­ ments industry to transportation construction, enabling coal shipments to continue at about half their August 1944 rate.IS8 157 For instance, see USSBS, Summary Report (European War), p. 37. 158 For details on Germany's reallocation of labor to offset the coal crisis, see Milward, Ger­ man Economy, pp. 173-75.

File: --- pape_coercion.pdf --- Page 145 --- Bombing to Win The Germans were not able to offset the effects of the second round of transportation bombing from February to March largely because ground power had blockaded coal shipments from Poland and had enabled the Al­ lies' large tactical air forces to augment the strategic air forces. Following the Soviet advance through Upper Silesia, which was not accompanied by transportation bombing, coal shipments from this area collapsed to 10 per­ cent of the August rate.159 Coal shipments from the Ruhr declined radically between February and March (also to 10 percent of the August rate), when a combination of strategic and tactical air power was applied to stop all rail movement into (or out of) the Ruhr in preparation for its occupation by land forces.160 The bottom line is that without the progress of Allied ground forces, strategic air attack on transportation would likely have produced the
