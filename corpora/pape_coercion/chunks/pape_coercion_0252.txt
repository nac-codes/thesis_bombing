he Ruhr in preparation for its occupation by land forces.160 The bottom line is that without the progress of Allied ground forces, strategic air attack on transportation would likely have produced the dismal results expected by the Committee of Operations Analysts in Janu­ ary 1943. The German case also illustrates the central weakness of applying the in­ dustrial web theory of air attack to a continental power. At bottom, the in­ dustrial web theory seeks to impose an economic blockade from the air, the main criterion of success being whether the attacker can cause severe short­ ages of indispensable goods or services. The main problem is that whether critical shortages can be created is a function not of how goods are currently employed but of how well the economy as a whole can substitute for scarcity in individual products. Two factors are important: the size of the re­ source base and the efficiency of the government in reallocating resources. As a continental power with a highly educated population and sophisti­ cated government administration, Germany was well endowed on both. Ac­ cordingly, Germany could not be brought to the point of economic collapse by wartime shortages. Instead, the shortages that mattered were those relating directly to imme­ diate demands on the battlefield. Oil is the principal case. Destroying Ger­ many's production of fuel oil affected the fighting capability of the Wehrmacht not only because production was limited but also because Ger­ man forces consumed enormous amounts of oil in trying to defend the hun­ dreds of miles of front in the both the east and west. In other words, Germany's need to consume oil was driven by the need to maintain tactical mobility, which could not be replaced by horse-or manpower without sig­ nificant cost in effectiveness. Hence, once a shortage of oil actually occurred, it translated directly into lower fighting effectiveness, but it would not have been so important had not ground forces been pressing
