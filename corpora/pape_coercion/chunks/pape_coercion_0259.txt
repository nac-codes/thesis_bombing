wn theater stocks enough to meaningfully reduce the opponent's combat power. Still, strategic air power cannot be decisive. The most it can do is to reduce the costs that friendly land and theater air forces have to pay to de­ feat enemy forces on the battlefield. s 2 Strategic bombing is inherently harder than interdiction, requiring more expensive, longer-range bombers and more extensive air defense suppression, refueling, and other sup­ port. This is why strategic bombers have generally cost more than ten times tactical aircraft of the same era, a ratio that may be increasing for today's generation. For cost comparisons of the B-17 to tactical aircraft in World War II and the B-2 to the A-10 today, see Wesley Frank Craven and James Lea Cate, The Army Air Forces in World War II (Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1948), 6:}60; and Northrop Corporation, B-2 Stealth Bomber 1992 Fact Book (September 1992). 3 Although strategic bombing of Germany reduced ball-bearing production by 70 percent, Germans adjusted by curtailing non-essential (especially civilian) uses and by re-designing equipment to use fewer bearings.

S Of course, the likelihood that strategic air power can actually reduce the costs of defeat­ ing the enemy on the battlefield is declining as the cost of strategic bombers rises.
