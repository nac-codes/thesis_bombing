a much stronger coercive tool, useful in short wars as well as long and against irregular as well as regular forces.6 Although, like strategic bombing, theater air attack is effective only when combined with simultaneous pressure from ground forces, it gives the opponent much less scope to minimize consequences because effects are more immediate. Dis­ persing forces leads to piecemeal defeat, and reallocating scarce reserves or supplies to priority sectors can be obstructed by interdicting transportation routes. The isolated units can then be overwhelmed by friendly ground forces and close air support before logistic links can be reestablished. This hammer-and-anvil approach, if carried out repeatedly or on a large enough scale, undermines the opponent's ability to take or hold the disputed terri­ tory. The lesson of air power history is that strategic bombing is a very mar­ ginal coercive tool. In principle it could help shorten a coercive campaign, but it never has. Strategic bombing cannot substitute for ground and theater air pressure, but the combination of theater air power and land power can deny the opponent the capacity to control disputed territory, whether or not strategic bombing is also used. STRATEGIC BOMBING WON'T MATTER IN THE FUTURE In the aftermath of America's near bloodless victory in the Gulf War, strategic bombing has gained more popularity than at any time since Viet­ nam. Proponents claim not only that strategic bombing was the decisive fac­ tor but also that the Gulf War heralds a new age in which strategic bombing will be the strongest form of military power, dramatically enhancing Amer­ ica's coercive capability and options? Although these arguments are as yet vague and incomplete, they all cen­ ter around the ability of PGMs to destroy strategic targets more easily and bombers cost approximately 600 million dollars each (if the United States buys more than twenty}-or the equivalent of some ten thousand very good laser-guided bombs or Mave
