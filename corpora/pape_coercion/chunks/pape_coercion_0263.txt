Joint Theater Campaigns (Santa Monica: Rand, 1993). However, no one has shown that the large, slow-flying B-2 can survive the difficult-to-predict air defenses accompanying enemy ground forces. Other strategic air power advocates maintain that the American public has not only a low tolerance for casualties in its own ranks but also a low tolerance for protracted operations of any kind or even for enemy casualities. Glosson, "Impact of Precision Weapons," p. 8. As a result, in future conflicts the United States may not have the political staying power to wait for theater air attack to clear the'way for ground forces. Recent evidence does not support this argument. Despite concerns before the start of Desert Storm that there would pressure to ter­ minate the air war after just a few days, it was in fact continued for thirty-nine days until Iraq's ground forces were decimated. There was no public outcry when it was reported im­ mediately after the war that over 100,000 Iraqi troops had been killed, nor did estimates that 100,000 more Iraqis would die if sanctions were not lifted quickly generate noticeable public pressure against sanctions. 9 Warden, "Employing Air Power," pp. 66, 65-66, 64. Warden makes clear (p. 64) that the purpose of taking down the economy is not denial: "Note that destruction of the power sys­ tem may have little short-term effect at the front-if there is a front."  File: --- pape_coercion.pdf --- Page 153 --- Bombing to Win This argument is fatally flawed. Even if these economic effects could be caused as easily as advocates claim, they do not represent very severe pun­ ishment by historical strategic bombing standards. Bombing knocked out nearly all power generation in North Korea (90 percent), North Vietnam (85-90 percent), and Iraq (over 90 percent), but in no case caused the popu­ lation to rise up against the regime.10 The populations of Germany and Japan suffered vastly worse punishment-they were fire bombed!
