to be limited to transformers and switching yards, the generator halls and turbines of nearly every major plant were also destroyed.15 Repair assistance is also not a powerful in­ centive, because targets are often capable of restoring the damaged sys­ tems themselves. For instance, in the negotiations during and after the Gulf War, Iraq never asked for assistance with its power systems but was able to restore 68 percent of 1990 peak capacity and 75 percent of trans­ mission lines by August 1991.16 Third and most important, enthusiasts say that PGMs have made possible a new coercive air strategy-decapitation-which attacks leadership and national communications in order to achieve victory by changing or para­ lyzing an enemy government. Modem nation-states, it is argued, whether First World or Third World, increasingly rely on sophisticated communica­ tion systems connecting elite to elite and capital to field. As these systems become more sophisticated, they also become more brittle. Central tele­ phone exchanges, television stations, and radio transmitters are prominent, stationary, and easily destroyed by one or a few weapons. The result is strategic paralysis, which renders battlefield forces useless even if undam­ aged, as well as domestic political vulnerability as leaders are cut off from internal security organs. According to Warden, Capturing or killing the state's leader has frequently been decisive. In modern times, however, it has become more difficult-but not impossible-to capture or kill the command element. At the same time, command communications have been more important than ever, and these are vulnerable to attack. When command communications suffer extreme damage ... the leadership has great difficulty in directing war efforts.
