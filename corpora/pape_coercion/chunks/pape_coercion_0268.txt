apitation. The core problem is obtaining the intelli­ gence needed to kill enemy leaders who are making every effort to evade detection. Further, endangering regimes by cutting communications be­ tween leaders and their domestic security services requires detailed under­ standing not only of their formal communication links but also of backup and informal control systems, as well as the loyalties and motivations of in­ dividual leaders and units. Without precise intelligence, precise weapons can precisely destroy targets that are not in use. Unknown to the Coalition, Iraq removed the key equipment from its central telephone exchange in Baghdad before the Gulf War began, so we destroyed a building, not a sys­ tem.19 The Iraqis had evidently made plans to do without it. Finally, even if leaders can be hit and communication networks severed, estimating whether military effects can be translated into regime change is a problem of political forecasting, and an uncommonly difficult one. We have no theories that can predict in either democratic or non-democratic polities whether 17 Warden, "Employing Air Power," p. 65.

For example, see Gary Waters, Gulf Lesson One-the Value of Air Power: Doc­ trinal Lessons for Australia (Canberra: Air Power Studies Centre, 1992), p. 170. 18 PGMs are sometimes said to be essential for destroying hardened targets such as com­ mand bunkers. During Desert Storm the United States developed a five-thousand-pound laser-guided bomb to destroy a bunker that two-thousand-pound laser-guided bombs could not penetrate. The advantage of PGMs is accuracy, not penetration, however. An equally heavy dumb bomb can destroy the same targets provided a direct hit is achieved. It may be necessary to drop considerably more bombs to hit the target, but it is still feasible if the num­ ber of such targets
