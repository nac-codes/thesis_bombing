always limited in number whereas theater targets are al­ ways virtually infinite. In fact, however, some of the most effective types of PGMs are not expensive; a typical laser-guided bomb (the GBU-12) costs about ten thousand dollars. Compared to the cost of building and maintain­ ing the aircraft, training the crew, and providing basing, communications, aerial refueling, air superiority, and other support, the difference between this and a cheaper dumb bomb is very small. Theater targets such as a $1.5 million T-72 Soviet-made tank can easily justify their use.22 Of fifteen thou­ sand PGMs used by U.S. aircraft in Desert Storm, at least ninety-five hun­ dred were used against theater targets.23 Since strategic bombing advocates claim that PGMs enhance punish­ ment, risk, and decapitation, it may seem surprising that they have not raised the question of whether PGMs enhance strategic bombing for de- 20 Cheap, mobile, and flexible communications technology is proliferating throughout the Third World. Fiber-optic land lines, which can handle thousands of channels, can be dis­ pensed from a reel mounted on the back of a truck. The average per-capita gross domestic product of countries launching cellular telephone networks has fallen from $14,500 in 1979-1982 to about $1,500 today and a projected $600 in 1998. In 1994 the command system of the Rwandan Patriotic Front was based on mobile cellular phones.

An F I A-18 ElF costs $60 million, plus $111 million in twenty-year operating costs. Assuming that it flies a hundred combat mis­ sions over its lifetime and that it drops four LGBs per mission, the aircraft alone costs $43,000 per bomb dropped.
