Since strategic bombing can affect denial only in long wars of attrition, anyone proposing this approach would be in the position of advocating a long-war strategy, probably in­ volving heavy casualties even for the winner-hardly an attractive prospect. 2S Beyond this, there is an even more powerful reason why strategic bombing for denial is unlikely to matter in the foreseeable future: there is no possible opponent against which strategic bombing would be both use­ ful and possible. The twin military-technological revolutions of nuclear weapons and PGMs ensure this. Any opponent that is not one of the world's major economic powers cannot possibly replace equipment as fast as a PGM-armed attacker can destroy it, and will be defeated when pre­ war stocks are used up. If the opponent is one of the world's economic powers, it will almost certainly be nuclear-armed and able to deter strate­ gic attack. Modern PGMs, including air-to-ground, surface-to-air, and antitank weapons, have increased loss rates on the conventional battlefield far be­ yond the capacity of all but the largest economies to replace. In the 1973 war Israel lost 200 tanks, Egypt 1,150, and Syria 1,150 in eighteen days, and in 1991 Iraq lost 2,633 in forty-three days-or annual rates of 4,056, 23,000, 23,000, and 22,000, respectively.26 None of these countries pro­ duced any tanks during these wars; Israel now produces fewer than a hundred per year.27 Although any country involved in a long war can dra­ matically increase military production, months or years are required. Against a PGM-equipped opponent, any country at all, with the possible exception of a few
