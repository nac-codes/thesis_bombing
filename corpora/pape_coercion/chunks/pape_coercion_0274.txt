also allow aircraft to attack from a safer distance and altitude, avoiding the densest ground fire. 28 At the indicated loss rates, Israel, Egypt, Syria, and Iraq would have lost their entire tank inventories, including reserves and obsolete models, in 180, 35, 28, and 7B days respectively.

The United Kingdom Challenger 2 production will be thirty per year through 1998. France's Leopard 2 production has averaged three hundred per year since 1982. Russian T-80 production is estimated at two thousand per year from 1983 to 1993.

Posen, Inadvertent Nuclear Escalation: Conventional War and Nuclear Risks (Ithaca: Cor­ nell University Press, 1991). 32 Many other types of theater targets, such as towed artillery, trucks, and unhardened communications sites and depots are vulnerable to near misses. Thus, although easier to hit with PGMs, attacking them with unguided munitions is feasible. 33 During the Gulf War, the Coalition launched approximately 9,500 PGMs of types com­ monly used against armored vehicles, and destroyed 2,500 tanks and APCs, yielding a kill rate of 26 percent, although since we carmot be sure that none of these weapons was used against any other target types or that all the tank and APC kills were due to PGMs, the true rate may be either higher or lower.
