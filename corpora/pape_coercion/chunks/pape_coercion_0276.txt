sults. In the Pacific the United States fire-bombed smaller and smaller Japanese cities after burning the largest ones had no discernible effect. In Korea the United States waged three separate pUnishment campaigns, in 1950, 1952, and again in 1953, despite the fact that the earlier efforts pro­ duced no coercive results at all. Finally, in 1991 American strategic bombing advocates assumed that levels of punishment far lower than those visited on Germany, Japan, Korea, or Vietnam would bring Iraq to its knees. Strategic bombing persists for four main reasons. First, it serves the bu­ reaucratic interests of air forces. Second, both civilian and military leaders 34 Of course, PGMs may some day be cheaply countered. For a history of competition be­ tween offensive and defensive weapons which shows that each new advance tends to trigger countermeasures, see Bernard Brodie and Fawn M. Brodie, From Crossbow to H-Bomb: The Evo­ lution of the Weapons and Tactics of Warfare (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1973). 35 At least in open terrain and clear weather. With PGMs, anything that can be seen can be hit, so the more closed-in the weather or terrain, the less they matter. 36 Thus, most air forces would be better off investing in detection (e.g., air-to-ground radar) to enhance their ability to destroy theater targets rather than in penetration (e.g., stealth) which is most useful for strategic attack.

Third, ignorance allows strategic bombing enthusiasts to sway policy deci­ sions with unsupported assertions. Fourth, deliberate obfuscation of the brutality of strategic-bombing campaigns to shield them from criticism also impedes evaluation. The most important institutional interest of air forces, like other bureaucra­ cies, is maintenance of institutional independence and autonomy. Of the three main air combat missions-air
