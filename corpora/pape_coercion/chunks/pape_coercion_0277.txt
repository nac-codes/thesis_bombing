es evaluation. The most important institutional interest of air forces, like other bureaucra­ cies, is maintenance of institutional independence and autonomy. Of the three main air combat missions-air superiority, tactical bombing, and strategic bombing-strategic bombing serves this interest best because it is an inher­ ently independent mission, requiring little coordination with other services.37 Theater air attack, because it must be closely coordinated with the plans and movements of ground forces, risks loss of control over air operations in wartime to ground commanders and could threaten control over missions and budgets even in peacetime.38 Air superiority enhances air force autonomy but only to the extent that it is associated with strategic bombing, which re­ quires control of air space over enemy territory. Absent strategic bombing, air superiority could in principle be limited to control of air space over fielded forces and homeland territory. Thus truncated, air superiority would not un­ ambiguously justify an independent air service. Armies already participate in air defense of the battlefield and friendly rear areas with anti-aircraft artillery and missiles; arguably, taking over control of interceptor aircraft could im­ prove air defense coordination. After all, navies traditionally provide all as­ pects of their own air defense-guns and missiles as well as aircraft.39 Civilians and the other military services have their own reasons for going along with strategic bombing. Sometimes civilian leaders are hardly in­ volved in military strategy, as in the cases of Roosevelt in World War II and Bush in the Gulf War. Sometimes, like Johnson and Nixon in the Vietnam War, they actively support strategic bombing as a cheap alternative to long, costly, and politically unattractive ground campaigns. Civilians also some­ times turn to strategic bombing for revenge or to maintain morale when the public is suffering heavy costs, as did Churchill against Germany and
