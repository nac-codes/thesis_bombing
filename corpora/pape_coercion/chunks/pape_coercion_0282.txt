e effects of bombing, we should also study blockades, embargoes, do­ mestic unrest, natural disasters, and possibly commodity price inflation.

Finally, since denial appears to be the most effective coercive strategy, we must learn more about how governments and publics evaluate the success or failure of national policy, and how evaluation changes in crises and wartime. These are all problems of social science, not military art. For their part, governments should create per­ manent organizations composed of individuals with expertise in a variety of military and civilian fields and disciplines to study the various politi­ cal effects that alternative uses of force might produce. Such groups would not actually design a set of contingency plans to coerce countries across the globe. Even if they were given such a fantastic charter, such plans could not hope to bear on the exact context of any specific future dispute. Rather, such groups should serve as repositories of knowledge about the general political, economic, and social effects of various appli­ cations of force, which would be available to policy makers considering intervention in international disputes. The objection could be raised, Will not increased study of military coer­ cion lead to increased use of it? It is not impossible that someone could dis­ cover a previously unimagined coercive approach, but such a theory should not be accepted unless the causal mechanisms on which it relies can be em­ pirically proved. History suggests, however, that ignoring coercion is likely to do more to engender false optimism than to deter the use of force. Policy makers are often more optimistic about the chances for coercive success than situations warrant. Only thorough investigation in peacetime of the ca­ pabilities and limitations of coercive air power can
