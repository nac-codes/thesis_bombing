kers are often more optimistic about the chances for coercive success than situations warrant. Only thorough investigation in peacetime of the ca­ pabilities and limitations of coercive air power can defeat unwarranted con­ fidence in crisis or wartime policy making. Further, an understanding of coercion based on denial is much less likely than other coercive theories to produce unwanted military quag­ mires, because fielding the forces necessary to thwart the opponent's mil­ itary strategy for control of the disputed objective will often be so obviously expensive ex ante that the potential coercer will be self-de­ terred. Thus coercion would be likely to be attempted only over issues so important to the coercer that it would be willing to pay the full costs of military victory. In this situation coercive failure would be much less cata­ strophic, since military commitments will not have been based on false hopes of obtaining a cheap solution, and since the nation's forces will al­ ready be constituted to obtain the objective by force if the opponent is not forthcoming. For their part, the military services should re-orient their doctrines and organization to focus more on the problem of destroying armies from the air. Although theater air attack is, and will likely remain, the most effective coercive air strategy, neither the U.S. Air Force nor the Army has seriously studied the vulnerabilities of field armies to air attack, either separately or  File: --- pape_coercion.pdf --- Page 164 --- Beyond Strategic Bombing jointly.44 To realize fully the potential of theater air power requires under­ standing the set of possible strategies for controlling territory; the depen­ dence of each strategy on logistics, communications, firepower, mobility, and personnel; and how damage to each of these components affects the vi­ ability of these strategies. The Air Force and Army should cooperate to solve this problem. Admittedly, to do so both services would have to put aside co
