ge to each of these components affects the vi­ ability of these strategies. The Air Force and Army should cooperate to solve this problem. Admittedly, to do so both services would have to put aside concerns about loss of institutional autonomy, and that is inherently diffi­ cult for bureaucracies to do, but it is the way to maximize military and, hence, coercive effectiveness in an era of declining forces. America's stun­ ning success in the Gulf War without addressing these issues is no cause for confidence, for in that war the United States could deploy forces so superior to the enemy's that either the Army or the Air Force could have won the war virtually unassisted and, in effect, each did. Finally, both publics and policy makers should stop thinking of coercion as a a silver bullet to solve intractable foreign policy dilemmas. Coercion is no easier, only sometimes cheaper, and never much cheaper, than imposing demands by military victory. If all coercion were a function of civilian vulnerability, then coercion would indeed often be cheap and easy. Quite small military forces can usu­ ally raise civilian costs enough to cause observable declines in the general welfare of population centers. Coercion would then be simply a matter of designing the correct formula of threats and actions, of sticks and carrots, to persuade that opposing population that they had something to lose by not altering their behavior. Fortunately this is not the world we live in. If it were, military coercion would be far more common than it is. This means that advocates of counter­ civilian coercion not only recommend harming innocent civilians, but they do so for no good purpose. Civilian threats are thus both wasteful and im­ moral. This lesson applies not only to the United States, but also to all states, including those in the Third World, which are increasingly acquiring mod­ em aircraft and missiles that can strike at the homeland of other states. If a state faces the grim necessity
