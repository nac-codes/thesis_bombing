identifying a point of competition that existed between RAF Bomber Command and the heavy bomber units of the US Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces. The image sought by the latter air forces and their superiors clearly was one of being more accurate than RAF Bomber Command's night-time general area offensive, and by a substantial margin. Questions remain, however, as to whether the US heavy bomber forces were as accurate as they portrayed themselves, and whether -when a fair comparison is made -they were more accurate than RAF Bomber Command. The British did prosecute a general area offensive against Germany, and the Americans did follow -much of the time, at least -a policy of selective targeting against military and industrial installations thought to be contri­ buting directly to the German war effort. But the image conveyed by the word precision is inappropriate to describe USAAF heavy bomber practice. Enemy defences kept the American daylight bombers from achieving the results they sought, and the consistently poor European weather regularly forced the Americans to bomb using radar aids-a practice that inevitably led to unsatisfactory results as the Americans were not as well trained, equipped, or experienced as the British in radar-bombing techniques. Under certain con­ ditions and in the latter phases of the war -when both were operating mature,  File: --- parks_preciscion.pdf --- Page 3 --- 'PRECISION' AND 'AREA' BOMBING 147 full-strength forces-RAF Bomber Command was more successful in placing its bombs on target than the Americans. This essay examines the historical record of the heavy bomber forces of the USAAF and RAF to determine the nature of their respective bombing practices, and to sort out the real meaning of the terms precision and area bombing. USAAF Bombing Accuracy RAF Bomber Command's movement to a night-time general area offensive, necessitated by operational requirements, is well documented.• The sub­ sequent entry of US heavy bomber forces into
