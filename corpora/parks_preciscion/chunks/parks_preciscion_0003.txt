bing Accuracy RAF Bomber Command's movement to a night-time general area offensive, necessitated by operational requirements, is well documented.• The sub­ sequent entry of US heavy bomber forces into the fray was surrounded by USAAF characterisation of its capabilities as 'precision', 'pickle barrel', and 'pin-point' bombing -descriptive terms participants and the official USAAF history acknowledge were exaggerations and that of which legends, not history, are made.5 If the USAAF leadership persisted in its public emphasis on 'pickle barrel' accuracy, it harboured no illusions as to the size of that barrel when it became necessary to convert USAAF airpower theory into practice in order to build the heavy bomber force necessary to wage a strategic bombing offensive against Germany. In August 1941 the newly-formed US Air War Plans Division, borrowing heavily from British data and experience, using bombing range probable errors for US bombardment units for June through December 1940 multiplied by a factor of 2.25 squared, or five times peacetime bombing (to estimate the influence of enemy defences and other combat effects on bombing accuracy), offered calculations as to the probability of success in attack of a target 100 by 100 feet (10,000 sq. ft.) in size. Its calculations were that, bombing from 20,000 feet with 500lb or 1 ,OOOlb bombs, a single hit under visual conditions would require a force of 220 bombers. The proba­ bility of at least one hit by a Combat Wing (54 aircraft) dropping 108 bombs was 75 per cent.• The American air leadership nonetheless persisted in emphasising the superior accuracy of its bombing potential over that of RAF Bomber Command's night offensive. In selling the complementary nature of a 'round­ the-clock' approach to bombing Germany at the Casablanca Conference, Eighth Air Force commander Major General Ira C. Eaker declared ... [D]ay bombing is more accurate; small targets like individual tar­ gets can be found, seen, and hit ... The tr
