tight formation, with each aircraft dropping its bombs on signal from its lead aircraft. This practice of 'bombing on leader' was tested on 3 January 1943, and generally adopted by all groups over the next three months. While it increased the percentage of bombs that fell within 1,000 feet of each aiming point, accuracy was one-third that possible with individual bomb runs, resulting in bomb pattern dimen­ sions of 1 ,500 feet in length and breadth for each combat box under optimum visual bombing conditions. 'Pickle barrel' accuracy yielded to pattern bomb­ ing.' Early missions made it apparent that bombing regarded as 'accurate' might not produce a corresponding measure of damage to the target; bombs landing between vital portions of a target might be gauged as 'accurate' because they fell within I ,000 feet of the aiming point, but in fact cause no damage because they struck open areas. Accuracy was relative, depending on the position of the observer. On Eighth Air Force's second mission against the Rouen-Sotteville marshalling yard (5 September 1942), 80 percent of the force's bombs fell outside the marshalling yard and into the city, killing as many as 140 civilians and wounding another 200. Eighth Air Force claims of 'precision' bombing were not particularly appreciated by the French, who were justifiably sceptical about the ability to bomb accurately from 25,000 feet. It was a problem that would plague US heavy bombers striking targets in proximity to friendly civilians or Allied ground forces throughout the war; high-altitude formation bombing was not a precision tool. In contrast, the  File: --- parks_preciscion.pdf --- Page 5 --- 'PRECISION' AND 'AREA' BOMBING 149 official USAF history notes that RAF Bomber Command during this same period was referred to by the French as 'une arme de precision remarquable'. This contradiction with the public image projected by the USAAF leadership may be explained by the fact that, except for French ports containing U-boat
