e French as 'une arme de precision remarquable'. This contradiction with the public image projected by the USAAF leadership may be explained by the fact that, except for French ports containing U-boat bases, the British general area bombing campaign was limited to targets in Germany.9 USAAF accuracy claims were qualified by deletion of targets of oppor­ tunity and two categories of errors. Targets of opportunity were bombed if the assigned target could not be attacked. A target of opportunity was selected by the mission leader, and included marshalling yards in urban areas and city centres. Mission failures were missions in which no box in an attack­ ing force was able to place more than five per cent of its bombs within 1,000 feet of its aiming point; a circular error by a combat box in excess of 3,000 feet on a mission was termed a gross error. Mission failures and gross errors were omitted from any analysis of accuracy. These failures were the product of both mechanical and human error, and increased with combat. They also could be intentional; because bombs dropped on a target of opportunity were not measured against a unit's accuracy, cases were reported in which bomb leaders elected to bomb a target of opportunity if doubt existed as to identifi­ cation of the aiming point of the primary target, in part to protect the unit's rating in accuracy comparisons.10 RAF Bomber Command also discounted gross errors, but with a broader definition (bomb falls which did not conform to the general pattern of bomb falls laid down in the mission). A distinction existed in the degree of gross error, however, due undoubtedly to the American practice of navigating to a target by group as compared to individual navigation by RAF Bomber Command crews; when a US formation leader suffered a navigation error or prematurely released his bombs, the entire group tended to follow his lead. These omissions from bombing accuracy ranged from 20 to 50 per cent for Eighth Air Force, while 14
