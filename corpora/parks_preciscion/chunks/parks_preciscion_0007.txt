ed a navigation error or prematurely released his bombs, the entire group tended to follow his lead. These omissions from bombing accuracy ranged from 20 to 50 per cent for Eighth Air Force, while 14 per cent of RAF Bomber Command's bombs dropped resulted in gross errors.'' As Eighth Air Force increased its aircraft numbers, other problems affecting bombing accuracy were discovered; more aircraft on a mission was not necessarily better, for example. The bombing of the first two groups consistently was more accurate than that of following groups because smoke from the first attacks obscured the target for following formations. Adjustments in separation of combat wings improved bombing accuracy: 12  File: --- parks_preciscion.pdf --- Page 6 --- 150 AIRPOWER: THEORY AND PRACTICE TABLE I PER CENT OF TOTAL WEIGHT OF BOMBS DROPPED WHICH FELL WITHIN 1,000 FEET OF AIMING POINT Position in I Jan-26 Ju/I943 27 Jul-I Sept I943 % Attacking Force Improvement 1st 26.4 27,5 5 2nd 15.7 20.5 32 3rd 9.7 15.3 58 4th 7.5 16.0 105 5th & over 5.0 13.8 178 Entire force 13,6 18.7 38 Operations revealed other factors that affected accuracy. Flak forced bombers to bomb from higher altitudes, diminishing accuracy while affecting the size, shape, and density of bomb patterns. The delay in long-range fightÂ­ ers to accompany bomber forces to the target not only caused Eighth Air Force to suffer substantial losses during 1943, but demonstrably affected bombing accuracy by a strained, debilitated force that had to fight its way to its target. Other German defensive measures, such as decoys, camouflage, and smoke were successful in denying American bomber forces the accuracy desired. The difference could be significant: 13 TABLE 2 US BOMBING ACCURACY AS AFFECTED BY SMOKE SCREENED AND UNSCREENED TARGETS AT ALTITUDES OF 25,000 FT Visibility Condition Smoke-screened targets Unscreened targets Estimated Per Cent of Bombs Within 500ft of AP I ,000 ft of AP 1.8 7.8 5.4 22.7 Each of these factors affected
