AT ALTITUDES OF 25,000 FT Visibility Condition Smoke-screened targets Unscreened targets Estimated Per Cent of Bombs Within 500ft of AP I ,000 ft of AP 1.8 7.8 5.4 22.7 Each of these factors affected US bombing accuracy. But the most impor­ tant factor affecting mission accomplishment was weather, and the effect of weather on USAF bomber accuracy was greater than on RAF Bomber Command. RAF Bomber Command found that European weather significantly affected its early operations, and advised the authors of A WPD-1 of its experience; European weather was recognised in A WPD-1 as influencing planning and execution, just as the American World War I strategic bombing plan ('the Gorrell Plan') had acknowledged its importance. Early US heavy bomber operations were seriously hampered by the weather, to the extent that General Dwight D. Eisenhower (Commander, European Theater of Operations, US Army) advised Major General Carl A. Spaatz (Commander,  File: --- parks_preciscion.pdf --- Page 7 --- 'PRECISION' AND 'AREA' BOMBING 151 Eighth Air Force) on 7 October 1942 that the necessity for good weather was that command's 'only one real weakness', a point acknowledged by General Eaker at Casablanca and in correspondence with USAAF Chief General H. H. Arnold. 14 Weather was the major adverse operational factor during 1943 operations, and remained a controlling factor once US heavy bomber capabilities reached full maturity in spring 1944. The number of days on which operations could be executed, the area(s) that could be attacked, force size, attack timing and bombing method were determined primarily by weather. Weather restrictions on visual bombing limited accuracy and, concomitantly, the amount of destruction likely to be achieved. Weather particularly affected USAAF bomber forces. Operating indi­ vidually at night, RAF Bomber Command crews became instrument and navigation-aids proficient, and were able to operate under a greater variety of weather conditions than their counterpar
