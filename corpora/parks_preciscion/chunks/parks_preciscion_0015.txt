Blind bombing data from 15 October to 15 December 1943 indicates that only 6 of 151 combat boxes dropped their bombs within one mile of the aim­ ing point; 17 within 2 miles; and 30 or not quite 20 per cent, within five miles -a record no better than that recorded for night-bombing RAF crews in the Butt Report two years earlier. Blind bombing permitted US heavy bombers in December 1943 to drop more bombs than in any preceding month despite bad weather, but a report (31 January 1944) concluded that blind-bombing missions had averaged only five per cent of the bombs falling within five miles of the aiming point -accuracy worse than that recorded for Bomber Command in the Butt Report. 24 Despite its inaccuracy, the USAAF relied heavily on H2X. Of the American attacks against Germany, radar was responsible for 61 per cent of all bomb tonnage; of the 61 per cent, 81 per cent was delivered using H2X. Yet neither the 10 em H2S nor the 3 em H2X/H2S Mark III presented as clear a picture as attributed to it by some. Over large urban areas the entire screen was filled with an 'intense blaze
