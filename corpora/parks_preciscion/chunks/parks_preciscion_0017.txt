In contrast, equipping Eighth Air Force bombardment groups with H2X did not see progress until late in 1944:30 TABLE 3 US EIGHTH AIR FORCE BOMBARDMENT GROUPS WITH H2X PATHFINDER AIRCRAFT. 1944 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul I I 4 4 6 8 II Aug 24 Sep 28 Oct 35 Nov 38 Dec 39 Operational research of bombing accuracy suffered because H2X matters were dealt with exclusively by advisers to Eighth Air Force from the US Radiation Laboratory. The Eighth Air Force Operational Research Section was unable to 'rate the Groups' monthly on their H2X bombing accuracy (as it had done so successfully in enhancing visual accuracy) because a policy decision had been made that Groups were not to be charged for bombs dropped blind. The US program also was hampered by personnel problems. Just as the blind-bombing program was getting underway in the autumn of 1943, moves were afoot to close down the operational training unit at Langley Field, Virginia, needed for H2X operators, much to the consternation of General Eaker. One year later, personnel requirements for H2X operators could not be fulfilled; 124 H2X operators were required in November 1944, for example, yet none had arrived by 22 November, and only 44 were scheduled to arrive in each of November and December. H2X navigators trained in the US required further training upon reaching Alcon bury. H2S/X training differed significantly between Bomber Command and Eighth Air Force. Each RAF designee received a rigorous six-month training course in which he was taught by experts in navigation and radar bombing. Before participating in Pathfinder missions,
