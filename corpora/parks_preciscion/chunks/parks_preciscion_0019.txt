n accuracy figures; thus the five per cent figure does not accurately represent actual performance. 32 RAF Bomber Command Selective Attack Accuracy Through 1943 RAF Bomber Command remained committed to the general area offensive. But neither selective attack nor precision bombing had been abandoned. A chain of events was to enable Bomber Command to open a parallel selective attack effort that would enhance its accuracy. A Pathfinder Force had been established within Bomber Command in August 1942 as a target-finding force; it proved invaluable after initially failing to live up to expectations. During 1943 it improved its ability to mark targets for the main force. The sudden increase in accuracy in early 1943 (Figure 2)33 can be attributed to operational use of Oboe and H2S, and use of target indicator markers as a ground-marking technique. In the spring 1943 Oboe campaign against Ruhr targets, 73 per cent of the attacking bombers placed their bombs within three miles of the aiming point; in the autumn 1943 H2S campaign against more distant cities, 55 per cent of the attacking force bombed within three miles of their aiming points. On 24 March 1943, No.617 Squadron was formed to carry out a night low­ level precision attack against three Ruhr Valley dams. The mission was executed on 16 May 1943, with moderate success. Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Bomber Command, dis­ liked corps d' elite, but agreed to maintain No.617 Squadron for similar tasks. Other requirements came for 617 Squadron and No.8 Group's Pathfinder Force in rapid succession -attacks on aircraft factories, marshalling yards, choke points on the German river and canal system, the battleship Tirpitz, Peenemiinde V-weapons establishment, and the December 1943-January 1944 'Crossbow' attacks on V1 sites, for example -leading to further refine­ ments in capability and accuracy. From 1943 to the end of 1944, relative density (per 1,000 tons dropped) at the aiming point
