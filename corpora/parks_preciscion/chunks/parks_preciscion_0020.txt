From 1943 to the end of 1944, relative density (per 1,000 tons dropped) at the aiming point increased more than five­ fold.34 In February 1944 Chief of the Air Staff Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir  File: --- parks_preciscion.pdf --- Page 15 --- 0. ~ 0 "' FIGURE 2 R.A.F.

Raids against 11 marshalling yards and similar strategic and tactical targets between 6 March and 10 April 1944, were executed despite the doubts of Air Chief Marshal Harris, but with an accuracy that he acknowledged surprised him. They would be followed by similar night-time precision attacks against French rail­ way and other small targets in support of Operation 'Overlord', and its use in direct support of allied ground operations after D-Day. The former placed emphasis on an absolute minimum of collateral civilian injury;
