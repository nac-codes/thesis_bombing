mall targets in support of Operation 'Overlord', and its use in direct support of allied ground operations after D-Day. The former placed emphasis on an absolute minimum of collateral civilian injury; it required specialised techniques, leading to performances that were frequently more accurate than daylight visual attacks by Eighth Air Force. Improved target marking (more than bomb aiming) resulted in a 165 per cent increase in accuracy in marshalling yard attacks of May 1944 over those executed in March, which in and of themselves had set new standards for night-time accuracy. 35 The attacks in support of Allied ground forces showed the same distinction between US and British bombing forces that generally occurred in precision attacks against selective targets: while Eighth Air Force employed combat boxes from high altitude that bombed on the leader's signal, RAF Bomber Command aircraft executed medium and low altitude individual attacks aim­ ing at target indicators delivered on to the target by pathfinder aircraft. Night­ time attacks proved more accurate than USAAF daylight visual bombing, and with a greater density of bombs at the aiming point. This encouraged the Air Staff to press Bomber Command towards greater emphasis on selective bombing, an effort that proved not entirely successful. Whilst resisting Air Staff pressure and persisting in his general area offensive, Air Chief Marshal Harris nonetheless in May 1944 initiated a general drive on bombing accuracy. In June, Bomber Command began further experimentation with precision bombing by individual 'ordinary' (non-Pathfinder) squadrons, with impressive results; these included day bombing attacks against tactical and 'Crossbow' targets during the summer of 1944. By the time Bomber Command and Eighth Air Force could return to a strategic offensive against Germany in the autumn of 1944, Bomber Command's abilities to execute night-time and daylight precision attacks had been estab1ished.36 Autumn 1944: The Re
