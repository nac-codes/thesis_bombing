could return to a strategic offensive against Germany in the autumn of 1944, Bomber Command's abilities to execute night-time and daylight precision attacks had been estab1ished.36 Autumn 1944: The Real Combined Bomber Offensive Originally the Combined Bomber Offensive was to precede the Allied invasion of Europe. By necessity that sequence was reversed. Although bombing had occurred in the name of the Combined Bomber Offensive, the real strategic offensive against Germany did not commence until General Eisenhower released the heavy bomber forces from Supreme Allied  File: --- parks_preciscion.pdf --- Page 17 --- 'PRECISION' AND 'AREA' BOMBING 161 Command control on 14 September 1944. The period from then until the end of 1944 offers the best comparison of bombing accuracy between the two air forces. These were mature forces; bomber forces were able to operate with long-range fighter escort and/or air superiority, minimising the distracting effect on bombing accuracy of enemy fighters; and while Harris continued to place undue emphasis on general area attacks, both forces engaged in selective attack of some of the same targets. US heavy bomber operations against Germany between September and December 1944 emphasised attacks on oil and transportation targets, including marshalling yards. Bomber Command continued to focus on German cities, with 53 per cent of its effort devoted to area attacks upon large industrial cities -in large measure due to Harris' continued faith in the general area offensive, partly in acknowledgement of how adverse weather hindered precision attack accuracy. The balance was devoted to various strategic and tactical targets: 14 per cent was directed at oil targets, 15 per cent at railways and canals, 13 per cent at support for allied ground forces, and 5 per cent at naval targets and miscellaneous objectives. RAF missions against oil and transportation targets were executed both at night and during the day as precision rather than area attacks
