, and 5 per cent at naval targets and miscellaneous objectives. RAF missions against oil and transportation targets were executed both at night and during the day as precision rather than area attacks. The night or adverse weather precision attack capabilities that Bomber Command had developed over the preceding 18 months paid dividends on more than one occasion; at times No.3 Group (employing Gee-H) was the only Allied air element capable of supporting Allied ground forces through the bad weather during the Ardennes counter-offensive. 37 Bomber Command improved its performance quantitatively and qualita­ tively. Between April 1943 and April 1945 the sortie rate experienced a three and a half-fold increase, while accuracy increased threefold. In April 1943, 30 per cent of the bombs fell within three miles of the aiming point, com­ pared to 90 per cent two years later. Together, there was a tenfold increase in performance. Accuracy was not as great as it had been in its attacks on lightly defended targets in France and the Low Countries, being affected by flak density and a commensurate altitude increase, but greatly improved over 1943 performances.'" The method of attack for the Eighth Air Force during the period from 31 September to 1 December 1944, varied, but remained heavily dependent upon non-visual bombing aids, and H2S in particular:'"  File: --- parks_preciscion.pdf --- Page 18 --- 162 AIRPOWER: THEORY AND PRACTICE TABLE 4 US EIGHTH AIR FORCE I SEPT-31 DEC 1944 Bombing Method Per Cent of or Condition Total Effort H2X-10/10 cloud 35} H2X-8-9/10 cloud 15} H2X-6-7/10cloud 5} H2X-4-5/10 cloud 3} Micro-H 3} Gee-H 15} Visual-poor visibility 10 Visual -fair to good visibility 14 Total Per Cent Non-Visual 76 US bombing accuracy using H2X through 10/10 could fall off significantly: only 0.2 per cent of bombs fell within 1,000 feet of the assigned aiming point.
