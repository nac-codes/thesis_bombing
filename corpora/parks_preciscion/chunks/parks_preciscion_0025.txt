As indicated by Figure 4 and the following, American accuracy for attacks on synthetic oil targets during the oil offensive was not high:44 TABLE 5 US BOMBING OF GERMAN SYNTHETIC OIL TARGETS MAY 1944 -APRIL 1945 Tons Estimated to Have Estimated Total Tons Dropped Hit Within Plant Fences PerCent of Hits 1944 May 2,509 673 26.8 June 5,095 966 19.0 July 10,459 1,698 16.2 August 8,858 2,080 23.5 September 11,668 1,698 14.6 October 8,737 1,360 15.6 November 23,922 2,883 12.1 December 12,312 1,516 12.3 1945 January 9,754 1,479 15.2 February 14,114 2,282 16.2 March 12,909 1,880 14.6 April 3,249 514 15.8 TOTAL 123,586 19,029 15.4 As enemy defences declined, USAAF (visual bombing accuracy improved (Figure 5).45 For the period 1 January 1944 to April 1945, Eighth Air Force heavy bombers bombing visually placed 31.8 per cent of their bombs within 1 ,000 feet of their aiming point, while Fifteenth Air Force averaged 30.78 per cent.46 American blind-bombing accuracy showed no improvement during 1944 and 1945, and the bombing of oil targets by visual and nonvisual means was particularly poor. An Eighth Air Force analysis of seven H2X operations against the I.G. Farbenindustrie synthetic oil facility at Ludwigshafen­ Mannheim during September 1944 is illustrative. Bombing on four of the days was through 10/10 cloud, while at least part of the bombing on the other three days was conducted under conditions of 6/10 to 9/10 cloud. The report determined that a disturbingly high proportional of
