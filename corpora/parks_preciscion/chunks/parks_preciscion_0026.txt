was through 10/10 cloud, while at least part of the bombing on the other three days was conducted under conditions of 6/10 to 9/10 cloud. The report determined that a disturbingly high proportional of the attacks failed to reach the general area of the target; of 186 formations dispatched to the target, the bombfalls of only 80 -less than half -could be identified. On days of 10/10 cloud, approximately 20 per cent of the bombers found the target; on days of partial visibility, approximately 70 per cent of the bomb falls could be identified in the target area.

Nazi Minister of Armaments and Production Albert Speer reported on 19 January 1945, that 'the [RAF] attacks ... are considerably more effective than daylight [US] attacks, since heavier bombs are used and an extraordinary accuracy in attacking the target is reported. '48 The US Strategic Bombing Survey analysis of British and American bombing of three oil plants (Leuna, Ludwigshafen-Oppau, and Zeitz) revealed the following comparison of the accuracy of the two forces:•• TABLE 7 ALLIED ATTACKS ON THREE SYNTHETIC OIL PLANTS Total Tons of Tons of Bombs Type of Aiming Bombs Dropped Hitting Plant Per Cent of Hits Eighth AF, Visual 3,993 1,069 26.8 Eighth AF, Part Visual 4,553 556 12.4 Part Instrument Eighth AF, Full Instrument 11,870 641 5.4 RAF Night Pathfinder techniq
