Americans performance suffered significantly when faced with adverse weather, to which it failed to adjust during the war. RAF Bomber Command may have pursued its general area offensive longer than it should have, but its emphasis on H2X acquisition, individual crew training and mission  File: --- parks_preciscion.pdf --- Page 22 --- FIGURE 4 US BOMBING OF GERMAN SYNTHETIC OIL TARGETS MAY 1944-APRIL 1945 WHERE OUR BOMBS DROPPED: 100% ...... 0\ 0\ > ;;; ., 0 ~ m :;.1 ..., :z: m 0 :;.1 ....:: > z t:1 ., :;.1 > n j n m  File: --- parks_preciscion.pdf --- Page 23 --- 70% 60% 50% 40% ' 30% 20% 10% 0 FIGURE 5 EIGHTH AIR FORCE BOMBING ACCURACY / '\ -Percentage ~ ----of bombs I dropped within 1000' '\ ~ " y of aiming / [\ point I " \ Percentage ' v -----!.. ---of casualties ~ -- an-Mar Apr-Jun Jui-Sep Oct-Dec !Jan-Mar Apr-Jun Jui-Scp Oct-DecJ Jan-Mar I 1943 1944 1945- Source: British Bombing Survey Unit, The Strategic Air War Against Germany I "0 ~ tTl n -CJ) -0 z >­z 0 >­ ~ tTl >- ttl 0 2::: ttl -z Cl ,_. 0'\ --J  File: --- parks_preciscion.pdf --- Page 24 --- 168 AIRPOWER: THEORY AND PRACTICE performance paid dividends when it attacked selective targets at night or at times of limited visibility conditions. The USAAF's daylight visual bombing was neither five nor ten times more accurate than the best of RAF Bomber Command's night-time attacks, nor as accurate as the latter under limited visibility -which was the majority of the time. Conclusion One cannot help but speculate on why the USAAF leadership went so far
