Each was subject to operational constraints, not the least of which were the tenacity of the German air defences and the vagaries of weather. The crews of each risked their lives, day after day, or night after night, and many paid the supreme sacrifice. Over a half century after those efforts, however, the record merits reassessment. Examination of the data reveals that, when Bomber Command and the USAAF were mature, full-strength forces, and when Bomber Command could be enticed away from its area offensive, the difference in theirbombing accuracy was not as great as generally has been held to have been the case.
