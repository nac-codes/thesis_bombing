In a 27 May 1944 US Strategic Air Forces in Europe report on bombing accuracy to the CG, Army Air Forces reported that 'about 30 per cent of our formation attacks fail to attack assigned targets and attack targets of opportunity instead.' When attacking the assigned target, aircraft bombing from 20,000 ft resulted in a gross error rate of 30 per cent. 'CEP for Heavy and Medium Bomba
