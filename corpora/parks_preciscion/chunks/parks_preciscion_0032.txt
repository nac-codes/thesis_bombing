The higher US abort rate was a result of its formation flying, which could be adversely affected by weather throughout the mission -at base, takeoff, rendezvous and assembly, enroute, at the target and on landing. Formation flying restricted the ability of a force to penetrate cloudy weather at flight levels. 'Safe flying weather' for US crews in Europe was defined by commanders after assessing equipment limitations, tactics, operational priority and state of crew traini
