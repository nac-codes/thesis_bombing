s detailed analysis of 12 target categories, including indus­ trial areas (to include urban areas). USSBS Report 63 (Bombing Accuracy) does not include industrial areas as a target category, apparently because of the Feb. 1945 recharacterisation of industrial areas as marshalling yards. 20.

This must be assiduously guarded against in connection with 'through the overcast' bombing. Our experience to date with this type of bombing technique indicates that it is closely allied with area bombing and does not lend itself to the precision bombing of pinpoint targets. We have not been able, with regulari­ ty, to take out precision targets using Oboe, GH or H2X. On those occasions when we have hit a precision target it has been largely luck. Ordinarily bombs are scattered over at least ten times as much area as with visual bombing ... Odishaw (note 5), p.97, indicates that operational analysis revealed that to attain an equivalent concentration of bombs within a circular area having a radius of I ,OOOft, an
