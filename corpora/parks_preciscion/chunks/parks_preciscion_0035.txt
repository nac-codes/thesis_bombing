with visual bombing ... Odishaw (note 5), p.97, indicates that operational analysis revealed that to attain an equivalent concentration of bombs within a circular area having a radius of I ,OOOft, an Eighth Air Force H2X force operating under 10/10 cloud conditions had to be approximately 150 times larger than a visual force bombing on a clear day. 25.

In summer 1944 Eighth Air Force ran H2X tests in part to 'determine the capabilities of the equipment under controlled conditions ... ' The study concluded that H2X was an effective instrument against 'appropriate targets, namely city areas or isolated industrial complexes. The experiment emphasises, however, that the chance of hitting a pre-assigned industrial target within the built-up areas of a city is extremely slight with any reasonable size force' [emphasis supplied].

USAF officers with radar bombing experience confim1ed to the author that this capability did not exist until more than a quarter century after World War II. 27. Ma
