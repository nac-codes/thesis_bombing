Washington scepticism prevailed despite the urgings of Gen. Spaatz. In a letter dated 14 Jan. 1944 Spaatz stated that 'The most critical need of the Strategic Air Forces is for more Pathfinder aircraft. A few H2X airplanes now will profit our cause more than several hundred in six months.' Spaatz Papers, Eighth Air Force file, 1942-45, Library of Congress, MS Div. Blind bombing equipÂ­ ment (H2X) was essential to maintaining a low rate of complete abortives under the policy requiring a high rate of operations.

The Eighth Air Force practice of equipping Pathfinder aircraft only with H2X contrasts with RAP Bomber Command H2S use. Commencing 21 Feb. 1943, Bomber Command proceeded to equip its entire heavy  File: --- parks_preciscion.pdf --- Page 28 --- 172 AIRPOWER: THEORY AND PRACTICE bomber force with H2S, i.e., all Lancaster (Pathfinder and non-Pathfinder) aircraft other than those equipped to carry the 8,000-lb bomb, all Halifax aircraft, and Mosquito Pathfinder and target-marking aircraft. Lancasters carrying the 8,000-lb bomb could not utilize H2S because the rotating antenna could not be fitted due to the modified bomb bay and bomb doors. Saward, Bomber's Eye (note 28), p.191; C.
