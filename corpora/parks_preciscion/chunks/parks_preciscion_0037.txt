Comparing 12 H2X aircraft per US heavy bomber group (Guerlac, p.813) with RAF Bomber Command operational strength in Dec. 1944 (excluding No.IOO Group and Oboe Mosquitoes) of 1,810 aircraft, and appreciating that all of the other 160 Mosquitoes were not H2S equipped, US H2X acquisition effort was roughly one-half that of Bomber Command (RAF Bomber Command strength from 'Air Ministry War Room Monthly Summary of Bomber Command Operations, December 1944', p.27, AHB, MoD, London). By the time Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces had equipped their Pathfinder forces, however, RAF Bomber Command crews had more than a year's operaÂ­ tional experience in H2S use. 31.

The Operational Research Section reported that while 'the exact number of gross errors is not known, the evidence indicates it is not negligible.' For example, on one mission 42 squadrons were dispatched to Ludwigshafen. One-half of the force misidentified check points and bombed Stuttgart; Odishaw (note 5), p.99. Likewise, on the 3 Feb. 1945 Eighth Air Force raid on Berlin, some groups missed the 883 sq. miles of Berlin completely. Davis (note 8), p.553. 33.
