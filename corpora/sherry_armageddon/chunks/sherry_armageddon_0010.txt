lt city centers do remind, in passing, that something else once stood there. Other testimony may be exhumed some day in archeological digs uncovering the unexploded bomb or the foundation of some forgotten building. An astonishing sign of human capacity to recover, the disappearance of the traces of aerial warfare parallels the passing of vivid recollection. As John Hersey noted in 1985 about Kiyoshi Tanimoto, one of Hiroshima’s survivors: “His memory, like the world’s, was getting spotty.”!  This book is primarily an explanation, not a remembrance, of the rise of strategic air war. But fragile remembrance today follows naturally from two of my major themes: the profound difficulties people faced in comprehending air war even as it unfolded, and the manner in which thinking about bombing before August 6, 1945, has shaped attitudes and approaches to the nuclear question. Almost as soon as Hiroshima was destroyed, the reflex reaction of most observers was to regard the atomic age as revolutionary and the previous history of air war as irrelevant, just as earlier commentators on the bomber tended to dismiss the previous history of warfare. In both cases, declarations of the past’s irrelevance masked the persistence of old habits. This book examines that persistence, showing how ideas about air war, and indeed the habit of regarding bombing as an abstract idea, developed in the prenuclear era and persisted beyond it. In that regard, an inability to im- agine in the 1980s what it was like in Berlin, Tokyo, or Hiroshima in 1945 reflects a recurrent and disturbing quality in all modern thinking about aerial warfare.  The title of this book refers to three related developments in aerial warfare: the creation of an apocalyptic mentality, consisting of expectations of ultimate danger and destruction that were both frightening and reassuring; the creation of the apparatus for realizing that danger; and the creation of the modern nuclear dilemma. For the most part, the last is
