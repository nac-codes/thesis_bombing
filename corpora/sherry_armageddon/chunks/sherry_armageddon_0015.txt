ways familiar from the later evolution of nuclear and space technology. Thus, an understanding of American air power and of the problem of aerial warfare can be achieved only in the context of cultural and intellectual history. The ways people have thought about air power proved so remarkably consistent, despite rapidly changing technology over a half-century, that a mere recital of a particular invention or an individual bombing raid sheds little light on the appeals and uses of air power. The bomber in imagination is the most compelling and revealing story.  A history of American air power might be written from other perspectives—tactics, technologies, organizations, and campaigns—some of which are already well developed by other writers. After all, ideas about air power did not evolve wholly apart from tangible developments. Practical limitations imposed sharp restraints on the translation of ideas into action, often more so than statesmen or warriors initially realized. Because that was so, my account necessarily becomes lengthier and more complex once it reaches World War II; the simplicity of war possible in imagination diminished in execution. The interplay of ideas and actions, theory and technology, dreams and deeds constitutes a significant focus of this account. But I emphasize that practical developments were usually secondary to imagination in shaping strategic air war.  At the same time, to treat bombing simply as an abstraction—as a strategy or horrible fantasy or set of statistics—would be to repeat a persistent error in a halfcentury’s preoccupation with the  Location 98 of 12433 1%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  AUUL UCLaUcs aLLeL LUE CHU UL WWULIU Wa 4, VISLULE LEMUUUCLS UL LS UULUIUEL © UCOLLUCUVELIESS GLE LEW, All ULLASLULE LICLIULUeL LU LUE VACUO UL UULUULUs UL a LUC UUs (LUE WNaloes VV AUeLLL Church in West Berlin and the Peace Memorial in Hiroshima) preserved as testimony to wartime devastation.
