uff of much military history, in the end it is more instructive to trace what diverse groups had in common as they thought about and practiced aerial warfare.  Some readers may also find my explanation of American war-making unduly or unfairly critical, especially in its suggestion of how racist attitudes and assumptions helped shape the bombing campaign against Japan. As the inevitably skeptical question puts it: if Americans were racist in incinerating Japanese cities, then how can one explain Britain’s firebombing of Hamburg and Dresden? The answer, it seems to me, is relatively simple: similar consequences can arise out of different motives and impulses. Of course, British and American bombing had much in common as well, but Japanese-American racial antagonisms added special fuel to the combustible mix of wartime motives for bombing. By the same token, racism was hardly the only impulse behind American bombing: I suggest that among policymakers, if not in the public at large, a technological fanaticism often governed actions, an approach to making war in which satisfaction of organizational and professional drives loomed larger than the overt passions of war.

After all, ideas about air power did not evolve wholly apart from tangible developments. Practical limitations imposed sharp restraints on the translation of ideas into action, often more so than statesmen or warriors initially realized. Because that was so, my account necessarily becomes lengthier and more complex once it reaches World
