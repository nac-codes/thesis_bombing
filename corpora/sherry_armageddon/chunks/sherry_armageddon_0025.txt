By the same token, racism was hardly the only impulse behind American bombing: I suggest that among policymakers, if not in the public at large, a technological fanaticism often governed actions, an approach to making war in which satisfaction of organizational and professional drives loomed larger than the overt passions of war.  The methods I have employed in researching and writing this story are familiar ones. A large literature of published sources is available. At many points I have also drawn heavily from archival sources, although they are often exasperatingly uneven in quality and quantity. My use of oral history, a popular technique in recent decades, has been limited. I have followed chronology in a broad way, but I sometimes set it aside to characterize certain moods, ideas, and practices that defy precise chronological placement.  Above all, I have emphasized the diversity of the appeals that air power has had for Americans. The result is a somewhat eclectic explanation of how Americans came to embrace strategic bombing, but this is deliberate, for it is important not to see the bomber as satisfying merely the needs of particular interest groups
