years of technological development capped by the Wright brothers’ first powered flight in 1903. Moreover, this literature flourished in the context of an explosive growth in other military technologies and in the acquisition of armaments, armies, and navies by the world’s major powers.  Throughout the period, military uses for aircraft were hardly unforeseen. More than any other modern weapon, the bomber was imagined before it was invented. In a century of primitive experiments with balloons and then with dirigibles, nearly every claim later advanced by strategists of air war was already mentioned. After 1900, the first demonstrations of heavier-than-air craft usually had unmistakable military implications, or took place in public view of governments’ interest in those implications. They were obvious to Europeans after the first flights across the English Channel. In the United States, the initial wave of publicity regarding the airplane as a practical machine came in 1908, when the Wright brothers demonstrated their invention over the capital for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. For days, thousands watched in awe at the miracle of flight, and the event stirred lavish predictions about how the airplane would change the affairs of the nation and human- kind. That event, like others, precipitated little foreboding. Even when prophets detected dangers, they usually converted them into virtues.
