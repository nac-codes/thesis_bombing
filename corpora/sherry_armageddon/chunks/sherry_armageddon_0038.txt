whole new dimension in human activity. Therefore it was uniquely capable of stimulating fantasies of peacetime possibilities for lifting worldly burdens, transforming man’s sense of time and space, transcending geography, knitting together nations and peoples, releasing humankind from its biological limits. Flight also resonated with the deepest impulses and symbols of religious and particularly Christian mythology—nothing less than Christ’s ascension. Its realization, then, served as a powerful meta- phor for heavenly aspirations and even, among the literal-minded, as the palpable vehicle for achieving them. Not surprisingly, prediction preceded innovation and ran far ahead of technology even after invention occurred.  As metaphor for so many human aspirations, flight stimulated fantasies that were by no means consistently positive. In prehistory, in ancient cultures yielding legends like that of Icarus, in Da Vinci’s work on flying machines, in the hysterical reactions of Parisian crowds to the first balloon ascents, and in the outpouring of predictive literature at the close of the nineteenth century, flight had seemed both dangerous and attractive, symbol of vision and arrogance. Likewise with speculation about the impact of flight upon warfare. Eighteenth-century Parisians imagined “our cities in fire, our harvests ravaged, our fortresses destroyed,” even their wives and daughters ravished by “lovers and thieves descending our chimneys.” Manned flight suggested a wide range of wartime possibil- ities on which dreamers could speculate and over which, once flying became a reality, men and women would argue.  The variety of these conflicting images of danger and promise made the airplane harder to ignore than other prospective weapons, made thinking about it more complex, and made its development more difficult to trace. In breadth of impact on humankind, especially in capacity to stir the imagination, only the railroad and the steamship approached the airplane,
