or a practical but pedestrian aid to armies and navies. But these predictions provided counterpoint, not corrective, to the faith that, in the modern world, “the greatest destroyer is the greatest philanthropist.”8  That faith was perhaps not so naive as later generations often thought. The prophets of peace recognized the destructiveness of modern weaponry, so much so that faith in peace became a necessity, not just the product of complacent idealism. The alternative was to face terrors too awesome to contemplate. Altering international rules first laid down in 1899, the Hague Conference of 1907 banned “bombardment, by whatever means” of “undefended” cities and structures, but prohibition alone provided scant comfort.2 Elaborate international agreements and diverse peace move- ments rested in part upon regarding the machine gun and the bomber as yet another sign of man’s progress.  Their proponents tried gamely to place such weapons in service to higher goals. They saw preparedness as compatible with peace, not primarily because new weapons would deter aggressors, but because they would deter or shorten war itself by making it too horrible for intelligent citizens to entertain or endure. It therefore seemed plausible for an American politician to urge that the way “to lessen human warfare” was to “cultivate the highest chemistry and make the most deadly armament.” War might not disappear altogether—historical experience as well as gleanings from Darwin made that seem unlikely, just as confidence in the efficacy of some types of war made it seem undesirable. Still, it might be shortened, humanized, or confined to inferior peoples for whom it served as an agent of progress. If so, Europeans could still, in Clarke’s words, “have their wars and enjoy them.”!2  War itself was not unthinkable, only endless and meaningless war. Far from ignoring new weapons, the prewar generation often exaggerated their destructiveness in order to assert their power to compel peace. Sent
