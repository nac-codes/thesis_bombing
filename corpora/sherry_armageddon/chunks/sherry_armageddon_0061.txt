on their comfortable assumptions about Western civilization, Wells drew on his fundamental pessimism about it. For him, the airplane was the logical product of the thoughtless militarism of the time, the lazy faith in the certainty of progress, and the “destructive scramble” of the great powers to extend their “economic ex- ploitation.” Likewise, the bomber could topple that civilization not just because it could kill and destroy, but because it would rip apart its economic and political fabric. Political convulsion, economic chaos, famine, and pestilence would be the real sources of civilization’s collapse. Death and destruction by bombing would only be their catalysts. Wells’s nightmare vision succeeded in part because he alone saw air war in its broadest context, as both the product and the downfall of Western civilization.14  Wells also had a subtler appreciation of nationalism and crowd psychology. He took the emerging notion of a knockout aerial blow to the national will and gave it a new and dismaying twist.

Such demonstrations were now the responsibility of the nation itself, as it resolved to mobilize huge resources and dared to risk destruction. In that bleak vision, the agencies of destruction were new and impersonal, but at least traditional values remained useful.  It was also possible to disassociate war technology from war itself, s
