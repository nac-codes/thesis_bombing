tself. Predictions about air war were too few, too inchoate, and too remote from immediate dangers to allow an argument about its future to be fully joined.  The extremes of hope for the warplane’s capacity to revolutionize warfare and offhand dismissal of its importance defined not so much a spectrum of opinion as a chasm of less emotionally satisfying possibilities that few people could explore. Those who thought about the future of air war—rarely the statesmen or generals who would later make the decisions—had few alternatives from which to choose. They were told that terror from the sky would eliminate the burden of carnage on the ground and costly armadas at sea by shocking armies and nations into quick surrender and perhaps even into a permanent peace. Or they could take comfort in the assurance that the airplane would scarcely change warfare at all, serving only to improve observation and communication (as balloons were already doing) or to add a bit of firepower to the battlefield.  Only one man located the grimmer terrain between these polarized possibilities. To be sure, H. G. Wells could not always resist the pull of extravagant hopes for the airplane. In The World Set Free (1914) Wells showed mankind awakening to the necessity of a world government to rescue it from total war, although only after so many years of global destruction by air that the fantasy was at best bleakly utopian. And The World Set Free was Wells’s weaker prophecy, more striking for its forecast of atomic bombs and radioactive poisoning than for its insight into the evolution of air war.  The War in the Air (1908) was at once more apocalyptic and more realistic. A war begun by German air raids on American cities expands into a global struggle in which the Asiatic nations prove as adept as Europeans in the arts of destruction from the skies. The Asiatics are no more successful in gaining a decision, however, and the world plunges into “a universal guerrilla war” from which there is no
