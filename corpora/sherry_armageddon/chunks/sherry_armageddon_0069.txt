n Wells could not fully capture. His own penchant for apocalyptic visions did not allow him to consider whether nations might learn to live, however badly, with this new weapon, harnessing it to older forms of warfare, but neither abolishing it as he urged nor succumbing to all its dangers as he feared.  Still, Wells rose above his contemporaries by recognizing the complexities of the new weapon, by rejecting a simple choice between the trivial and the millennial predictions that others made, and by exploring that chasm between them. He tried to see the warplane as a horrid but limited weapon, neither unthinkable nor blessed. Coming from a writer of international fame and influence, his warning did not go unnoticed. It also changed the prevailing outlook very little.  FANTASY AND IMPROVISATION  Although visions like Wells’s revealed contemporary expectations, they did little to guide the practical development of military aviation in its first years. That development derived from technical and tactical improvisations connected only loosely to the larger visions. Speculation about the warplane usually came from those who had little to do with invention, from poets and futurists and politicians. When generals, aviators, and technicians began toying with the warplane before World War I, they improvised both technology and doctrine, often indifferent toward grander prophecies, though sometimes goaded into action by the politicians and pundits who mouthed them.  Scientists and inventors provided little guidance. The Wright brothers had no great scheme for employing warplanes when they began securing military contracts in Europe and, after a rebuff, in America. Concerned with the patent and financial issues raised by those contracts, they pondered its military utility only passingly. They knew that the airplane’s initial use would be military. But they were naive about their power to control that use, slow to see any role for the plane beyond observation and quick to calm
