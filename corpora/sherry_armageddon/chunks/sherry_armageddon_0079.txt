ons for their planes. Neither before nor during World War I did the navy do much with these possibilities, limit- ing its aviation largely to reconnaissance and coastal defense.?!  Before World War I, then, military aviation was hardly more than a casual improvisation, even in Europe, where popular fears of doomsday occasionally prompted hurried efforts to build warplanes. On the eve of World War I, the major powers could each claim only about fifty to one hundred planes, none ready to fight. “In fact,” as Robin Higham succintly put it, “exactly what they were there for was not very clear.”22 Success in military aviation had less to do with national talents or needs than with the accidents of war. The Germans were developing dirigibles whose potential for bombing intrigued them and alarmed the British. But the Italians led in aviation because their war with the Turks in 1911-12 accelerated their aviation program. They carried out the first bombing operations since Austrian balloonists tossed a few explosives on Venice in 1849. The Italians’ effort also prompted the first moral controversy over a bombing incident. But the Italians did not become a major air power, although their effort was impressive until the start of World War II. The American armed forces, eventually to be supreme in the air, numbered their planes and pilots in the dozens, spent a pittance on aviation compared to other major powers, and by 1914 had lost whatever lead they earlier held. Whatever the deeper national needs or traits that eventually fostered American supremacy—such as a knack for technology or a fondness for inexpensive and decisive victories—they were not much in evidence before World War I. Americans showed no special rush to develop warplanes, no peculiar interest or talent that matched or exceeded that of other major powers.  Historians sometimes list the factors that retarded the development of military aviation in the United States and abroad—the primitiveness of technology and
