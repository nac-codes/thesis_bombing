d or exceeded that of other major powers.  Historians sometimes list the factors that retarded the development of military aviation in the United States and abroad—the primitiveness of technology and the unpredictability of its development, the resistance of military bureaucracies to change and the paucity of institutional mechanisms to promote it, the lack of urgency about national security and the preoccupation with naval armaments. Undoubtedly such forces were at work. Yet merely to recite them is to suggest that somehow Progress should have come more quickly. There was no reason that it should have.

Thus the pace of technological progress governed the warplane’s development, not because men were somehow driven by its sheer force, but in part be- cause they abdicated responsibility to it.17  The reticence of the airplane’s inventors about its moral and strategic implications did not stem from lack of sophistication. Far from being the “folklore technologists” that myth sometimes made them out to be, they succeeded because they appreciated the scientific method, participated in an embryonic community of aeronautical experts, knew the virtues of institutionalized research, and recognized that only government could offer them capital and a market.18 But as theorists and moralists of war, they had little to suggest. They offered only the raw materials which, as Elting Morison has commented regarding the navy, “were brought into successful combination by minds not interested in the instruments for themselves but in what they could do for them.”!° Only a later generation of scientists sometimes felt su
