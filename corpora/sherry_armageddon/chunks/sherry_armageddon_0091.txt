Austrians and Italians traded notably punishing blows against cities. The French, wary of setting the wrong precedent for German bombers, generally confined their large effort to attacks on military and industrial targets. But by war’s end, bombs had hit every capital of the warring European powers except Rome, and rumors of impending attack even darkened cities in eastern Canada and the United States.  The Zeppelin raids of 1915 marked the decisive turn. Motivated partly by rivalries and ambitions within the military, they were pressed by officers on a civilian leadership with sentimental, moral, and political qualms about bombing. The kaiser, worried about the fate of his royal cousins in London and squeamish about the nastiness of modern war, reluctantly approved the bombing program only after getting assurances that “historic buildings and private property will be spared as much as possible,” stipulations that neither the state of the art nor the desires of officers could long respect. Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg feared that unrestricted war, in the air as on the seas, might make “a very unfavourable impression on foreign neutrals, particularly in America.” He of course lost the argument.23  The case for bombing cities developed piecemeal. German commanders promised tangible rewards: raids on British cities would supposedly force the Allies to divert precious resources from France in order to defend England, giving the Germans an edge in the great battles on the western front. This promise was indeed partly realized. When cries of anguish and indignation in England forced the hand of authorities, they gradually assembled an impressive apparatus of air defense: hundreds of fighter aircraft, antiaircraft guns, barrage balloons, searchlights, sound detectors, and communications systems. An invaluable rehearsal for 1940, this effort offered few immediate benefits for the British. Weather, navigational difficulties, and mechanical break-downs did as much to slow the
