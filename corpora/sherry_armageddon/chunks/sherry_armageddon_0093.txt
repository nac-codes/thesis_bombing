is forging weapons against us.” In fact, it fell randomly, noisily, but hardly mercilessly. Results were occasionally spectacular, especially when German bombers struck in darkness, as the English air defense often forced them to do. On some nights, hundreds of thousands of Londoners streamed into the tubes and tunnels under their city, pro- duction in some key industries was disrupted, and even David Lloyd George himself, who “lacked physical courage,” fled the city.25  English terror mirrored German hopes. It was undoubtedly not just a response to the scale of the raids, each of which, as one observer commented, hardly compared to “a before-breakfast skirmish almost any morning on the Somme,” and which together inflicted some fourteen hundred English fatalities during the war. Terror sprang from the unpredictability of the raids as wellas from shock over the violation of accepted standards of war, a response possible only for a generation that ignored the long record of horrors in centuries of wars.26  Contemporaries as well as later observers exaggerated the extent and importance of the panic in England. Panic existed, perhaps more in the government than in the people themselves, as Wells predicted; but so too did a “stiffening of morale.” The Daily Mail captured the popular response when it boasted that the Germans “imagine that by a wicked, purposeless act of murder... they can frighten the British people. ... The only result in England is to remind us that the German is a Hun.”27  Despite mixed results, some Germans hoped that the attack on English morale would yield an even greater return. Bombing English cities might provide “a basis for peace” by diminishing the enemy’s “will” to wage war. Convinced of the “well-known nervousness of the [English] public” and skeptical that England was truly committed to the war effort, they believed that bombing might knock her altogether out of the war.28  It did not, of course, and in the end Germany abandoned strategic
