The German is susceptible to bloodi- ness, and I would not mind a few accidents due to inaccuracy.”22  Borrowing German practice, the British reversed Germany’s pattern of decision making: whereas officers overcame civilian reluctance in Germany, in England outraged civilians wore down the generals’ doubts about strategic bombing.

Results were occasionally spectacular, especially when German bombers struck in darkness, as the English air defense often forced them to do. On some nights, hundreds of thousands of Londoners streamed into the tubes and tunnels under their city, pro- duction in some key industries was disrupted, and even David Lloyd George himself, who “lacked physical courage,” fled the city.25  English terror mirrored German hopes. It was undoubtedly not just a response to the scale of the raids, each of which, as one observer commented, hardly compared to “a before-breakfast skirmish almost any morning on the Somme,” and which together inflicted some fourteen hundred English fatalities during the war. Terror sprang from the unpredictability of the raids as well as from shock over the violation of accepted standards of war, a response possible only for a generation that ignored the long record of horrors in centuries of wars.26
