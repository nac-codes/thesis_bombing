The German is susceptible to bloodi- ness, and I would not mind a few accidents due to inaccuracy.”22  Borrowing German practice, the British reversed Germany’s pattern of decision making: whereas officers overcame civilian reluctance in Germany, in England outraged civilians wore down the generals’ doubts about strategic bombing. But London echoed Berlin's strategic reasoning. “Conceptually,” one historian has said, “British insight was acquired at the receiving end of German bombs.” Now Allied bombing, it seemed, might sap the enemy’s strength on the front, deplete production, and unnerve the population. In Britain’s case, an additional impetus to bomb came from the apparent failure of the vaunted British navy to achieve a strategic breakthrough through blockade—hence the “first essays in strategic bombing on the British side were framed by the Royal Navy.” As in Germany, some doubts about strategic bombing arose in England. Like Bethmann-Hollweg, Churchill, though no opponent of bombing, questioned whether any “terrorization of the
