Only when German forces began faltering anyway could air power give the Allied armies a significant advantage in battle.  Warplanes, used in part in response to the futility of the offensive 4 outrance on the ground, were hurled into battle with the same offensive abandon. Good tactical reasons were advanced for so doing. It was pointed out that planes could not guard territory like isolated sentries on duty without being picked off one by one; they had to seek out the enemy and attack in force. And attack in force they did, as commanders like Trenchard sent hundreds of planes to battle: against the German spring offensive in 1918 the British expended over 1,000 of the 1,232 craft they had on hand at the start. About fifty-five thousand airmen met their death in the war—a negligible figure by the standards of ground combat, but an appalling loss rate given the size of the air forces involved. Leadership was partly the problem, for some air commanders were old infantry or cavalry officers baffled by these new machines. Others were young, too inexperienced to handle the large forces suddenly in their charge. They were forced to improvise tactics, ill-equipped to analyze results, and prone to make excessive claims for their weapon. Like other new weapons of the day, the airplane did little “except to increase the efficiency of the slaughter.”35 The battlefield may have been the most practical arena in which to employ the airplane. At the same time, it was also the least decisive because the stalemate on land was so massive, deeply determined, and resistant to change that whatever advantage superior aviation offered was insufficient to break it.  That alone perhaps argued for its strategic employment. Yet in that capacity too, air power could not sustain hopes that it would transcend the conditions and attitudes that prevailed in ground warfare. Commanders spent their aircraft in the same futile charges against the enemy. Even air defense against strategic bombing took
