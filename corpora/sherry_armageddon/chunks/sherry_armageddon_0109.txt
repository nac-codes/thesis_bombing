transcend the conditions and attitudes that prevailed in ground warfare. Commanders spent their aircraft in the same futile charges against the enemy. Even air defense against strategic bombing took an offensive form, guided by the assumption that real defense  Page 12 of 368 4%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON avoidance ana neatea denials OF the clergy’s concerns, or on rationalizations wnich betrayed troubled consciences. rassing Dows To legal and moral stanaaras at least Meant tnat they were Still lmpli-  cit elements in the moral calculations men made. “The lineaments of justice,” Michael Walzer has said, are suggested by “the unchanging character of the lies soldiers and statesmen tell.”33  Soldiers and statesmen often applied a practical test to moral issues. Bethmann-Hollweg begged that Germany avoid “irritating the chauvinistic and fanatical instincts of the English nation without cause.” Yet as Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz had already argued, what was indefensible if done “without cause” seemed justified if inflicted with sufficiently majestic force: “Single bombs from flying machines are wrong; they are odious when they hit and kill an old woman. . . . [But] if one could set fire to London in thirty places, then what in a small way is odious would retire before something fine and powerful. All that flies and creeps should be concentrated on that city.”34 Tirpitz’s twisted logic was not entirely irrelevant to the moral issue at hand. He, like other people in the war, did feel forced to make moral calculations about the relationship between ends and means. What limited their debate was partly the carelessness of those calculations.  The principal element in the moral case for strategic bombing was that it would rescue humanity from the horrors of stalemated, industrialized war, making conflict either so mercifully decisive or so mercilessly horrible that it could not continue. Bombing could not do this, however. Instead of breaking
