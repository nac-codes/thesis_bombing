little excited, but not in the least frightened.”48 Finding such reassurance and satisfaction, Americans looked away from the role of the warplane as an agent of destruction.  By November 1918, the bomber had found acceptance in both Britain and America. In Britain it inspired a lasting terror which left that nation determined to build a powerful strategic force and, even twenty years later, gave pause to Chamberlain at Munich. In America, it inspired casual fascination and easy hopes. For neither country was the test of war sufficient to challenge these  Page 17 of 368 5%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  suggested the outlines of an American debate never fully joined among INDI y inci ol aa Gd puoae ai age.

Isolated from the war, late to enter it, slow to bomb, and invulnerable themselves to attack, they took positions on the destruction of cities and industries without fear of consequence. Because attention focused on the production of bombers rather than on their purpose in war, hopes for bombing were left intact yet untested. Compared to European opinion on air war, American views were casual.  What informed those views was not so much the immediate fears and challenges of the war, but cultural traditions and anxieties which encouraged Americans to look “above the battle” and permitted them both to celebrate and to ignore new weapons like the bomber.*4 The Civil War had inspired an ennobling view of war that remained powerful even on the eve of World War I. War still seemed an opportunity more for individual heroism than for mass destruction. Anxieties about the debilitating effects of machine civilization—regimentation, materialism, class cleavages— strengthened the urge to embrace war with relief. “France,” David Kennedy has commented, “figures as kind of equivalent of Huck Finn’s ‘Territory,’ a place to light out to in flight from the artificial constraints of civili
