Neither American needs nor the brevity of American participation compelled the grim sense of impersonal and fu- tile destruction so deeply felt by Europeans.4=  In one sense, Americans realized this was a war of scientific destruction, and they organized to wage such a conflict, paying due attention to the contributions of scientists and other experts. Yet there were ways to reconcile the heroic impulse with impersonal realities. The very magnitude of the carnage was reassuring evidence “that miracles of heroism were possible in that decadent, commercial age.” Armies were engines of impersonal destruction, men “mere cogs,” yet men identified with the engines in a way that “turned the whole genre of attacks on technology on its head. Death through one’s own machines, which, since Marx’s early writings, had seemed the absurd extreme of alienation, now restored to the warriors a comfortable sense of themselves.”46  Similarly, the warplane embodied not so much a conflict between heroic traditions and machine-age anonymity, but a happy fusion of the two.
