peculation about the future of aviation, the two events signaled danger to a few observers but offered reassurance to most, particularly about how individualism could persist in the wake of mass war and in the midst of mass culture. The significance attached to the heroics of Mitchell and Lindbergh helps explain how the bomber became acceptable to Americans as an instrument of warfare. Though less forcefully than Europeans, they had learned from World War I how terrifying future aerial war might be. Yet in general their attrac- tion to the aerial weapon deepened in the 1920s.  It did so in part because it rarely had to be tested against visible or disturbing military realities. In both Europe and the United States, military aviation stagnated. A glut of aircraft left over from the war, tight purse strings in most national treasuries, and the absence of immediate enemies curbed investment in bomber design and purchase. In much of the British Empire and for American forces in Nicaragua the bomber proved a cheap way to inflict an imperial sting on obstreperous subjects. But for these operations, aircraft left over from World War I did nicely, and if raids in far- off lands provoked occasional cries of moral anguish, they hardly seemed like a rehearsal for modern air war. Development of military aviation did not altogether cease. In particular, the French maintained a huge air force in the twenties, the Italians made strides, British air officers honed their theory of strategic bombing, and American airmen pioneered in patrolling the seas. More generally, the aircraft carrier came of age. And indirectly or surreptitiously, all the great powers prepared the way for advances in military air power by promoting civil aviation. Simply because the greatest strides and the most glamorous feats came in the civilian field, however, there was reason to believe that aviation was following a pacific course and to ignore its more disturbing potential.
