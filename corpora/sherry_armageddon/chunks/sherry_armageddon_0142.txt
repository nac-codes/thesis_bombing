do this swiftly. “Aircraft enables us to jump over the army which shields the enemy government, industry and people, and so strike direct and immediately at the seat of the opposing will and policy.” Or, as Douhet put it, “Now it is actually populations and nations,” rather than their agents, “which come to blows and seize each other’s throats.”2  Prophets of aerial apocalypse in the 1920s displayed remarkable unanimity in imagining how the bombers would do their job. Flying in numbers and with bomb loads unimaginable in World War I, fleets of aerial dreadnoughts would strike in the first hours of war, perhaps even before any declaration of war, and rain tons of explosive, incendiary, and gas or bacteriological bombs on an en- emy’s metropolitan centers. J. F. C. Fuller, the other major British proponent of new forms of warfare, asked his readers to  picture, if you can, what the result will be: London for several days will be one vast raving Bedlam, the hospitals will be stormed, traffic will cease, the homeless will shriek for help, the city will be in pande- monium. What of the government at Westminster? It will be swept away by an avalanche of terror. Then will the enemy dictate his terms, which will be grasped at like a straw by a drowning man. Thus may a war be won in forty-eight hours and the losses of the winning side may be actually nil!3  Scenarios rarely ran to much more detail than this austere sequence of attack, panic, and collapse.  After all, the prophets could foresee no real battle to describe. Armies and navies would do little more than guard borders and coastlines. In the air, most military experts agreed, defense against bombers was virtually impossible. Their speed, mobility, fire-power, and numbers would overwhelm defending fighters and antiaircraft artillery, which would do little more than shoot blindly, especially when bombers struck at night or when they attacked far from their targets by launching aerial “torpedoes” about which the 1920s
