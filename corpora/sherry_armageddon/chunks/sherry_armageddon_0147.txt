he benefits of aerochemical warfare was a minority view. Yet even an apocalyptic view of airborne gas warfare also strengthened claims for its decisiveness. Besides, the proponents of aerial bombing had other ways to address the moral issues it raised, shown by Hugh Trenchard’s tortured distinction between bombing “for the sole purpose of terrorising the civilian population” and bombing “to terrorise munition workers (men and women) into absenting themselves from work.” By and large, however, the moral case of the prophets rested only on their assertion that bombing would bring wars to mercifully speedy, if costly, conclusions. Since bombing was sure to be so frightful, its destructiveness aroused little worry—a terrorized populace would surrender before destruction proceeded far at all.©  Certainty about the bomber’s efficacy rested on an appreciation of new technology, but also on unquestioned belief in the fragility of modern societies. All the achievements in which Europe once gloried—material wealth, economic interdependence, sophisticated communications—now seemed cause for the gravest worry that the home front had become hopelessly vulnerable: “A nation’s nerve-system, no longer covered by the flesh of its troops, is now laid bare to attack, and, like the human nerves, the progress of civilization has rendered it far more sensitive than in earlier and more primitive times.” Repeated images of “nerve centers,” “vital centers,” and “nerve ganglia” reflected a pervasive sense of a fragile social organism. It derived from memories of panic in the streets and mutiny in the trenches during the war and from the myth (soon skillfully exploited by the Nazis) that Germany had collapsed from within without being defeated in the field. It also stemmed from the wartime discovery of man’s susceptibility to propaganda and manipulation, to the dark passions that Freud had uncovered. The new technology of mass communications, far from inducing confidence about a government’s
