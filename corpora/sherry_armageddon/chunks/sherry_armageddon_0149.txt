all by the disloyalty of an alienated working class.  Geography also made England's plight seem grave. The sea approaches to Britain made incoming bombers hard to detect and English cities easy to locate; German bases were close to London but Berlin was far from England’s bombers. Yet geography and technology were not the sole considerations in fearing a knockout blow, for anxieties deriving from World War I gave that fear depth and intensity. At the same time, memories of war’s horror magnified the bomber’s promise as well as its peril. “The more rapid and terrifying the arms are,” Douhet argued, “the faster they will reach vital centers and the more deeply they will affect moral resistance. Hence the more civilized war will become.” True, in the wake of World War I, the humanity of modern weapons was a tattered hope, not the confident proposition it had been. Reassurance often seemed lame, as in Douhet’s prediction that “cemeteries would undoubtedly grow larger, but not as large as they became before the peace signed at Versailles.” Air power would deliver such a “swift and sudden blow,” according to Liddell Hart, “that the ethical objection to this form of war is at least not greater than to the cannon-fodder wars of the past.” So strong was the revulsion to trench warfare, however, that the old promise of escape from familiar horrors through technology persisted. To discard it altogether would have con- demned Europeans to an unrelievedly grim view of the future. Faith in the future required belief in the finality of this new weapon.12  That belief also allowed contradictions in the air power prophecies to go unnoticed. The prophets proclaimed the revolutionary nature of their weapon, its capacity to transform warfare and to make history irrelevant. The past, in particular the bomber’s ambiguous record in the world war, taught “less than nothing,” Douhet announced. But the past still bound the prophets. They could not really imagine a future, except one crudely
