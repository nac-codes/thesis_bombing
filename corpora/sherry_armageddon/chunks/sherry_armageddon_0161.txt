In the reasoning of prophets like Mitchell, the bomber undermined the security of European nations, their capitals within such easy reach of enemy airplanes; but it might enhance America’s safety, if deployed to guard the nation’s oceanic moats.  That difference between European and American perspectives was more apparent than real, however. The bomber Mitchell wanted for striking into the Atlantic would have to approach, in range and size and accuracy, the aircraft capable of offensive missions against an enemy’s heartland. That certainly entered Mitchell’s calculations, for his oft-repeated sketches of American cities under aerial attack expressed, in thinly disguised form, opportunities he foresaw for American attack on foreign cities. In addition, European ideas of air power were familiar to American airmen, through personal contacts developed during the war and sometimes through reading what was written abroad. Liddell Hart’s Paris, for example, quickly found an audience in the United States Army  Page 26 of 368 7%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  Cangel.  Some observers argued that air war promised deliverance from the horrors of the trenches only by opening up “hideous vistas” of greater destruction. Churchill pronounced that the bomber gave mankind the means to “accomplish its own extinction.” Another Englishman rightly wondered if bombing would “smash the will to war. You may only harden it, intensify it.” Others feared that two combatants roughly equal in air strength might hesitate altogether to attack enemy cities, settling into an uneasy “balance of terrors” (to use a term introduced in the 1930s) or else descending into “the edifying spectacle of two nations hammering away at each other’s capital, with no immediate object but mutual destruction.” Of course, either outcome would upset the prophets’ calculations.1®  As the criticisms of aerial prophecy suggested, the twenties and thirties marked a shift away from the confiden
