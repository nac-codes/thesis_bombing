ogy also made American attack on Europe almost impossible, in that no American army could again cross the Atlantic in the face of some European enemy’s air power, but that was of little consequence to most Americans, opposed as they were to any repeat of the grand crusade of 1918. In the reasoning of prophets like Mitchell, the bomber undermined the security of European nations, their capitals within such easy reach of enemy airplanes; but it might enhance America’s safety, if deployed to guard the nation’s oceanic moats.  That difference between European and American perspectives was more apparent than real, however. The bomber Mitchell wanted for striking into the Atlantic would have to approach, in range and size and accuracy, the aircraft capable of offensive missions against an enemy’s heartland. That certainly entered Mitchell's calculations, for his oft-repeated sketches of American cities under aerial attack expressed, in thinly disguised form, opportunities he foresaw for American attack on foreign cities. In addition, European ideas of air power were familiar to American airmen, through personal contacts developed during the war and sometimes through reading what was written abroad. Liddell Hart’s Paris, for example, quickly found an audience in the United States Army Air Service. Mitchell sketched similar ideas in official memoranda and unpublished writings, in the polemics he published in the early twenties, and at greater length in 1925 in a Saturday Evening Post series and in Winged Defense.18  Like his counterparts in Europe, Mitchell confidently consigned ground forces to a secondary role and naval power (except submarines) to the deep sea of obsolescence. More baldly than his European contemporaries, he also proclaimed the humanity of aerial attack on enemy “vital centers.” Because bombing would democratize the horrors of war and inflict them so quickly, “either a state will hesitate to go to war, or, having engaged in war, [air power] will make the
