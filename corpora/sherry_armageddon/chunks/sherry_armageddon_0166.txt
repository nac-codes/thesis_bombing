ition of American needs in the air may also have stemmed from his modest definition of American interests. Global economic interests existed for the United States, he acknowledged; but having proclaimed the end of American “isolation,” he also asserted that “America could entirely dispense of her sea-going trade if she had to, and continue to exist and defend her- self,” a view that not all airmen shared.22  a ee a COE nee es PO 2 a Cc Pe | Cc ee re [er ee  Page 27 of 368 7%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  of the bomber’s role. American planes, roaming maritime approaches to the continent and smashing any sea or air armada that came close, promised to make attack upon America almost impossible. To be sure, the new aerial technology also made American attack on Europe almost impossible, in that no American army could again cross the Atlantic in the face of some European enemy’s air power, but that was of little consequence to most Americans, opposed as they were to any repeat of the grand crusade of 1918. In the reasoning of prophets like Mitchell, the bomber undermined the security of European nations, their capitals within such easy reach of enemy airplanes; but it might enhance America’s safety, if deployed to guard the nation’s oceanic moats.  That difference between European and American perspectives was more apparent than real, however. The bomber Mitchell wanted for striking into the Atlantic would have to approach, in range and size and accuracy, the aircraft capable of offensive missions against an enemy’s heartland. That certainly entered Mitchell's calculations, for his oft-repeated sketches of American cities under aerial attack expressed, in thinly disguised form, opportunities he foresaw for American attack on foreign cities. In addition, European ideas of air power were familiar to American airmen, through personal contacts developed during the war and sometimes through reading what was written abroad.
