addition, European ideas of air power were familiar to American airmen, through personal contacts developed during the war and sometimes through reading what was written abroad. Liddell Hart’s Paris, for example, quickly found an audience in the United States Army Air Service. Mitchell sketched similar ideas in official memoranda and unpublished writings, in the polemics he published in the early twenties, and at greater length in 1925 in a Saturday Evening Post series and in Winged Defense.18  Like his counterparts in Europe, Mitchell confidently consigned ground forces to a secondary role and naval power (except submarines) to the deep sea of obsolescence. More baldly than his European contemporaries, he also proclaimed the humanity of aerial attack on enemy “vital centers.” Because bombing would democratize the horrors of war and inflict them so quickly, “either a state will hesitate to go to war, or, having engaged in war, [air power] will make the context sharper, more decisive, and more quickly finished.” The passage from peril to reassurance was always jarringly sudden in Mitchell’s writings. Air power, he wrote in 1930,  is a distinct move for the betterment of civilization, because wars will be decided quickly and not drag on for years. What will the future hold for us? Undoubtedly an attack on the great centers of population. If a European country attacks the United States, New York, Chicago, Detroit, Pittsburgh and Washington-will be the first targets. It is unnecessary that these cities be destroyed in the sense that every house be levelled with the gound. It will be sufficient to have the civilian population driven out of them so that they cannot carry on their usual vocations. A few gas bombs will do that.  This “quick way of deciding a war,” he added, would be “really much more humane than the present methods of blowing up people to bits by cannon projectiles or butchering them with bayonets.”!2  Such reassurance was commonplace. “Jingoes,” wrote the
