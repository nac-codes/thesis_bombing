Japanese attack on America’s colony, the Philippine Islands. But there was almost a note of relish in his description of the course to be followed if deterrence failed. An American aerial offensive routed through Alaska and the North Pacific would be “decisive” because Japan’s cities were “congested” and built from “paper and wood or other inflammable structures.” The attractions of this “ideal target,” already worrisome to the Japanese, would be fully realized in twenty years. In the 1920s, however, the possibilities for air war against Japan rarely generated sus- tained public debate, even in the military, where Mitchell’s ideas circulated and apprehension of a Far Eastern war was widespread.23  Confusion in what military aviators claimed to expect of the bomber was in part attributable to their ambitions and intellects and to their fear of stating in public what they believed in private. But confusion also stemmed from broader circumstances. Airmen only reflected the difficulty the nation’s political leadership had in defining national interests and strategic needs. Moreover, aerial technology was developing too quickly to enable anyone to reach hard judgments on strategic possibilities. In this context, there was ample room for airmen to disagree, change their minds, or hold to contradictory ideas, especially when they were agitators first and theorists second. By mid-decade, Mitchell, among others, was moving beyond continental defense and tactical employment of air  power, but the process was incomplete. These pioneers believed that, given involvement in another world war, the United States might leap over the enemy’s conventional defenses and use the bomber tn “smash 11n his means of nraduction sunniv and transnortatian ” as Mitchell nut it in 1994 On occasion noliticians onenlv discissed the same nrasnects Yet most nrofessinnal airmen saw their  Page 27 of 368 7%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON ULELL LUE Lalipe Lie UCLEALEU SLU C
