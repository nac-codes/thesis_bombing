his popular book “The Next War”: An Appeal to Common Sense (1921), hinted at what the United States was capable of by stressing the American role in plans for bombing Germany in 1919 and in development of new and deadly forms of gas, about which Irwin shared the “near hysteria” of the decade.25 Irwin suggested that the next great war would sweep the United States into it and by implication into the practice of bombing cities. A layman who rivaled professional airmen in predictive capacities, he saw entire populations pitted against each other, their bombers launching gas attacks rendering a great capital city “in one night... changed from a metropolis to a necropolis.” In a passage borne out by the firestorms of World War II, he imagined how Paris could “suddenly become a superheated furnace ...the population struggling, piling up, shriveling with the heat . . . the survivors ranging the open fields in the condition of starving animals.” Most telling, he surpassed the professionals by capturing the psychic ease with which men could wage war by air. It “takes advantage of the limits of human imagination. If you bayonet a child, you see the spurt of blood, the curling up of the little body, the look in the eyes. ... But if you loose a bomb on a town, you see only that you have made a fair hit.” The “gallant” airmen he talked to during World War I “were thinking and talking not of the effects of their bombs but only of ‘the hit.” Beyond that, “they closed their imagination—as one must do in war.”26  But Irwin’s provocative tract triggered no extended debate about the efficacy or morality of American air power. In fact, it was not intended to, for Irwin’s concern was the abolition of war by international law and organization, not contemplation of how to wage it. At most, his book was an exception that proved the rule: in an era of self-proclaimed American isolation from Europe’s quar- rels, the apocalyptic visions of Europeans like Douhet and Liddell Hart found express
