entional defenses and use the bomber to “smash up his means of production, supply and transportation,” as Mitchell put it in 1924. On occasion, politicians openly discussed the same prospects. Yet most professional airmen saw their primary task as guarding the United States from attack, not striking across the oceans at its enemies. The theory of strategic air bombardment remained largely that, an attractive doctrine contem- plated at considerable psychological and geographical distance.24  Public debate early in the decade followed the same lines. The scarier prophecies coming out of Europe as well as similar American ideas received wide attention but usually in the context of what the war-mad European nations might do, rarely as something Americans might employ. Occasionally someone went further. Will Irwin, in his popular book “The Next War”: An Appeal to Common Sense (1921), hinted at what the United States was capable of by stressing the American role in plans for bombing Germany in 1919 and in development of new and deadly forms of gas, about which Irwin shared the “near hysteria” of the decade.25 Irwin suggested that the next great war would sweep the United States into it and by implication into the practice of bombing cities. A layman who rivaled professional airmen in predictive capacities, he saw entire populations pitted against each other, their bombers launching gas attacks rendering a great capital city “in one night... changed from a metropolis to a necropolis.” In a passage borne out by the firestorms of World War II, he imagined how Paris could “suddenly become a superheated furnace ... the population struggling, piling up, shriveling with the heat... the survivors ranging the open fields in the condition of starving animals.” Most telling, he surpassed the professionals by capturing the psychic ease with which men could wage war by air. It “takes advantage of the limits of human imagination. If you bayonet a child, you see the spurt of blood, the
