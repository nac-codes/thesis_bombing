In the end, another consideration also held back the diplomats: if an end to air war meant only a return to slaughter in the trenches, the alternative was hardly attractive. A Harvard professor made this case for gas weapons in no uncertain terms: “however vast the destruction, however ‘inhuman’ the methods used, however appalling the sacrifice of life,” the resolution of conflict by “some quick and overpowering blow” seemed “preferable to its alternative,—a long war ... of mud, vermin, disease and nameless agony,—a war of starvation, exhaustion, lying, brutalization, and madness.” The bomber thus retained its appeal; its restriction made sense only as part of acomprehensive disarmament.

Occasionally someone went further. Will Irwin, in his popular book “The Next War”: An Appeal to Common Sense (1921), hinted at what the United States was capable of by stressing the American role in plans for bombing Germany in 1919 and in development of new and deadly forms of gas, about which Irwin shared the “near hysteria” of the decade.25 Irwin suggested that the next great war would sweep the United States into it and by
