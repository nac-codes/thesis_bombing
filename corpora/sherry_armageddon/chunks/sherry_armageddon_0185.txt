Quantitative restrictions on the size of air forces, qualitative ones on the most threatening kinds of aircraft, proscriptive ones against various kinds of bombing, plus visionary schemes to create an international air force—all taxed the patience and ingenuity of diplomats. The bomber, one nation’s means of defense, was a
