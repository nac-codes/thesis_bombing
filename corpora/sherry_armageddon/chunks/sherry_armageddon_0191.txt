power, and wasteful as a way of guarding against an enemy threat from across the seas. The airplane could do the job cheaply, if freed from the clutches of the army and navy and organized into a separate service. The efficiency of air power was the idée fixe of all his writing, scarcely refined through fifteen years of polemics, supported by crude comparisons of the destructive power of battleships and bombers and buttressed by claims that an entire air force could be operated for the cost of “one or two battleships a year.”22  These claims were central to the appeal of air power at the time of the Washington conference. Indeed, Senator William Borah, the man most responsible for goading the Harding administra- tion into calling the diplomats together, seized on such claims to make the case for naval disarmament. Mitchell's sensational bombing trials against naval targets—carried out in 1921 after months of controversy, given enormous press attention, and followed up by mock raids on east coast cities by Mitchell’s planes—strengthened the claims of the air power enthusiasts. When the ex-German battleship Ostfriesland slid into the Atlantic twenty-one minutes after Mitchell's bombers struck, the bomber seemed to many the best hope for peace and disarmament. In the extravagant predictions of the time, the burden of costly navies would soon be lightened. A Washington headline proclaiming “Airplane [the] Only Hope to Reduce Naval Armaments” captured a popular line of argument.22 When the Washington conference assembled soon after (with Mitchell himself in the American delegation), controversy over Mitchell’s experiment continued to reverberate, and renewed bombing trials would keep it up for years to follow. Hardly enough to make statesmen scrap their navies, the bomber’s merits did help make possible limitations on naval arms: tonnage limits for capital ships in the famous ratio of 5: 5: 3:1.75:1.75 for Britain, the United States, Japan, Italy, and France, respectivel
