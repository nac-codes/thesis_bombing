merits did help make possible limitations on naval arms: tonnage limits for capital ships in the famous ratio of 5: 5: 3:1.75:1.75 for Britain, the United States, Japan, Italy, and France, respectively.  More important for the story of air power, the controversy over the relative merits of the battleship and the bomber meant that in their first sustained look at military aviation, Americans saw it as a way to uphold New Era virtues of economy, efficiency, and technological innovation. The argument for air power appealed to widespread sentiment for the reduction of federal expenditures in the wake of the orgy of wartime spending. It also responded to postwar disillusionment with involvement in European wars by portraying a self-reliant America that would defend its shores without venturing abroad.  Above all, arguments for air power fed on a widespread image of naval armaments as the foremost expression of modern militarism.” After a long naval arms race, one widely seen as a major cause of World War I and renewed after the war’s end, battleships served as the primary symbol of the burden and danger of militarism. The power of the naval lobby—dozens of senior admirals and naval bureaucrats linked with friendly congressmen and powerful industrialists—suggested that vested interests lay behind the pressure to build bigger fleets. Of course there was also an aviation industry, peopled by its share of scoundrels and fast-buck artists and dogged in the 1920s by its wartime reputation for delivering dangerous goods behind schedule for outlandish prices. But in a market saturated with surplus warplanes, the industry was in shambles for much of the 1920s, hardly a match in the public mind for the naval lobby. In addition, because airmen often crossed swords with industrialists or died because of industrial misdeeds, the prophets of air power often appeared as opponents rather than as agents of greedy capitalists; in the years after Mitchell’s court-martial, his more hysteric
