r died because of industrial misdeeds, the prophets of air power often appeared as opponents rather than as agents of greedy capitalists; in the years after Mitchell’s court-martial, his more hysterical defenders viewed him as the victim of nothing less than a vast “Air Trust” conspiracy. In sum, the call for constructing an air force seemed to come from a handful of low-level offi- cers fighting to protect a better idea from corrupt interests.  The fighting within the military services sharpened the image of airmen as challengers of militarism and waste. Their principal opposition often came from the navy, in part because the demands of airmen for a separate department of aviation or a unified department of defense would have undercut the navy’s control over its own air arm, a prospect even naval fliers did not relish. More than that, neither the range of existing airplanes nor the postwar disillusionment with fighting in Europe encouraged the air power enthusiasts to justify the bomber as a replacement for ground armies in waging war overseas, although they offered this justification out of the public eye.*! The best case for an independent air force was to present it as a necessary, economical alternative to the fleet in defense of American coastlines.  A few heretics aside, the admirals played into the hands of the army aviators. Relegating aviation to an auxiliary role in their service, they boasted of the battleship’s invulnerability to air attack —Josephus Daniels, the navy’s civilian secretary, was ready to stand bareheaded on the deck of any battleship Mitchell dared to attack, certain that Mitchell would be “blown to atoms long before he gets close enough to drop salt upon the tail of the navy.”22 The navy resisted Mitchell’s demands for a public test of bombers against warships, then manipulated (as did Mitchell) the ground rules for the 1921 tests to its advantage, and finally (it was alleged) harassed and spied on critics of accepted naval wisdom.
