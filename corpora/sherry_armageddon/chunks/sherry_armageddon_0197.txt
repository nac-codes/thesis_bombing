osephus Daniels, the navy’s civilian secretary, was ready to stand bareheaded on the deck of any battleship Mitchell dared to attack, certain that Mitchell would be “blown to atoms long before he gets close enough to drop salt upon the tail of the navy.”32 The navy resisted Mitchell’s demands for a public test of bombers against warships, then manipulated (as did Mitchell) the ground rules for the 1921 tests to its advantage, and finally (it was alleged) harassed and spied on critics of accepted naval wisdom. Weak attempts to explain away Mitchell’s success in the tests compounded the flaws in the navy’s handling of the defiant aviators.  On technical and tactical matters, the navy’s arguments were not without merit—aircraft faced enormous difficulty in locating ships at sea; naval construction was not a static science. But often the admirals appeared moved by selfish interests and blind faith in naval tradition. The army’s response to Mitchell suggested the same pattern to some critics. Exiling him to San Antonio in 1925 and convicting him on court-martial charges later that year, the army seemed in league with the White House—Calvin Coolidge himself preferred the court-martial charges—in resisting new ideas.  In truth, the stridency rather than the substance of Mitchell’s campaign accounted for much of the wrath of the brass. He did after all accuse them of “incompetency, criminal negligence, and almost treasonable administration.”33 Equally persistent but more patient airmen in both services survived, albeit with difficulties, and they sometimes resented Mitchell’s self-appointed role as hero and martyr. No less important than Mitchell in the development of air power, they have faded from history because Mitchell so supremely drew all the lightning down on himself. By personalizing the issue of air power, his court-martial, along with the turmoil and intrigue which accompanied it, decisively shaped America’s image of the new weapon.  Mitchell and his supporters,
