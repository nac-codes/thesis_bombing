Pershing’s charge, of being infected by the “Bolshevik bug.”35  Marvelous public relations, Mitchell’s war with the armed services paid few immediate political dividends. “Changes in military systems come about only through the pressure of public opinion or disaster in war,” Mitchell believed. But appealing for air power as a money-saving measure became tricky when the opponent was Coolidge, that formidable penny pincher to whom adding another department to the government was heedless extravagance. By squeezing military budgets (“Who’s gonna fight us?” he asked) Coolidge also sharpened the resistance of army leaders to air power claims.3¢ By goading the navy to develop its own aviation, Mitchell also made the embarrassed admirals over into more formidable opponents. Moreover, his vision of a fortress America had political appeal but little strategic immediacy, inasmuch as no enemy was at hand to cross the oceans and land on American shores, and it kept him from forging the natural alliance with naval fliers, who saw aviation as a way to extend the nation’s offensive capacity for protecting global interests.

It gained him headlines but little support among those powerful enough to aid his cause. The attention of press and public opinion was usually fleeting and superficial, directed at the spectacle of sinking battleships and squabbling bureaucr
