until “paralyzed by the power of public opinion.” The very setting of Mitchell's court-martial in a dingy building reeking of “government squalor” suggested his martyrdom by a tawdry and faceless bureaucracy, a replay of old progressive battles pitting the people against the special interests.24  Mitchell and the aviators seemed like courageous warriors for truth and progress. Newspapers noted his “devil-may-care recklessness” and his “romantic sort of personage.” “We may wait,” the Cleveland Press gushed, “a hundred years for another such display of courage.” To his legal counsel, Congressman Frank Reid, Mitchell was “a 1925 John Brown,” who, though “crucified,” will find that “his ideas will go marching on.” Mitchell’s detractors sometimes advanced the image of Mitchell as a rebel, only giving it a malevolent twist by accusing him of employing the “revolutionary methods of the communists” or, in John J.
