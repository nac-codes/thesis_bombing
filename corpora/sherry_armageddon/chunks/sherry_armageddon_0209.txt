g in the air is not a sport. It is scientific murder.”*! Still, unlike the ground soldier, the individual flier stood out in postwar recollections of combat. Lengthy narratives of derring-do focused on what the pilots did to one another, not on their contribution to the carnage on the ground, while most other war literature treated aviation as the peripheral weapon it was; there was no All Quiet on the Western Front for war in the air. On screen, Hell’s Angels (1930) “managed a mild anti-war spirit while extolling flight.” When Hollywood recreated air war in Wings (1927), audiences apparently loved its sentimental plot of an aviator who, his best friend lost behind German lines, flies to rescue him, only to die in his comrade’s arms. Similar themes were evident in Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. ’s, depiction of the American ace Frank Luke: “Like some old-time frontiersman, he wanted every notch on his gun authenticated.” In the 1930s, an American poet could still celebrate the chivalry in the skies of the “Knights of the world’s last knighthood” and invoke mythical Greek warriors to describe airmen. Heroes of the air seemed lifted out of war altogether, serving as much-wanted reminders of the individual’s continued significance in the machine age. Simultaneously, they appeared as throwbacks to an age of more gallant warfare, their courage magnified by the frailty of their machines and the odds against their survival. Given these images, it was easy to ignore the potential of airpower for “scientific murder.”42  Evoking similar images, heroes of peacetime flying received more attention than combat aviators in the 1920s.
