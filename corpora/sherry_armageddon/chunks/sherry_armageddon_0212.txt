- cized battles helped to establish.  THE CULTURAL CONTEXT OF PROPHECY  Bureaucratic battles over military aviation were insufficient in themselves to make the airplane a benign instrument. Complementary images flowing from other currents in the political culture added resonance to the images arising from Mitchell's struggles and also shifted attention further away from the airplane as an instrument of modern warfare.  One source was the continued evocation of combat pilots as knights of the air, the last warriors endowed with individuality in a war of anonymous millions. Holding bittersweet recollections of their experiences, some pilots themselves were reluctant to court heroic status. When Eddie Rickenbacker, the most famous American ace, rushed to print with Fighting the Flying Circus (1919), he also reminded Americans that “fighting in the air is not a sport. It is scientific murder.”*" Still, unlike the ground soldier, the individual flier stood out in postwar recollections of combat. Lengthy narratives of derring-do focused on what the pilots did to one another, not on their contribution to the carnage on the ground, while most other war literature treated aviation as the peripheral weapon it was; there was no All Quiet on the Western Front for war in the air. On screen, Hell’s Angels (1930) “managed a mild anti-war spirit while extolling flight.” When Hollywood recreated air war in Wings (1927), audiences apparently loved its sentimental plot of an aviator who, his best friend lost behind German lines, flies to rescue him, only to die in his comrade’s arms. Similar themes were evident in Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.’s, depiction of the American ace Frank Luke: “Like some old-time frontiersman, he wanted every notch on his gun authenticated.” In the 1930s, an American poet could still celebrate the chivalry in the skies of the “Knights of the world’s last knighthood” and invoke mythical Greek warriors to describe airmen. Heroes of the air seemed lifted out of war
