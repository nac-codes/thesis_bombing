It fastened again the frayed bonds between France and the United States in a way that diplomats had failed to do. “Has any such Ambassador ever been known!” the American ambassador to France exclaimed of Lindbergh, who was hailed as “the glad reuniter of long-riven parts” back in the United States. Through Lindbergh, wartime allies celebrated commonality in the easiest of circumstances, without worry about the differences that divided them.

Similar themes were evident in Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. ’s, depictio
