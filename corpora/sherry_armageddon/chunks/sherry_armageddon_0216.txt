to bring the Lone Eagle home; the army commissioned him a colonel; generals from the Great War toasted his bravery. Surrounding Lindbergh with the trappings of military heroism did not represent a conscious embrace of military virtues and certainly not a recognition of the military potential of aviation. Rather, in the wake of the enormous sacrifices of World War I, only war itself provided a point of reference sufficient for measuring Lindbergh’s achievement.  At the same time, Lindbergh's flight also appeared to confirm the wisdom of sacrifice in the recent war. It fastened again the frayed bonds between France and the United States in a way that diplomats had failed to do. “Has any such Ambassador ever been known!” the American ambassador to France exclaimed of Lindbergh, who was hailed as “the glad reuniter of long-riven parts” back in the United States. Through Lindbergh, wartime allies celebrated commonality in the easiest of circumstances, without worry about the differences that divided them.
