New Republic gathered together conflicting images when it protested the decision to bring Lindbergh home “on a gray battleship with a collection of people all of the same stripe, in a kind of ship that has as much relation to the life of a sea as a Ford factory has! We might as well have put him in a pneumatic tube and shot him across the Atlantic.” Again, as in the bomber-battleship controversy, the suggestion was that flight represented escape from the dehumanization of the machine, a notion echoed by a prominent English politician hailing Lindbergh’s achievement as “a triumph of man over machinery.” At the same time, Americans could admire the industrial discipline and cooperation that lay behind Lindbergh’s deed because the final triumph was clearly an individual act. Lindbergh’s “role was finally a double one,” John William Ward has concluded, serving both to celebrate “the complex institutions which made modern society possible” and to reaffirm an America that was a place of “escape from institutions, from the forms of society, and from limitations put upon the free individual.” As with most potent cultural images, Lindbergh’s flight derived its power in the American imagination from its capacity to hold divergent ideals in suspension.44  His flight crystalized an image that countless other aviators helped to sustain. The press gave tireless attention to their perils and achievements. “You got an airplane, some financial backing, and a press agent, and made the first non-stop flight from one place to another place (there were still plenty of places that nobody had ever flown between),” Frederick Lewis Allen wrote while the hoopla was still fresh.45 Records were made not only to be broken, but to be redefined in a myriad of ways—after a man had made a record, a woman could match it or someone else could fly in the opposite direction or soar over an uncharted and presumably perilous route. America’s military aviators figured prominently in the race to set new re
