They contributed to a sense of individual daring, of the machine’s frailty, and of man’s resourcefulness that made aviation a benign attraction, a fusion of frontier spirit and machine-age discipline. Few wanted to hear Lindbergh say that his famous flight involved slight risk.  Achievements like Lindbergh’s were greeted as signposts on the road to an imminent aerial millennium. Sketched out before the war, the virtues of flight were now elaborated in a frenzy of celebration. “Aviation enthusiasts tended to view flight as a ‘holy cause,” and with religious fervor they outlined its potential to democratize, uplift, and pacify the nations that touched it.
