ingenuity with the benefits of the more impersonal age of the machine.4%  Cultural commentators like Chase and the historian Charles Beard anxiously tried to balance the virtues and dangers of the machine. As they did, they noted the threat of technological war, but they also compartmentalized it, viewing it as an abscess to be cauterized from machine culture. When looking at the possibilities for air war, they raised a specter only to exorcise it.  This approach was evident in a volume that Beard edited. Beard urged readers of Whither Mankind (1928) to “face the assertion that wars among the various nations of machine civilization may destroy the whole order.” Yet, arguing that “the whole mechanical outfit of a capitalistic country can be reproduced in about ten years,” he doubted that any war could be so devastating “that human vitality and science could not restore economic prosperity and even improve upon the previous order. ... We may admit the reality of the perils ahead without adopting the counsel of despair.” Admission, not exploration, was as far as Beard could go. When he closed the volume, a passing warning about “the devastations of war” was overshadowed by the uplifting assertion that “the spirit of intelligent control ... has a fighting chance to prevail.”42  One source of Beard’s optimism can be found in the essay “War and Peace” by Emil Ludwig, a prolific German-born writer. Science made war more horrible, he acknowledged, but it also destroyed its utility, as was evident from the problems visited upon the victors of World War I. Science “has transcended all boundaries and has intertwined the widely differentiated raw materials and industrial domains,” so that no nation could hope to monopolize materials or markets by military conquest. The impersonality of scientific war also made “the idea of heroic death .. . a lie and every exhortation to win martial laurels a crime.” Through history, war had been only the product of “the minds of a few” who ma
