a horror that would be its own deterrent or upon a more buoyant faith that science would simply make war impractical and unattractive.  Lindbergh asserted that his flight signified how aviation would “bring our peoples nearer together in understanding and in friendship than they have ever been.” (Only late in life did he come to regard even civilian aviation as dangerous, an agent of cultural destruction rather than connectedness.) As Mitchell claimed, to oppose the progress of aviation would be to oppose civilization itself, inasmuch as “transportation is the essence of civilization.” W. Jefferson Davis, a much-published expert on aeronautical law and advisor to the government, found aviation a means for realizing “President Wilson’s dream of a League of Nations”: traditional barriers among peoples became “invisible from the skies, and the big booming air liners go shuttling over them, weaving a pattern of new understanding, banishing insularity and prejudice, building up economic interdependence—surest safeguard against war—and fusing old antipathies in the unfailing solving of daily business intercourse.” What political institutions could achieve only painfully in the way of broadened consciousness and international harmony, commerce and science would realize effortlessly. Entranced by such prospects, men were prone to look away from the dangers of aerial technology, in much the same way that people did in the 1960s when space flight was portrayed as an agent of planetary and ecological awareness.52  A tendency to divorce civil and military aviation strengthened optimism in the 1920s and 1930s. To be sure, army aviators skillfully exploited the connection between the two in arguing that they could perform a host of useful peacetime duties, such as aerial mapping, fire fighting, mail-flying, and route development. Henry Ford recognized that “once we know enough about commercial aeronautics, it will not be difficult to turn out military airplanes as needed and to
