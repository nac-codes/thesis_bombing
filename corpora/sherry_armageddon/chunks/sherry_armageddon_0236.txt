re fighting, mail-flying, and route development. Henry Ford recognized that “once we know enough about commercial aeronautics, it will not be difficult to turn out military airplanes as needed and to find the proper pilots for them.” The convertibility of commercial aircraft to military duties was a recognized obstacle to disarmament, especially when governments promoted military aviation “under the guise of commerce.”=3 Yet recognition of a practical connection faded when people attempted to take a longer view of progress, for they assumed that civilian and military aviation were independent elements instead of common constituents of the machine culture. The patterns of aeronautical progress usually observed confirmed that comforting distinction. It was a cliché of the period that aviation had really gotten started, in World War I, as the handmaiden of war but afterward began realizing its peacetime potential. With each passing year, as commercial airlines flourished, aviation seemed less and less a military activity. Progress and peril, science and destruction, peace and war increas- ingly appeared separable.  For a moment, Stuart Chase seemed to confront the danger of air war unblinkingly. In a chilling look at “The Two-Hour War,” which appeared in the New Republic and in his own Men and Machines in 1929, Chase distilled the decade's scare literature and its conflicting impulses about the machine and the airplane. He asked his reader to imagine that in Europe “a thousand men climb into the cockpits of a thousand aircraft” and after a few hours’ flight drop their bombs  per schedule—and so, to all intents and purposes, the civilization founded by William the Conqueror, which gave Bacon, Newton and Watt to the world, comes, in something like half an hour, to a close. Finished and done. London, Liverpool, Manchester, Lancashire, Bristol, Birmingham, Leeds—each has had its appointed place on the code of instructions, and each now duly makes its exit from the list of
