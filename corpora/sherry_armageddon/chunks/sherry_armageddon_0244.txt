proved un- able to sink it, and finally left it to the Coast Guard to finish off. Such a miserable performance badly embarrassed the Air Corps in its attempt to supplant the navy as the first line of coast defense.  The stormiest incident involving aviation in the early thirties, the air mail fiasco of 1934, also left the impression that military aviation, at least in American hands, was a frail instrument of war. The episode began when President Franklin Roosevelt canceled contracts issued to private business to carry the mail and ordered the Army Air Corps to do the job. Benjamin Foulois, the Chief of the Air Corps, was all too eager to prove that his organization could do so. As the New York Times commented, “The proponents of a separate Air Force for defense purposes see for the first time an opportunity to obtain their objective.” But Foulois overplayed his hand. Equipped with obsolete planes and hampered by the inadequate facilities funded by a parsimonious Congress, the aviators found their worst enemy in some unusually severe winter weather. Disaster and embarrassment resulted, as planes crashed, pilots died, and congressmen and journalists mourned the poor boys  Page 45 of 368 1%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  The Decline of Danger  During the 1930s, the attractions of air power that prevailed during happier days persisted, though in somewhat altered forms. Despite increasing world tensions and spreading use of the bomber in several conflicts, expectation that the United States might go to war, particularly that it would do so with the bomber as its foremost weapon, diminished for a time. The airmen’s new doctrine of precision bombing, public debate about air power theories, and American responses to the bomber’s use abroad all made danger appear remote. In turn, remoteness allowed technology and planning to proceed with important questions left unanswered, or even unasked.  PUBLIC IMAGE AND PROFESSIONAL DOCTRINE  As aviation
