ong range of twenty-four hundred miles*—made accurate penetration deep into enemy territory seem possible. But airmen began formulating precision bombing doctrine before 1935, when the first B-17 flew. More demonstrably than usual, this technology was the offspring, not the parent, of doctrine.  Since doctrine preceded capability, it derived as much from strategic ideas, bureaucratic interests, and national politics as from technology. Douhet, Liddell Hart, Mitchell, and others had prepared the way by their talk of vital centers and the Achilles’ heel of the modern nation, implying an enemy’s vulnerability to attack on selected targets. Yet their language was more metaphorical  Page 47 of 368 1%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON 1L Wadd SilaLpelieU DY PLULESSIUI1aL LLUSLLALIULIS.

So had most other army officers, but airmen were different because of the mystique of aviation and the pack mentality induced by their training and their battles with superiors. Infantry or artillery officers also worried about dead-end careers, but at least their branches of service were not suspect in the eyes of the high command. For airmen alone, personal ambition meshed precisely with professional progress.  Walter Millis once assessed the priorities of Air Corps officers between the wars as follows: “Independent power and authority came first; to attain the goal it was next necessary to develop a ‘doctrine’ which would make it militarily valid; finally, with the doctrine established, it was necessary to invent a weapon which would justify the strategy.” Such criticism has been commonplace, and as Millis acknowledged, hardly leveled only at air officers. Nor was it entirely fair, inasmuch as relationships among status, doctrine, and technology were more complex than Millis allowed. If airmen had
