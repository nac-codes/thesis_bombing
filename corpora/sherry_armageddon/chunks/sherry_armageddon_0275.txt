What self-interest and strategy made compelling, the nation’s mood made politic. America’s response to the bloodletting and disillusionment of World War I ruled out dispatch of another great army to fight abroad. In the 1920s it had been neither prudent nor especially compelling for airmen to offer their bombers as a substitute for the expeditionary armies of the past. In the 1930s, as crises abroad imperiled American interests, airmen guardedly advanced the case for a bomber force that could strike across the seas. Air power appealed as well to a deeper strain of antistatism and antimilitarism in American culture because its reliance on a small, technically sophisticated elite apparently avoided the burdens of conscription, taxation, and death. It was the perfect weapon for a nation that wanted the fruits of centralized state power without challenge to traditions of decentralized authority and individual autonomy. It had particular appeal in the Far East, where the gulf between American ambitions and American power was especially great. It would be a kind of “barely visible hand” of national power, providing influence in world affairs while preserving traditions of limited federal authority associated with the nation’s long era of “free security.”2 Airmen never formulated this appeal in such explicit or sweeping terms, of course. But it had informed Mitchell’s arguments for air power, and the young officers at the tactical school quite explicitly recognized the nation’s large stake in world power as well as the widespread popular hostility toward using another mass expeditionary army to effect that power.  Finally, the airmen faced the continuing need to justify the bomber as not only a practical but a humane instrument of war. Memories of World War I made many Americans demand nothing less of mil
