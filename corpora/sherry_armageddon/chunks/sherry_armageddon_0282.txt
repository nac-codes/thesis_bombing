ut the key components of the modern state and how to attack them, air planners were exasperatingly vague about how defeat would follow upon their destruction. At times, following a more traditional definition of strategy, they suggested that destruction would lead to victory by undermining the war-making capacity of an enemy; deprived of the sinews of war or the means to transport them, its military forces would gradually become unable to fight on. But that line of argument presumed that the enemy’s forces were the objective and promised no quick victory. More often airmen talked of destroying the “enemy’s will to resist . .. centered in the mass of the people.”!2 Defining the objective in that way did not mandate direct attacks on a civilian population, inasmuch as its will might be shattered when the population witnessed the paralysis of its economy or military forces. Neither did it exclude such attacks, a matter on which there was con- siderable hedging.  The planners’ vacillation about whether the final objective would be the morale of the population or its war-making capacity was a critical weakness in their doctrine. A 1926 text asserted that “complete destruction of vital parts of the enemy’s sources of supply” would lead “eventually . . . to the collapse of the whole system.”!3 In the masterful evasion of Muir Fairchild, an important tactical school instructor who wrote in the wake of Poland’s defeat in 1939:  Page 52 of 368 12%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON machine that we know as New York could not function...
