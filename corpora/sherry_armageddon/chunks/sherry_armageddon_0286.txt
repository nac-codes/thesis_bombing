things that can go wrong in war, would disrupt navigational precision. Only a slight disruption in the air would translate into gross inaccuracies on the ground, especially inasmuch as Air Corps calculations on bombing accuracy already rested on shaky probability theory. And if planes nonetheless found and bombed targets accurately, their destruction still might not achieve the expected effect if the targets chosen were in fact not critical to the functioning of the enemy state, or if they had been dispersed by an enemy in anticipation of attack, or if they possessed unused capacity (slack, it was later called) so that only a surviving remnant met critical needs. By the same token, a damaged target might be repaired quickly, or some alternative to the critical bottleneck might be jerryrigged—an alternative rail line expanded, a vital material imported, a new industrial process substituted. The Air Corps recognized that target selection involved an extraordinary economic sophistication that it lacked. The resourcefulness of combatants in World War I—albeit under conditions that seemed leisurely to visionaries of air war—might have argued for more caution on this matter. And these uncertainties, the stuff of countless later critiques of air power theory, paled before the one most obvious to Wells but least appreciated by airmen in the 1930s: if every other assumption proved valid—attack proceeded, disruption spread, paralysis set in, defeat was inflicted— it remained unclear how air power could translate defeat into surrender.  Strategic bombing theory was like the complex modern society airmen imagined, so interdependent in its assumptions that the failure of one component would unravel the whole thing. As one critic has neatly put it, the airmen “assumed that virtually every significant aspect of modern society was distinct enough to be identified for destruction, yet interdependent enough to bring about total collapse of a nation once certain links were destroyed.”
