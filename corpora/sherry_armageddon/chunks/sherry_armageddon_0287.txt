every significant aspect of modern society was distinct enough to be identified for destruction, yet interdependent enough to bring about total collapse of a nation once certain links were destroyed.”!* The airmen rarely recognized such flaws in their assumptions. Of course, other military doctrines of the day had their weaknesses as well. More than that, the fliers were not challenged to explore weaknesses in strategic theory. Inasmuch as they usually justified air power to their superiors as a weapon of continental defense, the issue was rarely joined within military circles.

Neither did it exclude such attacks, a matter on which there was con- siderable hedging.  The planners’ vacillation about whether the final objective would be the morale of the population or its war-making capacity was a critical weakness in their doctrine. A 1926 text asserted that “complete destruction of vital parts of the enemy’s sources of supply” would lead “eventually . . . to the collapse of the whole system.”!2 In the masterful evasion of Muir Fairchild, an important tactical school instructor who wrote in the wa
