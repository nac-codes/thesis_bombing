enemy’s sources of supply” would lead “eventually . . . to the collapse of the whole system.”!2 In the masterful evasion of Muir Fairchild, an important tactical school instructor who wrote in the wake of Poland’s defeat in 1939:  The industrial mechanisms which provide the means of war to the armed forces, and those that provide the means of sustaining a normal life to the civil population, are not separate, disconnected entities. They are joined at many vital points. If not electrical power, then the destruction of some other common element, will render them both inoperative at a single blow. The nationwide reaction to the stunning discovery that the sources of the country’s power to resist and sustain itself, are being relentlessly destroyed, can hardly fail to be decisive.14  This was a disturbing mixture of confidence about success and evasion about how to achieve it. Admittedly, Fairchild finally considered the enemy’s will as the ultimate objective, and distinctions between the will and the capacity to wage war can be arbitrary. Yet it made a great difference, in strategy and in the lives of attackers and defenders, which objective was singled out. For Fairchild, ap- parently, one objective was as good as another. As was often the case in strategic thinking, belief in success encouraged imprecision about how to achieve it.  This conceptual problem was equally evident in imagining what would happen once an objective was attacked. Few airmen speculated about when an enemy’s will would collapse or how a discouraged populace would bring a nation to surrender. Perhaps, it was argued, “the citizens of a democracy will demand that their representatives accept peace even with defeat when their will-to- fight has completely changed to fear.”15 Combining the red scare with the air scare, this said nothing about how dictatorships would respond to war’s horrors. In any event, no one worked out the en- suing chain of events in any detail. Even the references to panic in
