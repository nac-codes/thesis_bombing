of air war remained largely unexplored. From one perspective, the new doctrine appeared more refined and humane in its focus on select economic targets rather than on the lives and homes of civilians and their leaders. Yet it did not clearly substitute economy for morale as an objective but rather saw economic targets as a more effective point of attack on the enemy’s nerves. Dislocation of the economy superseded dismemberment of the society but with the same end in view, the destruction of the will to fight.

Few airmen speculated about when an enemy’s will would collapse or how a discouraged populace would bring a nation to surrender. Perhaps, it was argued, “the citizens of a democracy will demand that their representatives accept peace even with defeat when their will-to- fight has completely changed to fear.”15 Combining the red scare with the air scare, this said nothing about how dictatorships would respond to war’s horrors. In any event, no one worked out the en- suing chain of events in any detail. Even the references to panic in World War I that peppered writings in the 1920s largely disappeared.  Indeed, numerous flaws in American air doctrine went largely unexamined. The invincibility of the unescorted bomber formation was an article of faith; Flying Fortress was no idle choice of name for the B-17. In theory, bombing by daylight permitted the necessary precision, while the bomber’s speed, thick skin, bristling armament, and high altitude provided the requisite defense. But unexpectedly strong enemy air defenses, in conjunction with foul weather and human error and all the other things
