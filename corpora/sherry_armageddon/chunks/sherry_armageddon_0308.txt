course of empire will take its way,” he grandly pronounced. He also portrayed Japan as scheming to attack not only American possessions but the United States itself, construct- ing secret “air fortresses” from which huge fleets of aircraft would bomb American cities. The Japanese, he warned in one of the last speeches he wrote, considered the United States “a decadent military power” and believed that “we will be as easy to attack as a large jellyfish.”24  More menacing than ever, Japan also appeared more vulnerable. Submarines could destroy Japan’s commerce, and its cities were attractive targets: “These towns are built largely of wood and paper to resist the devastations of earthquakes and form the greatest aerial targets the world has ever seen... . Incendiary projectiles would burn the cities to the ground in short order. An attack by gas, surging down through the valleys, would completely block them out.” American planes could strike easily through the Aleutians, the Kurile Islands, or Eastern Siberia. “An understanding with Russia that would allow the United States to operate through Siberia and Kamchatka would be decisive against Japan.” For Mitchell, war against the “yellow military peril” seemed easy and inviting. Significantly, the humanitarian defense he usually offered for air power—as a weapon whose frightfulness would require few casualties—had no place in these musings. Destruction would be total, not selective.22  Undoubtedly known to the Air Corps, Mitchell’s ideas were only an object of casual interest for most of the 1930s. Official plans noted the critical role aircraft might play in defense of the Philippines but assigned them no larger mission. In 1935, an important air planner pointed out the deterrent value of such bombers, which might go far “toward squelching any expansion ideas on the part of an Asiatic Power.” More boldly, a student at the tactical school presented Japan as “an ideal objective for air attack,” suggesting that Japanese re
