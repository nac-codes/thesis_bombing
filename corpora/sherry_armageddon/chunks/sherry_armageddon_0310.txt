sideshow in the army, described by one student as “comparatively bar- ren of strategic theory and interest” before 1938.25  Similar casualness and inconsistency prevailed in higher political circles and in the nation at large, which exhibited toward the Far East a “mixture of moral globalism and fear of military involvement” that could be reconciled only by “tortured argument,” as Akira Iriye has written.26 James Farley once recalled that at one of FDR's first cabinet meetings, the new president took note of Japan’s vulnerability to bombing from the Aleutians, but the claim lacks verification. Roosevelt had previously been in touch with Mitchell, but he was a committed navalist, on record as condemning Mitchell’s views and later as declaring chemical warfare “inhuman and contrary to what modern civilization should stand for.” In 1937 and 1938, he had the State Department condemn Japanese bombing of civilians in China as “barbarous” violations of the “elementary principles” of modern morality. Secretary of State Cordell Hull also arranged an informal embargo on the sale of aviation equipment to nations using “airplanes for attack on civilian populations,” with the Senate cooperating in its own “unqualified condemnation of the inhuman bombing of civilian populations.”2?  Consistency rarely bound Roosevelt. In 1934 Hull offered the Japanese ambassador a scarcely veiled threat by pointing out that Britain, another island nation once seemingly secure, could have its capital wiped out by a fleet of two thousand bombing planes and noting how an American airplane had recently flown from the United States to Japan. Such talk was perhaps one reason for another bombing scare in Japan, the second in three years. In general, however, Roosevelt did not give air power much thought before 1938. When he did consider the possibility of war with Japan he turned first to naval power, toying in 1937 and 1938 with vague schemes for an Anglo-American “peaceful blockade” of Japanese comme
