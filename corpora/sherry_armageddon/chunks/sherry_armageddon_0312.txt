ontributing to early notions about bombing Japan, it helped expose important dynamics behind the rise of American air power. Those notions revealed the aggressive fantasies about air power that aviators and other Americans usually held in check, suggesting that the humane rationale imbedded in the doctrine of precision bombing was frail and disposable.
