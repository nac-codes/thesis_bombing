in 1936, a proposed long-range bomber was “distinctly an airplane of aggression” that had “no place in the armament of a nation which has a National Policy of good will and a Military Policy of protection, not aggression.”2° Only after 1938 did a national policy for strategic air power begin to take shape.  PUBLIC DEBATE AND EXPERT REASSURANCE  Beyond official circles, a public debate about air power continued, one characterized by real concern and interest but giving the skeptics a small margin over those who prophesied that air power offered either total victory or supreme danger. As aerial holocaust grew closer, its danger seemed to recede. That at least was the impression conveyed by popular images of American aviation and by informed examinations of air power and the nation’s strategic needs.  The American air force in particular appeared as a weapon of growing but still limited utility after the air mail affair of 1934. With Mitchell's eclipse and then his death in 1936, no well-known exponent of American air power spoke to the nation. Perhaps the most visible authorities were Henry Harley Arnold and Ira Eaker, two Air Corps officers who collaborated on three books in the late thirties and early forties, but these gave only a brief glimpse of the more terrifying possibilities of air power and emphasized the defensive aspect of American air power. Other Air Corps officials maintained a similar emphasis in public. Major General Oscar Westover, the Chief of the Air Corps, alluded to new missions for aircraft like the B-17, emphasizing their capacity to “keep us out of war” and mentioning Japan’s fear of “ruthless bombardment of her tinder-box cities” by Russian bombers based at Vladivostok. In public, few aviators fleshed out these suggestions of offensive and deter- rent functions for air forces.2°  Most Americans continued to hear about the familiar scenario of aerial interception of sea or air armadas. In 1937, for example, the press reported a test ordered b
