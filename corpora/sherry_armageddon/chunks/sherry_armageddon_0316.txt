In 1937, for example, the press reported a test ordered by Roosevelt in which an air squadron located a battleship in fog hundreds of miles off the West Coast—“the greatest happenstance in the world,” Curtis LeMay admitted—and sunk it in a mock attack. Americans saw the familiar battleship—bomber controversy waged anew. A highly publicized flight of B-17s to South America that same year—LeMay was again the navigator—reworked the same theme in a hemispheric context, in line with the expanded concept of defense that the Roosevelt administration was developing. The climax of these headline-grabbing episodes came in a stunt—the Air Corps pulled out all the stops in securing newspaper and live coast-to-coast radio coverage—in which LeMay again led a flight of B-17s, this time in the interception of the Italian liner Rex in the Atlantic. Accompanied by dramatic photographs, a New York Herald Tribune article sounded the familiar defensive theme with the headline, “FLYING FORTS, 630 MILES OUT, SPOT ENEMY TROOP SHIP.” All the hoopla reiterated the potential of aviation as an instrument of defense against invasion and loss of isolation.

Consistency rarely bound Roosevelt. In 1934 Hull offered the Japanese ambassador a scarcely veiled threat by pointing out that Britain, another island nation once seemingly secure, could have its capital wiped out by a fleet of two thousand bombing planes and noting how an American airplane had recently flown from the United
