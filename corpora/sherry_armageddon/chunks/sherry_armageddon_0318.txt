Japanese, mention of bombing them required little consideration of how aerial victory would be accomplished. Hence contemplation remained occasional, almost offhand.  Racism was hardly peculiar to Americans, mirrored as it was among those Japanese caught up in their own visions of racial destiny. It weaved its way through the whole course of Japanese- American relations. But in contributing to early notions about bombing Japan, it helped expose important dynamics behind the rise of American air power. Those notions revealed the aggressive fantasies about air power that aviators and other Americans usually held in check, suggesting that the humane rationale imbedded in the doctrine of precision bombing was frail and disposable. Simi- larly, they showed how the idea of air power was informed by fears and passions reaching far beyond the rational language of strategic calculation which airmen usually employed.  The casualness of American thinking about air war in the Far East was another indication of the state of official regard for strategic air power at mid-decade. The official view of air power was in a curious state of suspension, caught between the abstract or fanciful speculations of the Army Air Corps, the military bureaucracy’s continued distrust of airmen, and the episodic and confused attention of the White House and Congress. In an Air Corps ambitious but fearful of alienating superiors and public opinion, dreams of a great mission seeped through the cracks of more guarded propaganda for the cause. The army general staff, more alert than ever to the tactical role of aviation, bore down on the Air Corps by prohibiting production of the B-17 (beyond thirteen prototypes) and by challenging research and development for more advanced bombers. As one general staff officer put it in 1936, a proposed long-range bomber was “distinctly an airplane of aggression” that had “no place in the armament of a nation which has a National Policy of good will and a Military Po
