ive and deter- rent functions for air forces.3°  Most Americans continued to hear about the familiar scenario of aerial interception of sea or air armadas. In 1937, for example, the press reported a test ordered by Roosevelt in which an air squadron located a battleship in fog hundreds of miles off the West Coast—“the greatest happenstance in the world,” Curtis LeMay admitted—and sunk it in a mock attack. Americans saw the familiar battleship—bomber controversy waged anew. A highly publicized flight of B-17s to South America that same year—LeMay was again the navigator—reworked the same theme in a hemispheric context, in line with the expanded concept of defense that the Roosevelt administration was developing. The climax of these headline-grabbing episodes came in a stunt—the Air Corps pulled out all the stops in securing newspaper and live coast-to-coast radio coverage—in which LeMay again led a flight of B-17s, this time in the interception of the Italian liner Rex in the Atlantic. Accompanied by dramatic photographs, a New York Herald Tribune article sounded the familiar defensive theme with the headline, “FLYING FORTS, 630 MILES OUT, SPOT ENEMY TROOP SHIP.” All the hoopla reiterated the potential of aviation as an instrument of defense against invasion and loss of isolation.31 So too did most of the extensive press coverage given to the B-17 and the experimental models of longer-range bombers in the late thirties. If war came, these aircraft were apparently designed to avoid the destruction of cities and seek out the enemy’s troopships or war-making apparatus with fine-tuned preci- sion, for their pilots were “trained from the beginning and at all times in ‘spot’ bombing instead of ‘area’ bombing” and were able to “drop a bomb into a pickle barrel from 18,000 feet up.”22  Indeed, in the years before Pearl Harbor, a curious inversion of logic in debate about aircraft types moved Americans further away from recognizing the role their new bombers might play.
