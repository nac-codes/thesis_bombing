“Public uncertainty notwithstanding,” he asserted, “the function of a bomber is not primarily the destruction of defenseless women and children. Neither is the bomber essentially an ‘offensive’ weapon.” The long-range bomber, one congressman claimed in 1939, gave America “the ability to strike the enemy over the only two ways in which he can approach the United States, and that is over the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean,” satisfying his wish to “have the fighting occur in somebody else’s parlor rather than in my parlor.” As John Chamberlain, writing in the New Republic, asked in criticizing the administration’s interest in short-range bombers, “Isn’t it at least arguable that our plane factories are being geared to turn out the types of plane needed for another overseas expeditionary force?” Thus a developing offensive capacity to bomb others remained disguised by preoccupation with protecting ourselves and preventing World War I. Big planes would protect American ideals and isolation, while little planes would undermine them.32  At the same time, another belief continued to grow: that air war against cities was likely to prove counterproductive, indeed, that the strategic uses of air power might be less important than the tactical. The arguments along these lines by skeptics of strategic air power, while often sound as analysis of contemporary experience or as pronouncement on the future, also diminished the dan- gers ahead.  The skeptics followed several lines of attack on the doctrine of strategic air war. They often began by attacking the motives of the air prophets, as when the American Mercury charged that “the flyers, seeking larger appropriations, have taken to playing the politician’s game, i.e., conjuring up a terrible bogey, and then representing themselves as the only sorcerers capable of exorcising it.” On the diplomatic level, Commonweal, with Hitler’s threats in mind, saw in the fantasy of aerial holocaust “a new method of saber-rattling” by which “almost
