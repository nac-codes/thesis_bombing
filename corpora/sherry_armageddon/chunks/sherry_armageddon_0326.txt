Accompanied by dramatic photographs, a New York Herald Tribune article sounded the familiar defensive theme with the headline, “FLYING FORTS, 630 MILES OUT, SPOT ENEMY TROOP SHIP.” All the hoopla reiterated the potential of aviation as an instrument of defense against invasion and loss of isolation.2! So too did most of the extensive press coverage given to the B-17 and the experimental models of longer-range bombers in the late thirties. If war came, these aircraft were apparently designed to avoid the destruction of cities and seek out the enemy’s troopships or war-making apparatus with fine-tuned preci- sion, for their pilots were “trained from the beginning and at all times in ‘spot’ bombing instead of ‘area’ bombing” and were able to “drop a bomb into a pickle barrel from 18,000 feet up.”22  Indeed, in the years before Pearl Harbor, a curious inversion of logic in debate about aircraft types moved Americans further away from recognizing the role their new bombers might play. Critics suspicious that Roosevelt was maneuvering the United States into a European war saw danger in the production of short-range tactical aircraft, inasmuch as their only foreseeable use would be to accompany American ground forces in battle against the Axis powers, Better, one writer argued, to construct three or four thousand long-range precision
