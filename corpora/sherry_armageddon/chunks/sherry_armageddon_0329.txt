a traditional definition of war objectives and strategy. The trouble with air power, a naval officer wrote, is that it “can take nothing. It can hold nothing. It cannot stand its ground and fight.” A more sophisticated analysis of modern combat in Fortune dismissed prophecies like Douhet's as “pure romance,” suggesting that no changes in technology had been decisive enough to overshadow traditional forms of warfare. A prominent army general reminded his audience “that every war must be won—finally—by sending men into enemy territory—and holding it.” Mocking the prophets, he concluded: “After Samson smote the Philistines ‘hip and thigh’ and slew a thousand men with the jawbone of an ass, we may guess that some dreamers of that time would have equipped their military forces with asses’ jawbones, exclusively. That would have been a grave mistake then, and it would be now.” Similar sentiments lay at the heart of the 1934 report by a prestigious committee chaired by former Secretary of War Newton Baker, and they ran through a wide range of popular writing. Even after Poland’s fall, Harper’s ran an article entitled “Bombing Cities Won't Win the War” that maintained that “no war will be won by attacking civil populations in cities. No war will be won by the airplane alone. For it can’t be and it won't be. War is won by infantry and money to.buy wheat.” According to Commonweal, it was “axiomatic that our cities are not destined for destruction from the air during the next emergency.” Antiaircraft defense “has gone a long way since H. G. Wells wrote ‘The War in the Air,” too far for generals to waste planes in attacks on cities.36  The heart of the skeptics’ argument was their belief that because air war against cities was impractical and counterproductive, it simply would not occur. Reassurance, that is, rested on the assumption that generals and politicians would rationally calculate the futility of bombing cities. The “fabric” of civilization is not going to be disrupted
