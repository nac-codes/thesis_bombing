isrupted by such bombing, one skeptic announced: “The reader can be sure that similar calculations have been made by the staffs of all nations whom air warfare on a large scale might possibly concern, and that the ultimate futility of a policy of air terrorism has been perceived.” An additional restraint would come from popular pressures to avoid air attack on enemy cities lest it trigger reprisals, civilians being likely to engage in “lynching any of their own airmen they can lay hands on” if they attempted such an attack.37  Repeatedly the skeptics ignored the contention of air prophets that the objective of armed force in war had changed: “no army would waste its very limited resources on the civil population. The objective of an army is the subjugation of the enemy army.” Some also denied the impact of technology on the moral standards of war’s conduct. “Wholesale destruction of the civil population has been a matter of humanity or inhumanity, civilization or barbarism, rather than of weapons.” The same writer even denied the impact of technology on tactics: “Cavalry will still be needed and used,” wars will be won “by a man with a knife in his hand.”38  The skeptics’ argument, then, fell short in several ways. By exaggerating the utility of knives and horses, some risked sounding like military Luddites. By asserting that aviation would find its most valuable role in supporting traditional forms of force, others suggested its use in situations requiring great precision, even while they had denied aviation’s technological capacity against strategic targets. Most of all, by defining the objective of war as the defeat of the enemy’s forces and the seizure of territory and by assuming that nations would rationally pursue that objective, they overlooked the appeal and utility of supposedly irrational uses of military force.  Writing for an American audience, Winston Churchill unwittingly demonstrated this last flaw in the skeptical argument. Churchill contended that
