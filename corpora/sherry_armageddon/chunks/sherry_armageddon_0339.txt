w much Churchill ever believed them may be arguable, for it was Churchill who five years earlier had described London as “the greatest target in the world, a kind of tremendous, fat, valuable cow tied up to attract the beast of prey.” Perhaps his knowledge of radar later changed his mind on London’s vulnerability.  In any event, Churchill did give a hint as to how the bombing of cities might yet occur. Terror bombing of urban areas might be useless, but if the RAF disrupted daylight attacks aimed at precise targets, an enemy could “only drop bombs indiscriminately upon built-up areas, protesting, of course, that there are military objectives somewhere thereabouts.” Churchill had led his readers right back to the scenario he had rejected. He acknowledged that city-bombing would take place, albeit only as a reluctant or desperate attempt to use bombers of doubtful utility for other purposes or to abide by demands for vengeance or quick action. Here again was the less satisfying prospect that neither skeptics nor enthusiasts explored, bent as they were on defending or refuting bombing as a de- cisive weapon of rational policymakers.32  The assumption that war would follow a rational course might have diminished the skeptics’ persuasiveness had it not been often shared by their opponents, the prophets of aerial doomsday, who still portrayed a future war of reassuring terror. A few, to be sure, left little to cling to beyond the speed of holocaust: if war struck the world’s capitals and “took the lives of all their inhabitants,” it would be over in a few hours. More typical was a Readers Digest prediction that the prospect of incendiary bombing would make it “less urgent for nations to settle their difficulties by the insanity of armed conflict.”4°  With Mitchell’s voice silenced, the most lurid predictions came from England, where the fear of air war on cities remained greatest.
