in the end disastrous defensive attitude.” Unlike many writers, he acknowledged the possibility that the resulting air war might become deadlocked, though he thought this unlikely because two combatants rarely would be evenly matched. Avoiding the blanket generalizations of many other writers, Eliot was also careful to point out that geographical conditions greatly affected the vulnerability of nations to air attack or their capacity to employ it. In the end, he remained guardedly optimistic. Regarding the knockout aerial blow, “the weight of considered military opinion is against this possibility.” Air power was more likely to realize its potential in spearheading ground and naval forces, in attacking well-defined military and economic objectives, and (he emphasized after Munich) in serving as a weapon of intimidation in diplomatic crises.*¢  Page 62 of 368 15%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  back to the scenario he had rejected. He acknowledged that city-bombing would take place, albeit only as a reluctant or desperate attempt to use bombers of doubtful utility for other purposes or to abide by demands for vengeance or quick action. Here again was the less satisfying prospect that neither skeptics nor enthusiasts explored, bent as they were on defending or refuting bombing as a de- cisive weapon of rational policymakers.22  The assumption that war would follow a rational course might have diminished the skeptics’ persuasiveness had it not been often shared by their opponents, the prophets of aerial doomsday, who still portrayed a future war of reassuring terror. A few, to be sure, left little to cling to beyond the speed of holocaust: if war struck the world’s capitals and “took the lives of all their inhabitants,” it would be over in a few hours. More typical was a Readers Digest prediction that the prospect of incendiary bombing would make it “less urgent for nations to settle their difficulties by the insanity of armed conflict.”4¢
