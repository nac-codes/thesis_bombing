d then they become more useful to the enemy alive than dead.” Langdon-Davies offered prophetic insight into the psychological consequences of air raids on cities. “It is not merely that the individual feels helpless to save himself,” he wrote, “it is much more a realization that the ability to take part in the communal life has vanished.” Extrapolating wildly from a few firsthand experiences in Spain, he also prom- ised that air war could so quickly force a rational decision to surrender that destruction and carnage need not worry his readers.42  Sometimes ideological passions twisted the prophets’ view of the future. J. F. C. Fuller, the influential English military critic and historian, became hysterical about the danger of mass panic and cowardice in the face of aerial attack. Sympathetic to the English fascists, he distrusted the loyalty and steadfastness of Jewish and working-class Englishmen should war come, certain that the “terrifying moral effect of bombing” would lead to “complete industrial paralyzation,” a “surrender to mob violence,” or “a civil war in the middle of a foreign one!” His only solution was to discipline the population, and his prescriptions dripped contempt for the masses and for democratic government.43  Writing after the start of the European war, the American aviator Al Williams also emphasized the political and psychological effects of air attacks on cities.

His assessment of American needs in the air became sidetracked by an outpouring of venom against England, Roosevelt, and the forces of internationalism that were supposedly dragging the United States into war. At the same time, Williams saw himself as a simple airman who hated politics and was comfortable only with his
