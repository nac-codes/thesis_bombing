His was an uncomplicated vision.

Terrorization, he acknowledged, had satisfied a German need for blood and vengeance in World War I, but he emphasized how bombing would be a rational instrument of quick victory.

Civilian populations “can best be immobilized—that is irrationalized—by suspense. There is no need to smash them physically; instead they must be dislocated psychologically, and then they become more useful to the enemy alive than dead.” Langdon-Davies offered propheti
