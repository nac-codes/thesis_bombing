e of reprisal for like enemy conduct.”42 Not only had “reprisal” escalated air war in World War I (as Eliot knew), but Eliot’s faith in the constraints of morality and public opinion overlooked the fickleness of public opinion and conflicted with his attempt to ground American policy in hardheaded calculations of interest.  In addition, Eliot’s commitment to the ideals of isolation and voluntarism undercut his appraisal of possible American strategy in the air. It is true that he belittled the notion “that all we have to do is to insure ourselves against actual invasion.” Such a narrow conception of strategy, he argued, would leave American interests abroad undefended and potential enemies undeterred—only an enemy’s fear of destruction, not simply a fear his offensive might fail, would make him pause. But Eliot, like so many Americans, abhorred the political and economic regimentation they assumed would accompany creation of an expeditionary army sufficient to arouse an enemy’s fear of devastation. At this point, political ideals, not cold calculations of national interest, again guided Eliot’s thinking. “Why should we go to war to defend freedom if we must begin by destroying it with our own hands?” Eliot reconciled the imperatives of national security and political freedom by embracing sea power, which he argued could intercept any invasion and inflict intolerable pain by blockade against an enemy.42  It was a curious choice on Eliot’s part, defended less by strategic reasoning than by the claim that adequate naval power could be mobilized through voluntary methods. Precisely the same argument could have been made for air power, but Eliot did not foresee that the bomber could replace the battleship as the nation’s foremost offensive weapon. Demonstrating the common inversion of thinking on these matters, he warned against the development of short-range aircraft useful only in a land war abroad and argued for long-range bombers capable of assisting the fleet in pat
