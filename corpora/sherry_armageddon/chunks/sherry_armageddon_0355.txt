version of thinking on these matters, he warned against the development of short-range aircraft useful only in a land war abroad and argued for long-range bombers capable of assisting the fleet in patrolling the seas. Only in passing did he note that “if the day ever comes when hostile bombers can cross the ocean directly from foreign bases, one of the most effective insurances we can have against such a thing being attempted will be our ability to execute reprisals in kind.”42  Page 65 of 368 15%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  because two combatants rarely would be evenly matched.
