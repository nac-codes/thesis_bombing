ating the common inversion of thinking on these matters, he warned against the development of short-range aircraft useful only in a land war abroad and argued for long-range bombers capable of assisting the fleet in patrolling the seas. Only in passing did he note that “if the day ever comes when hostile bombers can cross the ocean directly from foreign bases, one of the most effective insurances we can have against such a thing being attempted will be our ability to execute reprisals in kind.”42  Most tellingly, Eliot assumed that realistic calculations of interest would govern the decisions of nations in the maw of war. At times he recognized other possibilities. Amid the excruciating strain produced by an event like the Munich crisis, he noted, people do not calculate coolly but “react like a suddenly loosened spring.” In wartime, ideological and national passions can lead combatants to regard their enemy as “human scum to be wiped from the face of the earth,” leading to a reenactment of “all the merciless ferocities of those Dark Ages which we have so proudly boasted were forever behind us.”*° But he did not examine how air power might be the instrument of such passions. His consistent theme was that “all contemplation of war is based on the weighing of risk against advantage.” As he put it in “The Impossible War With Japan,” “a war which, by reason of its perfectly-known military, geographical, and strategical factors, cannot, demonstrably, turn out to the permanent advantage of either side, a war between nations so situated that neither has anything very serious to fear from the other within its own selected sphere of influence and activity, is a war that is not going to take place. It is an impossible war.” Eliot’s assumption of rational calculations minimized his acknowledgment of the danger of all-out air war. Germany might be tempted to strike at London, but “the masters of modern Germany are not fools.”>1 His reasoning resembled that of other experts who
