ns’ panic about air war confirmed a conclusion already formed from observations in Spain and China: the potency of air war on cities lay more in its threat than in its actual use; its value was more political than military. Employing the bomber for psychological terror and political intimidation appeared to be ushering in a new kind of political—military war of nerves, a kind of war to which “fascist” or “totalitarian” governments were especially inclined and for which they were especially adept. Archibald MacLeish, the American poet and playwright, gave expression to this notion in his radio play, Air Raid, evoking the fascist threat and challenging illusions of invulnerability to which he thought people still clung. An observer of the Spanish civil war regarded the bombing of cities as “the instrument of the dictator, rather than the general. It carries frightfulness to horizons which [the] sternest militarists are becoming afraid to reflect upon.” The very fact that bombing was too inaccurate to serve military purposes made it primarily an instrument of “terrorism”: after all, random and unpredictable bombing enhanced terror.®+  Furthermore, it appeared, dictators had the power and ruthlessness to harness the psychological terror of the bomber to a broader scheme of intimidation and subversion, while holding their own populations in check during an agonizing war of nerves.

Some analysts added a further point: because fascist countries lacked the discipline, patience, or resources to win by a protracted conventional war—an accurate prediction, though in conflict with the image of ironclad control over populations—they would be all the more inclined to grab for a cheap victory by resorting to terror. Opinions differed about whether the resort to ter- ror would work and whether it reflected fascist stupidity or cunning, desper
