and playwright, gave expression to this notion in his radio play, Air Raid, evoking the fascist threat and challenging illusions of invulnerability to which he thought people still clung. An observer of the Spanish civil war regarded the bombing of cities as “the instrument of the dictator, rather than the general. It carries frightfulness to horizons which [the] sternest militarists are becoming afraid to reflect upon.” The very fact that bombing was too inaccurate to serve military purposes made it primarily an instrument of “terrorism”: after all, random and unpredictable bombing enhanced terror.®+  Furthermore, it appeared, dictators had the power and ruthlessness to harness the psychological terror of the bomber to a broader scheme of intimidation and subversion, while holding their own populations in check during an agonizing war of nerves. The fact that the Luftwaffe was the most visibly nazified branch of the German armed forces may have lent credence to this line of reasoning. Some analysts added a further point: because fascist countries lacked the discipline, patience, or resources to win by a protracted conventional war—an accurate prediction, though in conflict with the image of ironclad control over populations—they would be all the more inclined to grab for a cheap victory by resorting to terror.®2 Opinions differed about whether the resort to ter- ror would work and whether it reflected fascist stupidity or cunning, desperation or design. Agreement was widespread, however, that bombing cities had a special place in the hearts of fascists.  Debate on air war had taken on a political complexion that was largely missing in the 1920s, when its eventual employment was regarded as possible by all nations, regardless of their political forms or ideology. In one more way, the danger of air war had become both magnified and circumscribed—magnified in that the Axis powers now loomed as a force lacking scruples in the resort to air war, but circumscribed insofa
