more way, the danger of air war had become both magnified and circumscribed—magnified in that the Axis powers now loomed as a force lacking scruples in the resort to air war, but circumscribed insofar as its use by other nations, its role as a universal weapon of war, had faded from debate. The widespread opinion in the late thirties that the Western democracies lagged far behind Germany and Italy in the development of strategic air power strengthened this perspective. So, too, did the resounding denunciations of bombing in China and Spain made by the press and by the governments of the democracies and the general emphasis on the defensive nature of British and American preparations for air war. Bombing cities was something that only fascist govern- ments, foolishly or not, attempted.  The rise of the fascist powers and their air raids on cities were very convenient for the Western democracies. The opposing images of the two camps that were fashioned almost inverted reality. The Germans never made a concerted effort to wage strategic air war, although occasionally they shifted tactical aircraft to strategic missions when opportunity, miscalculation, or fits of desperation came into play. Later, Hitler yearned for a miracle instrument of strategic air war. But he never gave strategic air power sustained support, and it lacked solid grounding in both the technology and the doctrine of the German air force.  An impression to the contrary outside Germany may be forgiven in light of Hitler’s boasts and the fascist record in Ethiopia and Spain. Exaggerating German intentions and capabilities, British and American officials thought they were following the Nazis’ lead, not pioneering the course toward air war against cities. But it remained the case that, in the 1930s, only England and America seriously developed the concept and instruments of strategic air war. Of course, in both countries that development was shrouded in a fog of bureaucratic battles, governmental indeci
