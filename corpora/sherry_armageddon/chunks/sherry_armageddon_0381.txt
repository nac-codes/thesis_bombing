Another writer went so far as to find the preparations a sham perpetrated by embattled Tories who tried to hold onto power by stirring up the fear of war and then making the masses grateful for the peace they arranged. Eliot, too, saw the preparations as “backfires against any possible flaring-up of public resistance to the policy upon which the [French and English] governments had determined.”®°  If anything, the Europeans’ panic about air war confirmed a conclusion already formed from observations in Spain and China: the potency of air war on cities lay more in its threat than in its actual use; its value was more political than military. Employing the bomber for psychological terror and political intimidation appeared to be ushering in a new kind of political—military war of nerves, a kind of war to which “fascist” or “totalitarian” governments were especially inclined and for which they were especially adept. Archibald MacLeish, the American poet and playwright, gave expression to this notion in his radio play, Air Raid, evoking the fascist threat and challenging illusions of invulnerability to which he thought people still clung. An observer of the Spanish civil war regarded the bombing of cities as “the instrument of the dictator, rather than the general.
