ruthlessness to harness the psychological terror of the bomber to a broader scheme of intimidation and subversion, while holding their own populations in check during an agonizing war of nerves. The fact that the Luftwaffe was the most visibly nazified branch of the German armed forces may have lent credence to this line of reasoning. Some analysts added a further point: because fascist countries lacked the discipline, patience, or resources to win by a protracted conventional war—an accurate prediction, though in conflict with the image of ironclad control over populations—they would be all the more inclined to grab for a cheap victory by resorting to terror.S2 Opinions differed about whether the resort to ter- ror would work and whether it reflected fascist stupidity or cunning, desperation or design. Agreement was widespread, however, that bombing cities had a special place in the hearts of fascists.  Debate on air war had taken on a political complexion that was largely missing in the 1920s, when its eventual employment was regarded as possible by all nations, regardless of their political forms or ideology. In one more way, the danger of air war had become both magnified and circumscribed—magnified in that the Axis powers now loomed as a force lacking scruples in the resort to air war, but circumscribed insofar as its use by other nations, its role as a universal weapon of war, had faded from debate. The widespread opinion in the late thirties that the Western democracies lagged far behind Germany and Italy in the development of strategic air power strengthened this perspective. So, too, did the resounding denunciations of bombing in China and Spain made by the press and by the governments of the democracies and the general emphasis on the defensive nature of British and American preparations for air war. Bombing cities was something that only fascist govern- ments, foolishly or not, attempted.  The rise of the fascist powers and their air raids on cities were
