likelihood or consequences, moral or selfish, of using it. They entered World War II with an impoverished legacy of concern about air war, with few standards by which to judge its wisdom, indeed with little feeling that standards were needed. Millis’s characterization of Americans’ attitudes toward their future security by 1938 applies nicely to their consid- eration of the bomber as well: “Thus the shadow of the future was already plain; but there was nothing with which to give it substance.”68  Arguably, different American responses to the bomber would have made little difference. In facing Germany, the English never had the Americans’ luxury of freedom from retaliation. Too, the RAF, an independent service since 1918, had less need for the self-justifying theorizing about strategic air war that characterized American airmen. It operated in an atomosphere of more urgent and sophisticated concern about the prospect of air war and the possibility that air war might be less conclusive than either the prophets or skeptics had allowed. Yet before the war the English placed great emphasis on the strategic bomber, and during the war the RAF would use the bomber with a vindictiveness unexcelled by Americans. In short, a richer legacy of debate in England did nothing to di-  Page 72 of 368 17%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON was dubious, their methods involved psychological intimidation more than physical destruction, and the moral burden was now comfortably shifted to their shoulders. More reasonable men presum- ably recognized the futility of indiscriminate destruction.  The possibility of sustained war against cities simply eluded most people. After decades of debate, bombing cities still appeared either as the ultimate weapon or as a futile, desperate gesture. Sustained slaughter, for rational or irrational reasons, remained barely imaginable. These limits on imagination are, in retrospect, unsurprising, inasmuch as they largely remain in f
