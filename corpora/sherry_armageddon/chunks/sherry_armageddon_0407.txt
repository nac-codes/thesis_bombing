of Intimidation  Writing from Paris at the height of the Munich crisis, Ambassador William Bullitt offered President Roosevelt a pithy summary of Munich’s lessons: “If you have enough airplanes you don’t have to go to Berchtesgaden.”! Roosevelt understood the message. In varying ways he acted on it during the three years following the crisis of September 1938. Once again, however, contemplation of aerial holo- caust and preparation to wage it easily diverged.  After the Munich crisis, it is true, the British, German, and American air forces all moved, in fumbling and differing ways, toward the use of the bomber on enemy cities. Yet from the American perspective, the specter of air war if anything continued to recede. In part this was because other considerations still intruded. Too, reports from abroad continued to suggest that the bomber, at least as a weapon of attack on civilian masses, was less terrifying in actuality than it had been in anticipation. More than that, while fear of air war remained, the bomber’s deterrent value outweighed its actual military employment in American calculations. Especially in meeting the crisis in the Far East, American policymakers found the bomber an alluring instrument for minimizing, even averting, American participation in war. The mobilization of American air power rapidly accelerated without forcing attention to the terrors and limits of its use.  THE LESSONS OF “INTERNATIONAL BLACKMAIL”  In Europe, the prospect of aerial holocaust was one reason that the British and French governments appeased Hitler’s demands for the Sudetenland. With Barcelona’s bombing still vividly recalled, the decisiveness of a German knockout aerial blow against the capitals of the democracies was unquestioned by the summer of 1938. “We cannot expose ourselves now to a German attack” a leading English general put it. “We simply commit suicide if we do. “ France’s leaders feared that in the event of war “French cities would be laid in ruins” whose l
