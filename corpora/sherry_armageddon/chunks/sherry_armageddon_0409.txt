ars. Visitors to Germany like the RAF’s Hugh Trenchard and America’s Charles Lindbergh confirmed high-level expectations of sudden, irresistible destruction at the Luftwaffe’s hands. Lindbergh, though technically astute, failed to realize that the Luftwaffe’s primary orientation was tactical; correctives provided by obscure American military attachés received little attention.  Yet the decisive factor in the nail-biting summer of 1938 was not these exaggerated reports or the artful Nazi threats but the credulity of the audience that received them. Memories of panic during the Great War, years of scare literature, and distrust of the masses all came together in the Munich crisis. Perhaps there was even a measure of satisfaction in the fear of German attack, inasmuch as it had long been a promise of air power that “the very magnitude of the disaster ... may prove to be a restraining influence,” that is, that the bomber’s frightfulness might deter war itself.4 In Eng- land and France, a war-scarred generation welcomed as much as it feared the notion of a devastating air attack from Germany, lest Europe plunge again into the horrors experienced in World War I.  Roosevelt had played only a marginal role in the drama of Munich. But he observed keenly, learned quickly, and snatched the promise of American air power out of the debacle. For months he had received occasional reports on the apparent disparity between the Luftwaffe and the air forces of Germany’s opponents and on the decisive role that disparity was coming to play. They came from American aircraft manufacturers, from foreign visitors to the White House, and most of all from Lindbergh and his intermediaries with the White House, Joseph Kennedy (FDR’s ambassador to Eng- land) and Bullitt (ambassador to France), both also in touch with the frightened leaders of the European democracies.  Of these channels, Lindbergh was at once the most troublesome and the most fruitful. He made three publicized trips to Germany,
