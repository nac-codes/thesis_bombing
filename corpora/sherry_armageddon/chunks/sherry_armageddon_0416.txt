welcomed as much as it feared the notion of a devastating air attack from Germany, lest Europe plunge again into the horrors experienced in World War I.  Roosevelt had played only a marginal role in the drama of Munich. But he observed keenly, learned quickly, and snatched the promise of American air power out of the debacle. For months he had received occasional reports on the apparent disparity between the Luftwaffe and the air forces of Germany’s opponents and on the decisive role that disparity was coming to play.
