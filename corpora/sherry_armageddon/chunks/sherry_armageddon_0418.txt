His interest shifted to a second role for air power, that of a tool for deterrence and diplomacy. Munich, however depressing for the moment, also opened tantalizing possibilities for FDR. The challenge was not simply to forestall its repetition but to seize a leaf from Hitler’s notebook.  Helping the British and French to rebuild their air forces was one way. Even before Munich the French had placed a small order for American planes and acknowledged their hopes for pur- chasing many more.
