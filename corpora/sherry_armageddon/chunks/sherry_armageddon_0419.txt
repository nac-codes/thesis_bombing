on October 14 Roosevelt announced his intention to revise American defense plans and seek additional military funds (eventually the figure of $500 million was set). Privately, he began tossing about extravagant figures for an expanded American air force. By November 14, at a key meeting with eleven subordinates, he had settled on the round number of ten thousand planes for the American air force and a capacity to produce another ten thousand each year.?  This was “a bolt from the blue,” something far beyond the airmen’s own plans for expansion that autumn. Arnold recorded that Roosevelt sought “a striking force to back United States foreign policies,” arguing that a ground army “would not be considered in the light of a deterrent by any foreign power, whereas a heavy striking force of aircraft would.” Morgenthau set down FDR's ideas in all their boldness. Emphasizing that “sending a large army abroad was undesirable and politically out of the question,” even for hemisphere defense, Roosevelt saw air power as an instrument of nego- tiation and intimidation:  “Tam not sure now that I am proud of what I wrote to Hitler in urging that he sit down around the table and make peace. That may have saved many, many lives now, but that may ultimately result in the loss of many times that number of lives later. When I write to foreign countries I must have something to back up my words. Had we had this summer 5,000 planes and the capacity immediately to pro- duce 10,000 per year, even though I might have had to ask Congress for authority to sell or lend them to the countries in Europe, Hitler would not have dared to take the stand he did.”  Or as Arnold later paraphrased the president:  the President came straight out for air power. Airplanes—now—and lots of them! ... A new regiment of field artillery, or new barracks at an Army post in Wyoming, or new machine tools in an ordnance arsenal, he said sharply, would not scare Hitler one blankety-blank-blank bit! What he wanted was
