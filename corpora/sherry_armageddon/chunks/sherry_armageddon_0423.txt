that rearmament maximize employment in an economy in renewed recession and mindful of the political advantages of economic stimulation. Roosevelt, of course, flatly denied such intentions, telling the press that “national defense is national defense and nothing else.” In private he baldly confided his political motives. “These foreign orders” for airplanes, Morgenthau recorded the president as saying, “mean prosperity in this country and we can’t elect a Democratic Party unless we get prosperity.... Let’s be perfectly frank.” 3  Yet Roosevelt’s initiatives, congruent as they were with schemes he had entertained before the onset of the 1938 recession, clearly had a larger purpose.

His post-Munich initiatives developed these possibilities, albeit with a shift in focus to air power. Roosevelt imagined the United States playing a decisive role in shaping world events without embarking on all-out war.
