d antifascist nations with its industrial, naval, and air power, harnessing American power to the energies of other nations on the front lines without overtaxing American patience, pocketbooks, and personnel.  It is futile to wonder whether, in the three years after Munich, Roosevelt was seeking to prevent war or to prepare for American participation in it, for FDR, ever one to keep his options open, had both possibilities in mind. More than that, he sought to stake out a gray area in between these two choices, to define methods of undeclared war that might secure the fruits of intervention without inflicting its full costs. Likewise, it is futile to speculate whether Roosevelt’s simultaneous efforts to rearm Britain and France and expand the American air force were intentionally, even deviously, confused so that he could aid allies abroad without offending isolationists at home. American rearmament was hardly a subterfuge for aiding others. Indeed, Roosevelt openly surmounted the obstacles to French orders from American factories. In doing so, he ultimately served the unilateral objective of speeding buildup of the Army Air Corps. If anything, foreign orders bootlegged Ameri- can rearmament.  Roosevelt too stubbornly pursued both aid to the French and rearmament at home to permit an argument that one held clear priority. His fondness for power, his conception of national interest, and his contempt for the Anglo-French performance at Munich left him in no mood to trust that effete allies had the tenacity to deter or fight Hitler if only America would generously supply the sinews of war.
