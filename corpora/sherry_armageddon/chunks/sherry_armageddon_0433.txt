bly into methods of war, although he was not ready to abandon efforts at diplomacy and disarmament hitherto tried and found wanting.15  For Roosevelt’s purposes, air power seemed an ideal instrument, decisive yet humane, for deterring, limiting, or at the worst, waging war. Meanwhile, it also served American and hemispheric defense, objectives so uncontroversial that the expansion of American air power could proceed with minimal opposition. In short, Roosevelt had gathered together and turned to his purposes the benign images of bombardment aviation and the malignant images of warfare on the ground. And inasmuch as war-fighting uses of aviation seemed remote, rearmament in the air entailed no urgent consideration of the bomber’s morality and utility. Therefore Roosevelt’s new aerial policy squared with the dominant prejudices and priorities of Americans: alarm over fascist aggression, aversion to military expeditions abroad, desire to preserve American isolation, and faith in aviation as a benign technology.  Insofar as public opinion polls measured those priorities and prejudices, they were still too imperfectly formed to guide Roosevelt easily. Within a broad consensus for rearmament indicated by a November 1938 survey, 90 percent of Americans supported an increased air force, 86 percent a larger navy, 82 percent a bigger army. Only later did opinion polls suggest firmer preferences for air power: in June 1941, 73 percent of respondents preferred to strengthen the air force, only 16 percent the navy and 11 percent the army; by small but consistent margins Americans preferred to deploy  Page 80 of 368 19%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON Koosevelt too stubpornly pursued botn aida to tne Frencn and rearmament at home to permit an argument tnat one held Clear priority.
