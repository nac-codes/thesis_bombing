one held Clear priority. H1s ronaness for power, Nis conception of national interest,  and his contempt for the Anglo-French performance at Munich left him in no mood to trust that effete allies had the tenacity to deter or fight Hitler if only America would generously supply the sinews of war. His sneer that Britain had “cringed like a coward” and caved in to “complete despair” hardly ruled out continued aid but did indicate FDR's sense of its limited utility. On January 31, 1939, Morgenthau, himself keenly interested in the French orders, told Roosevelt that “for your international speeches to be effective, you must be backed up with the best air fleet in the world.” His words suggested again the administration’s quest for American power that Munich had done much to accelerate. Roosevelt’s references to the baleful effects of Wilson’s military weakness in 1914 and 1917 indicated much the same temper.!4  Roosevelt’s concept of the indivisibility of peace also argued for a more powerful and visible American deterrent. He preached “that no nation can be safe in its will to peace so long as any other powerful nation refuses to settle its grievances at the council table.” Peace was a seamless fabric, especially because of economic and technological advances that marked a break with the past. Even before the outbreak of blitzkrieg warfare, he was stressing how “the world has grown so small and weapons of attack so swift.” Such language, now abstract but soon to be laced with pointed references to the impact of air power, outlined the technological rationale for a global definition of national security. The United States could respond to global insecurity by “many methods short of war, but stronger and more effective than mere words,” Roosevelt promised.
