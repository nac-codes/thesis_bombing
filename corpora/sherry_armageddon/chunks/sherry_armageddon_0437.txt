Through the fall of 1938 at least, grand pronouncements about the necessity of arresting aggression and rearming America were matched by stern refusal to go into details or even sketch broad strategies, except on the uncontroversial priority of hemisphere defense. At the November 14 conference, Morgenthau scotched FDR's suggestion that he go public on European air strengths as a way of mobilizing public opinion, for Morgenthau feared that the figures would only justify Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement in the public’s eyes—a sign that the administration accepted claims of German air superiority longer than much of the press. Press coverage of the November 14 conference first emphasized Roosevelt’s interest in the economic impact of rearmament, then shifted to defense issues, but Roosevelt left the impression that the context was “continental” defense. Asked what was “the new danger which makes this continental defense necessary,” he fliply responded, “Read the newspapers for the past five years.” He left to his assistant secretary of war, Louis Johnson, the task of making a public call for quadrupling the American air force, but even Johnson offered a rationale that was strictly defensive.18  By January, Roosevelt had inched forward with his call for “methods short of war” and for specific legislation on rearmament.
