not ready to abandon efforts at diplomacy and disarmament hitherto tried and found wanting.1>  For Roosevelt’s purposes, air power seemed an ideal instrument, decisive yet humane, for deterring, limiting, or at the worst, waging war. Meanwhile, it also served American and hemispheric defense, objectives so uncontroversial that the expansion of American air power could proceed with minimal opposition. In short, Roosevelt had gathered together and turned to his purposes the benign images of bombardment aviation and the malignant images of warfare on the ground. And inasmuch as war-fighting uses of aviation seemed remote, rearmament in the air entailed no urgent consideration of the bomber’s morality and utility. Therefore Roosevelt’s new aerial policy squared with the dominant prejudices and priorities of Americans: alarm over fascist aggression, aversion to military expeditions abroad, desire to preserve American isolation, and faith in aviation as a benign technology.  Insofar as public opinion polls measured those priorities and prejudices, they were still too imperfectly formed to guide Roosevelt easily. Within a broad consensus for rearmament indicated by a November 1938 survey, 90 percent of Americans supported an increased air force, 86 percent a larger navy, 82 percent a bigger army. Only later did opinion polls suggest firmer preferences for air power: in June 1941, 73 percent of respondents preferred to strengthen the air force, only 16 percent the navy and 11 percent the army; by small but consistent margins Americans preferred to deploy naval and air power rather than ground armies in the event of their entry into the European war; weeks after Pearl Harbor, Gallup found Americans wanting to spend money on airplanes rather than on battleships by an eight-to-one margin. In November 1938, Roosevelt was intuitively anticipating and shaping the preferences Americans were coming to hold, not responding to a clear-cut mandate.1&  Similarly, subjective readings o
