e margin. In November 1938, Roosevelt was intuitively anticipating and shaping the preferences Americans were coming to hold, not responding to a clear-cut mandate.1&  Similarly, subjective readings of public opinion offered him little guidance, insofar as printed commentary on the Munich crisis represented confusing messages on how Americans judged the role of air power. The glossy press graphically conveyed the Europeans’ fear of air war but said little about how that fear affected settlement of the Munich crisis. Life ridiculed claims of German air superiority as a ridiculous “yarn.” Hitler’s “victory without war,” as the New York Times put it, was impressive but not often attributed to the threat of bombing. Unusual was the New Republic’s careful distinction between the reality of German air power (which it discounted) and the fear of that power: “For twenty years,” Bruce Bliven wrote, “people have been told about the horrors of aerial warfare against helpless civilians,” and their fear was now of “tremendous significance.” By 1939 George Fielding Eliot was emphasizing that the Luftwaffe’s strength, however limited, had been a supreme weapon of “international blackmail” at Munich, abetted by English authorities who carried out air raid protection with “an air of ghoulish ostentation.” Likewise in 1939, Lewis Mumford warned of the “irrational forces” that governed in crisis: “It was the five thousand airplanes that Germany did not possess, added to the five thousand that they may doubtfully have had, that aided in the Berch- tesgaden betrayal.” But these sharper readings of Munich’s meaning emerged slowly and offered no clear suggestion that Washington should copy Berlin’s methods.12  In this climate of diffuse public opinion Roosevelt moved cautiously and sometimes confusingly. Through the fall of 1938 at least, grand pronouncements about the necessity of arresting aggression and rearming America were matched by stern refusal to go into details or even sketch br
