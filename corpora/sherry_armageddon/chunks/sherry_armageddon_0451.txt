purposes. In doing so, they supported the big bomber air force that Air Corps officers wanted, and they smoothed Roosevelt’s path toward creating a deterrent force even as they carped at his immediate plans.  Encountering only oblique public opposition to his plans, Roosevelt faced a more formidable threat from within his administration, ironically from the military and the Air Corps itself. Air Corps’ resistance to French orders was a bitter point of conflict. Arnold, promoted by FDR to chief of the Air Corps in September, accepted foreign orders in principle but sharply contested the way Roosevelt handled them, especially the end run Roosevelt made around the army by delegating Morgenthau to supervise foreign orders. When Arnold felt he had to take the heat publicly for the controversy raised by the crash of the Douglas bomber, his bitterness toward Morgenthau deepened. Arnold grudgingly acknowledged the benefits to the Air Corps of foreign purchases but remained suspicious that the French were stealing technological secrets. The conflict dragged on until March 1940, when Roosevelt, “looking directly at me .. . said there were places to which officers who did not’play ball’ might be sent, such as Guam.” “Oh boy, did General Arnold get it,” Morgenthau gleefully recorded. The French got what they wanted, joining the British in ordering forty-six hundred air- frames and thirteen thousand engines to add to a smaller order negotiated the previous year—though little arrived in time to do the French much good.24  The president and his military staff also clashed over his plans for American rearmament. After decades of budgets they deemed miserly, military leaders welcomed the money Roosevelt wanted appropriated but forcefully challenged his priorities for spending it. George Marshall, newly appointed as Deputy Chief of Staff, took the lead for the army at the November 14 conference in a notable confrontation in which Roosevelt, for the first and last time, addressed the
