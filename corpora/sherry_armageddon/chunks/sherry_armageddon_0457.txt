logistical and training needs of the Air Corps. That left only $180 million for airplanes—a staggering sum by contemporary standards but enough for just 3,032 new planes (only half of them combat types), which would bring up the Air Corps to 5,500 by the end of 1940. Like other political leaders at this time—including Hitler, who now vainly sought to create the air force his enemies thought he had—Roosevelt could not force a decisive break with the military’s traditional views on strategy.26  Marshall himself at times sounded almost old-fashioned on the issue of air power.
