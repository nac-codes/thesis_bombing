what Hitler had accomplished with air power and what the United States might do. But his admiration for Hitler’s achievement showed.2®  Lieutenant Colonel Donald Wilson, another officer at the tactical school, carried Kuter’s argument a step further. Wilson anticipated “future ‘Munichs” for which the United States should prepare by acquiring long-range bombers. Hitler had “the vision required to build an air force of heretofore unheard of proportions and at Munich it won without a struggle.” The United States should not “miss the import of air striking power in the more recent bloodless wars,” Wilson argued: “What could be better than a force so strong that actual conflict is thereby avoided?” Wilson envisioned using American air power to defend interests and policies beyond the hemisphere, in a manner close to Roosevelt’s thinking. Wilson, however, looked not to Europe but to the Far East, citing the Panay incident as the kind of defeat that air power would have averted “by the presence in Alaska of an air force capable of exerting critical pressure against Japanese home territory. Crazy? Yes, crazy again —the same way that Hitler was crazy. ... The sort of craziness that becomes a rational reality in light of the happenings at Munich. This sort of craziness does seem to be a powerful weapon in the new order of international relations.” In short Munich warranted emulation as well as regret over Hitler’s success. The key to air power’s utility was not its use but the very irrationality of threatening to use it.31  Page 85 of 368 20%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON British leaders saw opportunity in the very danger the ex-president had identified. An air attack on London would cause “an explosion of American feeling” that would crush isolationism and bring America in on the British side: “Nothing would be so effective as the bombing of London, translated by air [radio broadcasting, that is] to the homes of America.” Figures as diverse as
