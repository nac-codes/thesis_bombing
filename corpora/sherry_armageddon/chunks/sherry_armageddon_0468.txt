power without deploying large armies of occupation which antagonized foreign subjects and drained national resources. The components of this argument for air power were scattered about in Air Corps doctrine but were never convincingly assembled. Airmen, like other officers, routinely identified economic conflict as a prime cause of war. But their dominant focus remained on how to fight wars, not on what a later generation would call politico- military strategy. Then too, some officers rightly doubted whether Americans who preferred their causes to be moral would regard economic interests as worth defending through war. Despite sug- gestive comments earlier by Mitchell and now by younger officers, no one articulated a vision of air power as the instrument of American economic hegemony.23  Thus Roosevelt’s ideas on the diplomatic counterweight that air power might provide were echoed in the Air Corps, particularly among big-bomber advocates, but not strongly enough to capture Roosevelt’s attention. He formed no alliance with the bomber enthusiasts, probably as yet unfamiliar with their ideas.34 Roosevelt also did not enter the continuing fray within the War  Page 85 of 368 20%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  by siding wholly with the president. The air mail fiasco in 1934 provided sufficient reminder of the embarrassment that could result down the line if the Air Corps undertook a mission its supporting apparatus could not sustain. Roosevelt’s plans promised immediate gratification but long-term political and military dangers, loading down the Air Corps with thousands of aircraft for whose rapid obsolescence Arnold would later have to account.  Most of all, differing conceptions of high policy marked the faultline between the Air Corps and Roosevelt more than perceptions of political interest. Not a bold strategic thinker, inclined to see fighting rather than deterring war as his primary task, Arnold did not respond to Roosevelt’s urgency
