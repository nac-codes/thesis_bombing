bombers. In 1938, the Joint Army—Navy Board had prohibited further development of bombers larger than the B-17, and the initiative only resumed in 1939, culminating in the B-29, first flown in 1942 and destined to fire Japanese cities. Potential use of the B-29 against Japan or Germany was recognized by 1939.36 But when the War Department approved the B-29, neither it nor the Joint Board approved such ambitious strategic missions.  The Air Corps was left to build a new air force with hemisphere defense and aid to Britain and France as its only clearly sanctioned strategic missions. To be sure, even those missions, liberally construed added ursencv to its activities and new strategic nlans nrenared hv the Inint Raard cavered a range of contingencies including an offensive ta defeat Germanv and Italv while halding a de-  Page 87 of 368 20%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  PUA Uk Cy Se a Oe Cp CL Ua DU Ly Uy Cn PURE FER CU ES UE UU BE, UU cae UE ALY WR Patssdsdag LU udeea ee pe Ua  German penetration into Latin America once it began. Andrews, citing Munich, proposed something else: “to stop the aggressor nation from even planning the attack, through fear of retaliation.” Air power should be seen not simply as a war-fighting instrument but “as an instrument of national policy,” one capable, as Munich showed, of “toppling the diplomatic balance” and perhaps eventually creating mutual deterrence through terror between two nations both “capable of powerful air action.”32  Officers like Kuter, Wilson, and Andrews were trying to link the aerial weapon to national policy, that is, to justify its potential not only for winning wars but for sustaining peacetime policies. They almost, but not quite, made the link. According to standard Air Corps doctrine, armed forces could serve national policy in three ways: by preserving “national existence” (an obvious function), by assisting “the active acquisition of foreign territory” (ruled out by national re
