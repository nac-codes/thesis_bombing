, Roosevelt called for a production capacity of “at least 50,000 planes a year,” a standing force of naval and military aircraft of the same size, and renewed congressional commitment to the sale of aircraft to Britain and France. Calculated to shock Americans into rethinking their fundamental assumptions about national security, Roosevelt’s address was sprinkled with references to the “swift and deadly” attacks across vast expanses that airplanes could launch. As dramatiza- tion of the primacy of air power, the message was Roosevelt’s boldest.

Two hundred fifty Flying Fortresses were included in the January 1939 program for a fifty-five-hundred-plane air force. But actual orders were limited (seventy B-17s and sixteen B-24s ordered in fiscal 1940) and deliveries were slow. Even those ordered were justifiable under the coast and hemispheric doctrines of the military.3>  Likewise, FDR’s hand was not evident in the Air Corps’ quest for still larger bombers. In 1938, the Joint Army—Navy Board had prohibited further development of bombers larger than the B-17, and the initiative only resumed in 1939, culminating in the B-29, first flown in 1942 and destined to fire Japanese cities. Potential use of the B-29 against Japan or Germany was recognized by 1939.36 But when the War Department approved the B-29, neither it nor the Joint Board approved such ambitious strategic missions.  The Air Corps was left to build a new air force with hemisphere defense and aid to Britain and France as its only clearly sanctioned strategic missions. To be sure, even those missions, liberally construed, added urgency to its activities, and new strategic plans prepared by the Joint Board co
