France as its only clearly sanctioned strategic missions. To be sure, even those missions, liberally construed, added urgency to its activities, and new strategic plans prepared by the Joint Board covered a range of contingencies, including an offensive to defeat Germany and Italy while holding a de- fensive line in the Pacific. But in 1939, Joint Board planning had proceeded in a vacuum, without explicit authorization from the president, who left the strategists to divine his intentions.  Not surprisingly, therefore, airmen largely kept their own counsel in 1939 when they speculated on their strategic mission, working outside the formal structure of strategic planning. Tactical school instructors, still the fountainhead of more radical air doctrine, acknowledged the immediate priority of hemispheric defense but continued to emphasize that selective attacks on an enemy’s economic structure remained the ideal employment of air power. As had been the case throughout the 1930s, the Far East invited vivid speculation on air power’s role, even though European events generated the most concern. On September 1, 1939, Lieutenant Colonel Carl Spaatz, Chief of the Air Corps’ Plans Division, produced for Arnold a sweeping analysis of air strategy in case of conflict with Japan. Ruling out invasion of Japan as both unnecessary and unfeasible, eliminating a naval blockade (a recurrent idea of Roosevelt’s) as difficult and too slow, Spaatz reached the unsurprising conclu- sion that strategic bombers, perhaps based on Luzon, were best fitted for the task. Spaatz offered no details regarding the methods or targets of bombing. But given Japan’s industrialized economy and dense population, he thought it “probable that sustained air attack alone would be sufficient to force Japanese acquiescence in our national policies.” And he added, in an echo of reactions to Munich and a prophecy of plans to come, that “the mere existence” of an American bomber force on Luzon might “restrain Japa
