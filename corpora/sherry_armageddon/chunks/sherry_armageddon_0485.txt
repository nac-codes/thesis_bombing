standing force of naval and military aircraft of the same size, and renewed congressional commitment to the sale of aircraft to Britain and France. Calculated to shock Americans into rethinking their fundamental assumptions about national security, Roosevelt’s address was sprinkled with references to the “swift and deadly” attacks across vast expanses that airplanes could launch.

Gone were the veiled references of the past to a role for American air power in altering the outcome of the struggles in Europe and Asia. The rationale was solely defensive, though defense was broadly conceived.

His objective was “national protection” against “the possibility of attack on vital American zones.” Roosevelt had given bolder expres- sion to the needs of American defense. But a revolutionary growth in air power was given a most traditional rationale.4°  The address did little to guide strategists but much to reopen public debate about air power’s role in preserving American isolation. Some anti-interventionists mixed enthusiasm for air power with condemnation of FDR’s request for fifty thousand planes, puzzled by the anomaly of Roosevelt’s bold call for such a huge force to serve such limited ends. Critics like the aviator Al Williams suspected deceit. “The airplanes are for Europe.” Williams flatly declared, arguing that Roosevelt was “creating panic and terror” in order to secure planes for the British and plunge the nation into war. No other explanation seemed credible to those who preached that economy of force was the supreme virtue of air power: a few hundred or a few thousand planes could insulate the Americas from at- tack, an attack whose likelihood
