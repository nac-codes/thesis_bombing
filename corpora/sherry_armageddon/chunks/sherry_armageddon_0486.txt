credible to those who preached that economy of force was the supreme virtue of air power: a few hundred or a few thousand planes could insulate the Americas from at- tack, an attack whose likelihood Williams disparaged in any event.41  Skewed by issues more political than strategic, the renewed debate on air power again informed Americans poorly about the role air power might play in the escalating world war. It was further skewed by Lindbergh, now at the center of resistance to Roosevelt, who believed that “this youngster . . . has accepted Nazi methods.” Lindbergh’s criticisms of Roosevelt, however strident, were not always myopic. He caught the incipient globalism of Roosevelt’s policy. “If we say that our frontier lies on the Rhine, they can say that theirs lies on the Mississippi,” he argued. But Lindbergh’s views on air power—widely publicized and endowed with his prestige as pioneer in the air—were unenlightening about the issues Americans would face should they enter the war. Echoing the Mitchell of the midtwenties, he celebrated the invulnerability of the United States to attack by sea or air. A relatively small force—ten thousand frontline planes—could guard the approaches to America. Transatlan- tic attacks would some day be feasible but were of no immediate worry. “The Air defense of America is as simple as the attack is difficult.”42  Yet once again anti-interventionists like Lindbergh prepared the ground for Roosevelt’s developing emphasis on air power. It was precisely hemispheric defense that Roosevelt was now emphasizing. Lindbergh could haggle about the numbers of planes needed, but both politics and personal experience compelled him to embrace air power. Indeed, Lindbergh particularly favored the development of long-range bombers to provide an aerial version of the naval “chastity belt” around the Americas that Roosevelt had already proclaimed. Intent on keeping the United States out of war, Lindbergh did not explore what role those bombers might
