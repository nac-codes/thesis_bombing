Nor did he pay much attention to Germany’s air blitz, if only because England’s successful resistance undercut his argument that aid to the Allies was futile. Between Roosevelt and Lindbergh, as between interventionists and their critics more generally, the danger and potential of the bomber were less an issue than the common coin spent to sustain political positions. This pattern persisted up to Pearl Harbor in public discourse. Air power was at once alluring, relatively noncontroversial, easily lost in the vortex of issues swirl- ing across the United States, such as well-worn controversies over creating an independent air force and the navy’s role in the air age.42  Some popular writers tried to be more informed.
