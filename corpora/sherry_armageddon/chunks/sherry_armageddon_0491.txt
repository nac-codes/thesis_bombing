the invulnerability and precision of bombers remained intact: “They can no more be completely stopped once they have taken the air than the big shell can be stopped once it has left the muzzle.” Predictions of future bombers “spreading death and destruction 5,000 miles away” mixed with the language of precision bombing. Here, then, were confused admissions of the role bombers might play. A succeeding volume, Army Flyer (1942), written before Pearl Harbor but published after it, clarified little. In the free market of strategies, good uses of the bomber would drive out the bad, although the bomber’s objective included “lastly the people, the workers.” In any event, there was the familiar promise that air power’s virtue transcended its actual use: its “threat ... can accomplish without dropping a bomb the breakdown of opposing diplomatic morale.”45  Popular literature, then, gave only a sidelong glance at the potential uses of American air power. So, too, did reporting on the actual air war in Europe. That war began in earnest in the summer of 1940 through a series of escalations undertaken by both sides. As early as July 8, Churchill had called for “an absolutely devastating, exterminating attack” on Germany, and he sanctioned the first raid against Berlin on August 25. By then, German planning to bomb English cities had already begun; night attacks, initiated on September 7, continued until tapering off in 1941, when the Luftwaffe turned against British shipping and prepared to move east. Neither side had a well-conceived rationale for bombing the other’s cities. Hitler’s intentions were particularly murky, unless he thought that terror alone was to suffice, which it was not. The British at least had a strategic doctrine and now also the sense of “a supreme emergency” justifying the bombing of Germany’s cities; but the argument that such bombing was an unavoidable necessity overlooked what the bombers could have done in North African operations and in the critical
