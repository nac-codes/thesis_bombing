possessed a supreme opportunity for enlightening Americans about air war on cities. Radio had seized first place in the homes of Americans as the medium for reporting events abroad and for heightening awareness of them. Having become virtual “tools of the administration” in their undisguised sympathy for the Allies and for American intervention,‘” radio’s best journalists, like Edward R.

Correspondents did not face so starkly the problems encountered on the battlefield or the seas: rapid movement, disruption of electronic communications, military censor- ship, impenetrable confusion. For this kind of war, at least as a friendly nation experienced it, they had a front-row seat. Immediacy was almost total.  Some, like Murrow, exploited it brilliantly for the commercial, artistic, and political purposes that guided them. As Archibald MacLeish said of Murrow, “You burned the city of London in our homes and we felt the flames that burned it... . You destroyed the superstition of distance and of time.” Yet these purposes also turned the prism away from possible horrors. Insofar as Murrow “made Americans think of the Battle of Britain as a prelude to the bombing of New York or Washington,” as his best critic puts it, he reinforced the paradigm of defense in which Americans viewed their approach to war.

Murrow, standing on the rooftops of London, himself personified resistance, and he communicated the less evident attractions of air war: the awe it inspired, the rallying of the spirit it induced, the national bonding it
