air was filled by Robert Lovett, brought in by War Secretary Henry L. Stimson to rationalize industry’s chaotic mo- bilization for aircraft production. In June 1941, creation of the Army Air Forces (Arnold again as Chief) marked another step toward the twin goals of air force autonomy and equality.  Mirroring these changes was a movement toward decisive acceptance by high officials of strategic air power. To be sure, the process was erratic, buffeted by demands of allies, manifold problems of mobilization, organizational confusion and service rivalries, military conservatism, and the casualness of Roosevelt’s direction. Neither the money nor the productive capacity was there to turn out fifty thousand planes within a year, and the War Department quickly trimmed that figure. At that, production targets could not be met. In one week in November 1940, the Air Corps received only two combat aircraft from industry; nine months later it was still “a virtually unarmed air force.” Even if production goals could be met, their value was in doubt because strategic timetables were unfathomable: a quick “triumph of mass production would, paradoxically, bring the danger of defeat by obsolescence—unless war arrived soon enough to absorb the full output of the clattering as- sembly lines.”52  And yet in this confusion Roosevelt, in his own way, did lead. His fifty-thousand-plane objective, inspired by fondness for the psychological value of impressive numbers, was almost wholly his figure, dwarfing recommendations from service officers unready to think so big.*3 By stressing sheer numbers, Roosevelt intuitively grasped that the key to victory in the emerging air war was economic productivity and bureaucratic efficiency, not strategic genius.54 He also directed energies where the military bureaucracy was most comfortable expending them: on the technical and economic problems of how to mobilize air power, not on the moral, political, and strategic issues of how to employ it.
