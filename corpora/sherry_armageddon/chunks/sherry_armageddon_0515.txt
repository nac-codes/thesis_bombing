ry bureaucracy was most comfortable expending them: on the technical and economic problems of how to mobilize air power, not on the moral, political, and strategic issues of how to employ it. A focus on mobilization muted the vexing debate on whether or how to enter the war, responded to the anxieties of military officers who shared memories of failed mobilization during the last war, and deflected attention away from the thorny issue of the air force’s role and mis- sion. Emphasizing mobilization, Roosevelt found the lowest common denominator of thinking about air power.  At the same time, he signaled his strategic priority for long-range bombers, but, as usual, in a piecemeal and private way that minimized controversy. In June 1940 he told military planners how he imagined “the United States in the war, but with naval and air forces only,” plus aid to allies. That fall he finally let Arnold out of the “dog house” and back into the White House. In February, the State Department pressed on the White House a document derived from German sources characterizing the Nazis’ economic situation as “desperate” and highly vulnerable to strategic bombing. And on May 4, 1941, FDR ordered a speedup of heavy bomber production to five hundred per month in order to provide “command of the air by the democracies.” This was paralleled by the heavy propor- tion of research and development budgets the army was now devoting to the heavy bomber.*>  By the summer of 1941, Roosevelt was returning full circle to the thoughts he had offered in the midst of the Munich crisis. His hope in the interim years to deter or at least contain hostilities through aerial rearmament had been dashed, at least for Europe. But if the airplane had not deterred war, it might yet win it, as he had speculated in September 1938. So Churchill informed Roosevelt in July, arguing that bombing might “produce an internal convulsion or collapse” in Germany. So the president seemed to argue in talking to Hopkins, who
