gave cogent exposition to a Europe-first strategy. He identified defense of Britain, victory in the Atlantic, and defeat of Germany as priorities, while the United States should avert war in the Pacific and assume only a defensive posture there if it came. Roosevelt neither authorized Stark’s memorandum nor formally approved the results but he tacitly accepted it as the basis of upcoming talks with British planners. Strategy now had a formal definition.5?  American—British deliberations, conducted in secret in Washington from January 29 to March 29, 1941, reaffirmed the broad outlines of Stark’s approach and sanctioned strategic air power in the waging of the war. To be sure, compromises were made and differences remained.

His hope in the interim years to deter or at least contain hostilities through aerial rearmament had been dashed, at least for Europe. But if the airplane had not deterred war, it might yet win it, as he had speculated in September 1938. So Churchill informed Roosevelt in July, arguing that bombing might “produce an internal convulsion or collapse” in Germany. So the president seemed to argue in talking to Hopkins, who in August 1941 characterized FDR as
