Both British and German bombing had already shown how strategic air war might degenerate into futile barbarism. Supremely confident in their day bombers, the American air planners did not address this danger or the possibility that even successful precision strikes might fail to paralyze the German economy.

The British could fight with little else but the bomber and their navy for the
