after American entry into the war, the main assault by an American force of four thousand bombers would “in six months bring much of her [Germany’s] vital industry to ruin.” The principal targets would be Germany’s electric power system, its transportation network, and its petroleum industry.®2  Far more sophisticated than the speculations of airmen in the 1930s, AWPD/1 was nonetheless hastily prepared and ambiguous on some critical points. Both British and German bombing had already shown how strategic air war might degenerate into futile barbarism. Supremely confident in their day bombers, the American air planners did not address this danger or the possibility that even successful precision strikes might fail to paralyze the German economy. True, they did not rule out “heavy and sustained bombing of cities” as a kind of coup de grace climaxing the success of economic attacks or decisive German setback in ground fighting. But throughout the 1930s their strategic arguments had rested on the moral assumption that precision bombing would bring swift, economical, and humane victory. The justification for strategic bombing was the alternative it offered to the carnage of ground warfare. In 1941 the air strategists saw no reason to challenge that as- sumption. Brushing aside the English and German experiences in 1940 and 1941, they felt no need to review the moral issue.®  Their pressing concerns were neither strategic nor moral but political and economic. Their attention flowed to threading AWPD/1 through the channels of the conservative general staff and to mobilizing industry for the war. To the air planners’ relief, Marshall gave AWPD/1 his approval, steered it around the Joint Board, and sent it on to a sympathetic Stimson. The general staff still believed that destruction of the enemy’s ground armies was the only sure path to victory. But doubts about the survival of Britain and Russia ran large in the War Department, making a land invasion of the Continent seem
