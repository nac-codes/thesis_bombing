The few American carriers in the Pacific, they complained, could only “deliver a bombing attack so ineffectual that its value would be less than as though it were undelivered but retained as a constant threat to the Japanese people.” Pinprick attacks “might even raise Japanese morale and thus free their naval forces for work in the South.” Implicitly, the Americans accepted the value of both aerial deterrence and actual attacks on Japanese cities. Weeks later, Stark half-seriously proposed the cruise of a powerful naval force through the North Pacific, mindful of Japan’s “unholy fear of bombing.” But the moment hardly seemed ripe for carrier action, when the British suggested it or at any time in 1941.71  Instead, Washington began moving toward employment of land-based air power to deter Japan or wage war against it. This was the most daring development in American Far Eastern strategy in the year before Pearl Harbor, though its origins remain obscured by the loss of records and the bureaucratic confusion that characterized the American government in 1941.” Broadly, three threads of planning, knit together by a sense of strategic desperation, converged in 1941: the older, casual speculation on the susceptibility of Japan to aerial intimidation; the strategists’ rather sudden inter-  woe tablets a a SS  Page 100 of 368 23%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  there,” but he believed, like Stimson and Arnold, that more likely the effort “would be a big waste.” Worse, any bombers sent to China would undermine commitments to the British. As Marshall complained, “We would be asking them to delay for months the ability to bomb large cities all over Europe with facility—Berlin, Milan, even the oil fields in Roumania.” All that Morgenthau could work out with the War Department was the dispatch of one hundred pursuit planes.®&  Currie and Che
