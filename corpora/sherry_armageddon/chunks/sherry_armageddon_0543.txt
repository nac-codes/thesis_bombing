over Europe with facility—Berlin, Milan, even the oil fields in Roumania.” All that Morgenthau could work out with the War Department was the dispatch of one hundred pursuit planes.®&  Currie and Chennault were too zealous to let the matter rest. In May 1941 they revived the plan for “occasional incendiary bombings of Japan.” Roosevelt agreed once more, but the War Department again thought it impractical. Ensnared by departmental obstructions, air aid to China continued, but never beyond handfuls of second-rate bombers. Like so many American plans for China during the war, this one proved to be an enthusiasm of the moment, fervently embraced but soon forgotten.§2  Enthusiasm for air power continued despite abandonment of the China plan. Significantly it often infected civilians more than military officials, in part because civilian leaders tended to place more faith than officers in any form of deterrent—hence repeated proposals from Roosevelt for various forms of naval action as well. The president urged his strategists to consider “the possibility of bombing attacks [from aircraft carriers] against Japanese cities.” He also apparently prompted Stark to ask Admiral Husband Kimmel in Hawaii to “study very carefully the matter of making aircraft raids on the inflammable Japanese cities (ostensibly on military objectives), and the effect such raids might have on Japanese morale and on the diversion of their forces away from the Malay barrier.” Stark had doubts about the usefulness of such raids but added, in a clear reference to Roosevelt, that “you and I may be ordered” to have a plan for them ready, noting too a “rising tide” of public pres- sure for action against Japan.72  Stark may also have been reflecting British pressures for action. A “really effective” air attack on Japan’s cities, London’s spokesmen suggested, “might well result in a public demand for the return of Japanese forces from theatres vital to us.” They proposed using air power not precisely to d
