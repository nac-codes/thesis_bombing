ck on Japan’s cities, London’s spokesmen suggested, “might well result in a public demand for the return of Japanese forces from theatres vital to us.” They proposed using air power not precisely to deter war but at least to contain it cheaply so that the Anglo-Americans could keep top priority on Europe, an approach similar to Roosevelt’s. But American officers, testy as always about British measures to lure American forces into the western Pacific, outlined their fish-or-cut-bait position: in- decisive action seemed worse than none at all. The few American carriers in the Pacific, they complained, could only “deliver a bombing attack so ineffectual that its value would be less than as though it were undelivered but retained as a constant threat to the Japanese people.” Pinprick attacks “might even raise Japanese morale and thus free their naval forces for work in the South.” Implicitly, the Americans accepted the value of both aerial deterrence and actual attacks on Japanese cities. Weeks later, Stark half-seriously proposed the cruise of a powerful naval force through the North Pacific, mindful of Japan’s “unholy fear of bombing.” But the moment hardly seemed ripe for carrier action, when the British suggested it or at any time in 1941.2  Instead, Washington began moving toward employment of land-based air power to deter Japan or wage war against it. This was the most daring development in American Far Eastern strategy in the year before Pearl Harbor, though its origins remain obscured by the loss of records and the bureaucratic confusion that characterized the American government in 1941.72 Broadly, three threads of planning, knit together by a sense of strategic desperation, converged in 1941: the older, casual speculation on the susceptibility of Japan to aerial intimidation; the strategists’ rather sudden inter- est in the Philippines as a base for American action; and Roosevelt’s episodic but forceful attraction to air power.  Of these threads, only the role
