As Allied strategists meeting at Singapore agreed in April: “It is probable that her collapse will occur as a result of economic blockade, naval pressure and air bombardment.”74  The interest in aerial reinforcement of the Philippines came at first in fragmentary impulses held in check by military conservatism and the Europe-first priority. But suddenly those impulses came together in July, when renewed Japanese penetration southward (this time into the unoccupied areas of Indochina), plus Germany’s invasion of the Soviet Union (now agonizingly vulnerable to Japanese attack) provoked a sense of deepening crisis in the Far East. But crisis also presented opportunity. Germany’s turn east placed new demands on the American arsenal to aid Russia but also lowered by a notch the urgency of supplying the British. Moreover, MacArthur was exuberant about the chances of defending the Philippines, and Congress at last seemed ready to end starvation rations for the islands. Even the worst-case scenario—a Japanese strike north against the Soviet Union, widely predicted in the American press—offered compensations: relief of pressure on the European colonial outposts to the south and the alluring prospect of access to air bases in Russia’s Far Eastern territory, so close to Japanese cities. And the growing number and striking power of Amer- ica’s long-range bombers emboldened the architects of American policy.  Roosevelt, of course, was still intent on the use of economic sanctions to
