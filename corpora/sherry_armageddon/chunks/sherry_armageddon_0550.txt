anese plans for expansion.”3  Official doctrine continued to dismiss serious defense of the Philippines, but the ground beneath it shifted in a series of ad hoc initiatives in 1941. The impending shipment of modern aircraft to the islands elicited new hope from Douglas MacArthur and his air officers in the Philippines and from Marshall himself, who by February could comment: “If we had a single squadron of modern planes in the Philippines, it would at least give the Japanese something to think about.” Doubtless Marshall was then thinking only of a tactical role for his modern planes, but Air Corps officers were bolder. By April, their Intelligence Division was canvasing other government agencies for data on economic objectives in Japan suitable as targets for American bombers. In thé Philippines, Colonel Harold George initiated new plans for the defense of the islands and for air strikes against “Hainan, Formosa, and the main Japanese islands.” These developments paralleled the thinking of State Department hawks, who were “confident that the Japanese structure will collapse like the Italian one once a determined and prepared resistance is made,” and of the British who used the revealing Italian analogy more than the Americans, Churchill once calling the Japanese the “Wops of the Pacific.” What little strength the Allies had in the Far East was at least the kind “which Japan particularly fears,” air power.

But suddenly those impulses came together in July, when renewed Japanese penetration southward (this time into the unoccupied areas of Indochina), plus Germany’s invasion of the Soviet Union (now agonizingly vulnerable to Japane
