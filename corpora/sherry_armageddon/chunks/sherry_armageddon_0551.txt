came together in July, when renewed Japanese penetration southward (this time into the unoccupied areas of Indochina), plus Germany’s invasion of the Soviet Union (now agonizingly vulnerable to Japanese attack) provoked a sense of deepening crisis in the Far East. But crisis also presented opportunity. Germany’s turn east placed new demands on the American arsenal to aid Russia but also lowered by a notch the urgency of supplying the British. Moreover, MacArthur was exuberant about the chances of defending the Philippines, and Congress at last seemed ready to end starvation rations for the islands. Even the worst-case scenario—a Japanese strike north against the Soviet Union, widely predicted in the American press—offered compensations: relief of pressure on the European colonial outposts to the south and the alluring prospect of access to air bases in Russia’s Far Eastern territory, so close to Japanese cities. And the growing number and striking power of Amer- ica’s long-range bombers emboldened the architects of American policy.  Roosevelt, of course, was still intent on the use of economic sanctions to curb the Japanese. On July 26 he froze Japanese assets, a move that virtually halted Japanese trade in American goods, especially the petroleum products Japan so much needed. The relationship between that move and rearmament in the Philippines was unclear. Chronology alone suggests that the economic and military measures developed independently: the efforts of MacArthur and Marshall to deploy new air power to the Philippines and to return MacArthur to active duty as commander of American army forces in the Far East preceded news of Japan’s new move south, which prompted FDR's freeze order. Eager to delay war in the Far East, most military men, particularly in the navy, were critical of the embargo as provocative and probably saw it as simply heightening the probability of war and therefore the urgency of finding some way to deter it. Roosevelt might have regarded
