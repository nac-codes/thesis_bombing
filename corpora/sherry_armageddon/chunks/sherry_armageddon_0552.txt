, were critical of the embargo as provocative and probably saw it as simply heightening the probability of war and therefore the urgency of finding some way to deter it. Roosevelt might have regarded the economic and military measures as complementary deterrents or as forming a kind of carrot-and-stick approach to Tokyo, since his original intention had been to modulate the embargo so as to leave incentives for Japan to be cautious. More likely, there was no grand design here, not even in Roosevelt’s fertile mind, but simply parallel, ad hoc responses developed in competing bureaucracies and bound together only by the “careless hope”?5 that the Japanese would bow to superior force and American attention could remain where it belonged, on Europe.  If anything more guided Washington that summer, it was perhaps a model of undeclared war borrowed from the European theater and in one way or another Roosevelt’s guiding star since the fall of 1938. Washington worried less about a sudden, catastrophic Japanese attack on Allied and American installations (despite Japan's reputation for surprise) than about “gradual encroachment” against Russia and/or the Europeans’ colonial possessions.”6 If Japan moved in piecemeal fashion, the political problem would be acute, for Washington was hardly confident that an indirect challenge  to American interests would rally the American people to enter the Asian war. At the same time, the notion of gradual encroachment may have been wishful thinking, playing into Roosevelt’s preferred stratesv of limited war and allowing him to helieve there was time ta denlav limited forces ta the Far Fast while avnidings the full-scale hostilities that would camnromise aid tn Eurone As vet after  Page 102 of 368 24%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON return of Japanese forces from theatres vital to us.” They proposed using air power not precisely to deter war but at least to contain it cheaply so that the Anglo-Americans could kee
