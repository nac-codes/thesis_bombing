hic Japanese attack on Allied and American installations (despite Japan’s reputation for surprise) than about “gradual encroachment” against Russia and/or the Europeans’ colonial possessions.”¢ If Japan moved in piecemeal fashion, the political problem would be acute, for Washington was hardly confident that an indirect challenge to American interests would rally the American people to enter the Asian war. At the same time, the notion of gradual encroachment may have been wishful thinking, playing into Roosevelt’s preferred strategy of limited war and allowing him to believe there was time to deploy limited forces to the Far East while avoiding the full-scale hostilities that would compromise aid to Europe. As yet, after all, Roosevelt was successfully playing the game of undeclared war in the Atlantic; he did not relish the political prospects of urging full-scale use of American forces in either theater; and perhaps the Japanese themselves would be clever enough to calculate the disadvantages of provoking American entry into the war. If so, Americans would have time to build a bomber force in the Philippines and employ it in concert with other measures to force the Japanese back from an all-out confrontation with the United States. Once again, the bomber seemed less a weapon of war than a chip to play in an undeclared war of nerves.  The new mixture of urgency and opportunity brought forth action from high-level officials. By July 27, if not earlier, the Air Corps had begun work on ferrying B-17s to the Far East. In August, the War Department settled on a figure of 165 heavy bombers to be sent to the Philippines.” It was a bold decision. In face of the Europe-first priority, it seized most of the 220 B-17s scheduled for production over the next half-year and assigned half of all the big bombers the United States possessed to the Far East—all this when bombers were critically needed to guard the Atlantic sea-lanes,  Page 102 of 368 24%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POW
