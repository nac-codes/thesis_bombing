allel, ad hoc responses developed in competing bureaucracies and bound together only by the “careless hope”?5 that the Japanese would bow to superior force and American attention could remain where it belonged, on Europe.  If anything more guided Washington that summer, it was perhaps a model of undeclared war borrowed from the European theater and in one way or another Roosevelt’s guiding star since the fall of 1938. Washington worried less about a sudden, catastrophic Japanese attack on Allied and American installations (despite Japan’s reputation for surprise) than about “gradual encroachment” against Russia and/or the Europeans’ colonial possessions.”¢ If Japan moved in piecemeal fashion, the political problem would be acute, for Washington was hardly confident that an indirect challenge to American interests would rally the American people to enter the Asian war. At the same time, the notion of gradual encroachment may have been wishful thinking, playing into Roosevelt’s preferred strategy of limited war and allowing him to believe there was time to deploy limited forces to the Far East while avoiding the full-scale hostilities that would compromise aid to Europe. As yet, after all, Roosevelt was successfully playing the game of undeclared war in the Atlantic; he did not relish the political prospects of urging full-scale use of American forces in either theater; and perhaps the Japanese themselves would be clever enough to calculate the disadvantages of provoking American entry into the war.

By July 27, if not earlier, the Air Corps had begun work on ferrying B-17s to th
