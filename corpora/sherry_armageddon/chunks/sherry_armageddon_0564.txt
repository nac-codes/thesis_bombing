Europe-first priority, it seized most of the 220 B-17s scheduled for production over the next half-year and assigned half of all the big bombers the United States possessed to the Far East—all this when bombers were critically needed to guard the Atlantic sea-lanes, protect other outposts, train new crews, and bolster allies. The decision measured the desperation about the Far East and the optimism about the bomber’s potential that arose despite the formidable practical obstacles to deployment of the big bombers. Crews worked in utmost secrecy, prepared to fire at Japanese planes, forced to follow a circuitous path down through New Guinea and Australia to minimize detection by the Japanese, flying unfamiliar routes that taxed the endurance of the bomber, landing on unknown runways that sometimes collapsed under the weight of the Fortresses, and arriving in the Philippines to ground installations poorly equipped to handle them.78  Roosevelt’s role in this bold decision came late, if the surviving documents are a reliable guide. He apparently received his first briefing on the decision and gave it his approval during an August 7 meeting with Arnold and his military staff at the Argentia conference. The British, too, were apprised of the decision, impinging as it did on their long-frustrated hopes for American help in the Far East as well as on priorities for aid to England and the Soviet Union. No sustained discussion or controversy seemed to have ensued.?2  But back in Washington, the planned deployment was generating a crescendo of nervous optimism.

For years he had pondered how to place adequate American power in the Far East to contain the Japanese. He could hardly contain his joy about finding the solution, and it measured the enormous appeal of air power, particularly to civilians, that Stimson, this aging patriarch steeped in the ways of the ground army,
