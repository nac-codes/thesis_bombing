On September 12, the news that the first nine B-17s had arrived at Manila prompted Stimson to claim that the American bomber had “completely changed the strategy of the Pacific and lets American power back into the Islands in a way which it has not been able to do for twenty years.” He informed FDR and the cabinet that nothing less than a “reversal of the strategy of the world” had been brought by the arrival of the four- engine bomber. “The President was impressed,” noted Stimson, who was not past flattering himself about his own influence but in this case was probably correct.82  Following almost daily the progress of bomber flights to the Philippines, Stimson worked with Marshall to integrate the new air strategy with diplomacy and to fight off Roosevelt’s inclination to disperse American resources too thinly. When Roosevelt considered a reduction in the army’s size to facilitate increased aid abroad, Marshall prepared his case for exempting the Philippines from cuts: “Critical situation. Japan wavering.
