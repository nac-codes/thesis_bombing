d Halifax told Churchill, Roosevelt was already saying “a good deal... about the great effect that... planting some heavy bombers at the Philippines was expected to have upon the Japs.” On November 5, Roosevelt received from Marshall and Stark fresh assurances about the “potency” of the Philippines threat. On November 7, playing for time until the new threat was ready, Roosevelt rejected Churchill's plea for a verbal warning to Japan that might have only “an opposite effect” from deterrence and cabled the prime minister his cautious confidence that reinforcements at Singapore and the Philippines “will tend to increase Japan’s hesitation.” On the same day, Roosevelt polled his cabinet about “whether the people would back us up in case we struck at Japan down there.” Roosevelt’s phrasing, as Stimson recorded it, was vague, though significantly it included no explicit mention of Japanese attack on United States installations prior to American action. Stimson thought FDR had “the big bombers” in mind in his remarks, though among cabinet officers only he and Hull knew about them.83  Meanwhile, Stimson was trying to align the State Department with air strategy in order to make sure that his “imperfect threat” was not prematurely called. The problem was that even a small bomber force would not be ready until mid-December and a full force not until February or March.
