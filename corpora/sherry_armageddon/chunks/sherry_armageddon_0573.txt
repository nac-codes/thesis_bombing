th,” Roosevelt advised Churchill on October 15. As late as November 26 Marshall discounted attack on the Philippines “as a probability because the hazards would be too great for the Japanese.” Marshall also believed that a credible force would be in the Philippines by mid-December, though fewer than seventy heavy bombers would then be in place. Given that timetable, the United States might have ready the ul- timate deterrent to Japanese expansion: Fortresses and Liberators able to strike Japan itself.

It allowed the Americans and the British to move along parallel but independent tracks, as London was rushing naval reinforcements to the Far East, sharing with the Americans deterrence as their purpose and March 1942 as their deadline for building up their force. The parallel went further: in both cases the forces were too small and too hastily thrown together to be much more than a bluff, and
