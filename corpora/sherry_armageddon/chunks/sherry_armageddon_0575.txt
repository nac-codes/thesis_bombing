her case is it declared war,” Marshall reminded his staff, echoing Roosevelt’s views. Pending full-scale hostilities, MacArthur might carry out reconnaissance over Japanese-held territories, perhaps even over Japan itself. Believing that Japan might resort to further gradual encroachment, Marshall perhaps foresaw the bombers’ use in some sort of undeclared war in the Pacific.8¢  Here lay temptation to consider even more extravagant possibilities. If Tojo and Hull gave Marshall more time and if Tokyo launched only a limited offensive, Marshall could checkmate Japan in a bolder way. Military estimates in October still listed attack on Russia as the most probable Japanese action, with attack on American installations far down the list. “They are headed north,” Roosevelt advised Churchill on October 15. As late as November 26 Marshall discounted attack on the Philippines “as a probability because the hazards would be too great for the Japanese.” Marshall also believed that a credible force would be in the Philippines by mid-December, though fewer than seventy heavy bombers would then be in place. Given that timetable, the United States might have ready the ul- timate deterrent to Japanese expansion: Fortresses and Liberators able to strike Japan itself. The enemy would be trapped.82  So Marshall told an extraordinary gathering of press bureau chiefs and senior correspondents on the morning of Saturday, November 15. Swearing the reporters to secrecy, he asked them not to upset a delicate game of deterrence he outlined. “We are preparing an offensive war against Japan, whereas the Japs believe we are preparing only to defend the Phillipines /sic/.” The Japanese had not yet learned of the bomber buildup, he explained, adding (without mentioning American code-breaking efforts) that “we know what they know about us and they dont /sic/ know that we know it.” The moment was soon arriving to show America’s hand, but adroitly. Information about the buildup must not leak through
