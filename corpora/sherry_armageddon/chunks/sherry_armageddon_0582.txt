developing hopes for a capacity to bomb Japan itself.23 Staff planning documents at a variety of levels made frequent references to how Japan would “be open to aerial attack by U. S.” and its cities would be “a lucrative target for bombardment aviation.” Both economic and civilian targets were repeatedly identified. Granted, the full extent to which MacArthur and his staff had been briefed to undertake raids against Japan is unclear, and the whole effort had a quality of desperate improvisation.% But the ideas Marshall expressed on November 15, well documented also for the several weeks preceding and following it, were neither caprice nor simply bluff. As Marshall told an aide on November 1, “a strong stand meant nothing unless an actual action followed in case of necessity.”2>  Mystery about Marshall's intentions persists, however. For one thing, American bombers were not really up to the task envisioned for them. With a radius of action of about nine hundred miles when fully loaded, the B-17s near Manila could hardly reach the southernmost Ryukyus, much less the main Japanese cities, which lay some eighteen hundred miles from the bombers’ bases. One solution to this large dilemma was to send the longer-legged B-24s, with slightly greater range and higher ceiling, and to stage bomber attacks out of advance bases in northern Luzon or further north on smaller Philippine islands, though bases there would be highly vulnerable to Japanese attack.2©  Instead, as Marshall revealed on November 15, the War Department hit upon an even more fanciful scheme to solve the basing problem: bombers would shuttle between the Philippines and Soviet bases near Vladivostok or on the Kamchatka Peninsula; bases in China were also considered. After dropping bombs on Japan’s cities, the Luzon-based aircraft would have only a comparatively short flight to Siberian airfields, where they would refuel, reload, and return to their main bases after dropping more bombs on Japan on the way back.
