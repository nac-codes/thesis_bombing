t they nonetheless persisted in the shuttle-bombing scheme suggests that they foresaw no prolonged campaign against Japan requiring prodigies of logistics—a few surprise missions, even as Marshall suggested simply the threat of such missions, would overawe the Asians.  The political obstacles to the Siberian arrangement were even more daunting. The Soviet Union, already in a death struggle with Germany, hardly wanted to provoke war with Japan by allowing American use of Russian bases. Still, Japan might solve that problem simply by attacking the Soviet Union. In July, air strategists were already noting how Japan “would be impressed” if the B-17s being sent to the Far East followed a route through Siberia, then “along the edge of Japan,” and on to Manila, laying bare the vulnerability of “vital Japanese industrial establishments.” Tenuous, even devious negotiations with the Soviets ensued. Washington, already interested in an Alaska-Siberia route for ferrying Lend-Lease aircraft to the Russians, tried to exploit conversations over that possibility to gain information needed for basing bombers in Siberia. But Stalin told Harriman in September that American crews could not ferry aircraft through Siberia lest they jeopardize Soviet neutrality with Japan.22  The pattern of American failure was set but not easily admitted. Bombing Japan from Vladivostok “would be a comparatively simple matter,” Marshall was told in August. “The power” of an arrangement for shuttle-bombing “can hardly be over-estimated,” Stimson wrote FDR on October 21; indeed it seemed enough that “it might well remove Japan from the Axis powers.” Stimson took up the matter with Harriman on the same day and then sought Hull’s help in making arrangements with Moscow. Staff studies continued to emphasize the decisive potential of bombing from Soviet bases. The American effort foundered, however, on the declining probability that Japan would attack Russia, on Soviet secretiveness and suspiciousness, and on
