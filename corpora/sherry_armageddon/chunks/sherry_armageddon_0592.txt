proper moment. Both he and Stimson derived from American code-breaking an overconfidence that Japanese knowledge of the bomber buildup could be detected. Stimson was “very anxious to avoid any boasting” about the deployment, preferring to let “these facts sink into the Japanese of their own impact,” and he had prepared for Marshall the draft of an announcement about it “when the news breaks of the arrival of the flying fortresses at Manila.” As Marshall told an aide on November 1, after December 10 “it would be advantageous for the Japanese to learn of our really effective reinforcements.” Yet after his November 15 meeting with the press, any continuing efforts on Marshall’s part left behind a documentary trail of only teasing bits of information. He probably met with Roosevelt immediately after his morning conference with the press, but there the trail largely ends.102  One possibility is that the scheme aborted because of an unplanned leak. The flight of dozens of B-17s across the Pacific was a big secret to manage. The crisis in the Far East had already invited press speculation. Back in March, Joseph Alsop had discussed the “body blow” to Japan that would come from using B-17s based in China. On August 8 and again on October 31, U.S. News had speculated brazenly about possible American incendiary attacks delivered from American bases or from Vladivostok on Tokyo, that “city of rice-paper and wood houses.” If nothing else, such speculation illus- trated the ease with which some Americans contemplated bombing Japanese cities and their confidence that Japan would be an easier mark than Germany.101  The critical disclosure of American plans came on November 19 from the New York Times’s Arthur Krock. Krock revealed the reversal in American strategy regarding the Philippines and outlined how heavy bombers based there could launch a “pincer attack” and “drop bombs on Japan, land in Siberia, refuel, and rebomb and repeat the enterprise on a return trip to Manila.” What
