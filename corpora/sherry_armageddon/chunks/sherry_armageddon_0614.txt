the administration, from its own ranks as well as from allies and the press, to avoid any appearance of appeasement. Decoded Japanese messages indicated that some kind of Japanese action was now irre- versible, so that statements of diplomatic position could no longer serve to delay, only to mobilize opinion and fix Japanese culpability.1%  But confidence about the bomber may also have led the American government to overplay its hand, even at this late date. The situation in the Far East still seemed extraordinarily fluid. It was on the twenty-sixth that Marshall repeated his doubts that Japan would attack the Philippines. “Thus far we have talked in terms of the defense of the Philippines, but now the question is what we do beyond that,” he said hopefully. That was also the occasion for his remarks about undeclared war. The administration still saw merit in debating the wisdom of a warning to the Japanese emperor. Only on the twenty-eighth did Stimson resign himself to the doubtfulness of securing Siberian bases. Marshall still felt it possible on the seventeenth to plead to Roosevelt “to gain time.” Like other advisors, he listed possible Japanese objectives as a series of “ors”—Malaya or the Netherlands East Indies or the Burma Road or the Philippines, etc. Marshall’s expectations of a limited Japanese offen- sive fit neatly with FDR's prevailing belief, in Hopkins’s later words, that Japan “would merely use the ‘one by one’ technique of Germany” and avoid direct confrontation with the United States.1%  In short, the administration expected quick Japanese action but not all-out war.
