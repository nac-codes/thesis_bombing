The crucial element was not simply faith in American technology. Nor was it precisely faith in air power. It was faith in the idea of air power.

Like all myths, these derived in part from a factual basis: Japan’s profound difficulties in fighting the badly disorganized Chinese and her economic weaknesses. Those Japanese who typed Americans as shallow materialists unwilling to fight distorted the enemy as well. The point is not that Washington’s air stra
