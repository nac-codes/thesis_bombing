Several factors in wartime political culture guided acceptance and slowed realization. Initial uncertainties about the war's course, the purposes of political leadership, the stance of air power’s advocates, and the biases of prominent commentators—all these allowed concerned Americans to welcome the escalation of bombing and to ignore it, to celebrate its virtues and to overlook many of its consequences.
