staff. For all these reasons, debate on aerial operations among top strategists often lacked focus and clarity.  The point should not be pressed too far. Arnold could defer to Marshall in part because the chief of staff embraced at least a moderate version of air power. From the start, controversy arose when theater commanders demanded the bombers Arnold wanted reserved for independent strategic operations. Recurrently during the war, debate erupted over whether the British or the Americans had the better method for bombing. But widespread acceptance of bombing, the apparatus of decision making, and the nature of aerial operations rarely permitted those differences to be aired explicitly.  Of course, decisions of some sort had to be made. By January 1942 the Combined Chiefs of Staff had reconfirmed the Europe-first priority and authorized the buildup of an American bomber force in Britain in 1942. But the size and mission of what became the American Eighth Air Force constantly shifted through the year. The Allies initially considered invading France as early as the autumn of 1942, an operation that would shift the function of the bombers from strategic devastation to support of ground forces. Those prospects faded in the summer of 1942, but TORCH (the North Africa invasion) again siphoned off many of the bombers from General Ira Eaker’s Eighth Bomber Command. American heavy bombers first struck occupied Europe in the summer of 1942—raiding Ploesti from Egyptian bases on June 12 and targets in France from English bases on August 17. At that, the bombers were rushed into battle prematurely in order to present Allies and Americans a show of American contribution to the European war as well as to lay claim in the headlines for the AAF’s vision of its role. Not until the next year—much later and in far smaller numbers than Arnold had once hoped—could American bombers penetrate German air space. American strategic bombing, then, was at once a high priority and a distant
