Roosevelt rarely spoke of the bomber as an instrument of vengeance against the enemy. In alleging Nazi responsibility for beginning air war on cities, he stated that “the Nazis and the Fascists have asked for it—and they are going to get it.” But like his desire “to eliminate from the human race Nations like Germany and Japan,” this was a deviation from his usual characterization of the war's purpose in positive terms of reconstituting the defeated enemies as peace-loving nations and securing a permanent peace.

For his part, Hopkins was a sympathetic recipient of that message, deriving “thrill and encouragement” from
