who found “poetic justice” in aerial assault on Germany and Japan, found the rhetoric of revenge more congenial.12  By word, then, Roosevelt offered Americans little inducement to anticipate or desire the savagery of all-out air war. But in shaping expectations, presidents have much more than words at their disposal. Roosevelt’s actions often spoke more loudly. The priority he attached to bomber production did so. Even more so did the famous raid on Japanese cities carried out on April 18, 1942, by sixteen army B-25 bombers flying from the carrier Hornet. That mission arose from the numerous schemes proposed before and after Pearl Harbor for bombing Japan and from Roosevelt’s desire to strike a blow at Japanese morale, at the frustrations and fears of the American public, and at the wavering Chinese commitment to carry on their war. Air officers, too, hoped that air raids would force the Japanese to withdraw fighter aircraft from combat theaters, provide “a shot-in-the-arm for Generalissimo Chiang,” and satisfy public opinion in the states, where “the bonus clubs have been putting up prize money for the first air attack upon Japan.” At the State Department, the principal Far East official believed that an aerial blow on Tokyo would demoralize the Japanese and sap their confidence in the emperor.13  The raid’s results were more mixed than American officials and a jubilant press acknowledged. General James Doolittle’s bombers carried out low-level bombing runs with incendiaries and high explosives, but in flying on to Chinese bases, the planes were all lost when forced to land in Japanese-held territory (or, in one case, Siberia). As Arnold wrote to the president, “No raid is a success in which losses exceed ten per cent.” Roosevelt described the raid as an attack on Japanese “war industries.” In fact, the Doolittle raiders were supposed to attack by night, when the precision suggested by FDR's phrase would have been impossible; only the apprehension that the Hornet
