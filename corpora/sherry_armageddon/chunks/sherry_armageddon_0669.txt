stylized or romanticized ways that rarely suggested the scope and nature of the destruction bombers might deliver and pictured airplanes more often in tactical than in strategic missions. The Boeing Company took the high road in its ads, among the finest technically and the most restrained of the war. In doing so, however, it struck another common note in wartime advertising. Wary of inflammatory language, Boeing emphasized the company’s technical achievements, both in its copy and in its high-quality photographs of soaring bombers and sophisticated production lines. Even when Boeing depicted combat, as it did with the Eighth Air Force’s great Schweinfurt raids, it eschewed stylized depiction. Emphasizing accuracy and realism, it ran an official AAF photograph of the bombed target (though clouds prevented the viewer from seeing tangible destruction), while the copy stressed that its bombers destroyed factories without harming cities.  Like the president, most wartime advertising asked the viewer to see the war as a production and engineering effort and to celebrate American superiority in that regard. That approach satisfied the long-run corporate goal of winning the allegiance of customers in the postwar market. Of course, companies identified their prowess with the destruction carried out by Allied forces, but except for those firms looking to defense production as their primary postwar activity, destruction was a transitory expression of that prowess. Their long-term interest lay in playing up those technical abilities with lasting implications for the civilian market. In short, they celebrated the means of production as much as, even more than, its immediate ends. And by 1944, as the end of the war became foresee- able—and the bombing intensified—the lure of postwar markets shifted advertising further from the realities of the war.  Particularly among the airline and airplane companies eager to promote civilian air travel after the war, wartime advertising also
