Mitchell’s predictions on how Pearl Harbor could be attacked added another sensational dimension to his alleged martyrdom. Even to establishment commentators like the Times’s Arthur Krock, it was now obvious that “General Mitchell was always right,” the victim of what William Bradford Huie called “the same old gold-braided bunk” still controlling the armed services.

Their enemies were the Joint Chiefs, indulged by Roosevelt and backed by a vast bureaucracy committed to sending battleships and infantrymen off to pointless slaughter. Of course, in these accounts, strategy and politics were intertwined.
