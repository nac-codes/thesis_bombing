They sometimes presented an almost effortless path to victory. In William Bradford Huie’s view, American bombers could strike Berlin or Tokyo “with city-block accuracy without a bombardier’s ever seeing anything on the ground,” seeking “not to destroy every building in the block; but to destroy the one building in the block where bearings for the Focke-Wulf planes are being made.” Victory would require little fighting on the ground. In The Coming Battle of Germany (1942), William Ziff thought an invasion of Europe not only unnecessary but impossible. Inasmuch as Americans were avengers, not conquerors like the Germans, they should happily settle for the destruction of Germany by air, though perhaps they would not have to carry it out, for “at the first sign of real disaster the neuroticism, the inner turmoil, the wild fears and hatreds of these people, will boil to the surface.” In a typical argument, Ziff urged Americans to avoid “a war of attrition” with the “rivers of blood” that would flow in a conventional war, without acknowledging the destructiveness of a war of aerial attrition in which even the Allies, he predicted, would lose twenty-five hundred planes per month.22  The prophets were in fact increasingly pressed to bridge the gulf between prewar myth and wartime reality. Old metaphors of easy victory persisted in promises that “a knockout blow against these [enemy] citadels must bring inevitable collapse, just as a house of cards collapses when the base cards are removed.” But the same writer warned that such a blow would be “an undertaking of the greatest magnitude.” requiring thousands of bombers
