, yet maintained that the objectives of bombing should be economic. In short, writers like Michie were tracing for their readers the shift in bombing methods from selective paralysis to sustained destruction, while struggling to minimize the moral and military questions such a shift raised.24  It was de Seversky, the colorful Russian-American aviator and manufacturer, who most grandly revealed and brutally resolved the tensions in thinking about air power building for a generation.
