it is neither using all our power, nor is it absorbing the enemy’s reserve strength in all categories.” To idle Allied armies and navies seemed foolish, for “the most humane way to fight a war is to prosecute it with the utmost fury until victory is won; this will always cost less in lives.” These propositions were deeply grounded in sound doctrine and military tradition but offered only utilitarian arguments against an air strategy. And because Eliot and Baldwin viewed war as the application of rational calculations on the most efficient means of victory, they could not appreciate air power’s attraction as a weapon of vengeance.28  War had attenuated the spectrum of debate on air power. Where once alternatives (however arbitrary) had been offered in the clash between prophets and skeptics, now public argument was largely confined to disagreement over the techniques and proportions of the air war. Even the prophets sometimes backed away from their more extreme claims for air power as the sole instrument of victory.*2 In short, Americans were given no alternative to substantial reliance on widespread destruction by air as one method to win the war. Strategic as well as moral debate had not ceased, but it ran in narrow channels. This, more than specific claims and counterclaims, defined how Americans thought about what bombers might do.  Reaction to de Seversky’s book indicated this trend. While technicians took issue with the soundness of his predictions and some of the religious press criticized their moral implications, a more common note was generous approval. Here was a book of “tremendous charm” and “surgeon-like reasoning.” De Seversky was ranked with Mitchell, Admiral Mahan, and Clausewitz as strategist and contributor to the “philosophy of conflict” (a judgment that has not stood the test of time). He was, like Mitchell, cast as a lonely hero battling the “stubborn wall of opposition” erected by the bureaucracy of the War Department and the Air Corps. Such a
