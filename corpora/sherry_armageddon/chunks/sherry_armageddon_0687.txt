hat has not stood the test of time). He was, like Mitchell, cast as a lonely hero battling the “stubborn wall of opposition” erected by the bureaucracy of the War Department and the Air Corps. Such a view not only overlooked de Seversky’s own vested interest as aircraft manufacturer but made it appear that the AAF—whose leadership a Nation reviewer equated to “the management of a peanut wagon”—was far too reactionary to bomb with the zeal de Seversky proposed. As it had for two decades, the alleged conservatism of government officials obscured official embrace of strategic bombing.

In short, writers like Michie were tracing for their readers the shift in bombing methods from selective paralysis to sustained destruction, while struggling to minimize the moral and military questions such a shift raised.24  It was de Seversky, the colorful Russian-American aviator and manufacturer, who most grandly revealed and brutally resolved the tensions in thinking about air power building for a generation. In the tradition of futurist writing like that of his mentor Mitchell, de Seversky couched
