Working these old political accusations, many reviewers said little about the destruction de Seversky proposed.22  Approval and adroit promotion gave de Seversky’s ideas broad and sustained exposure. Condensed in Readers Digest, the book was purchased in 1942 for movie production by Walt Disney. An odd but fruitful partnership between prophet and animator ensued. It was a commercially risky film, so Disney worked closely with the Gallup organization, whose market research was designed not only to promote the film but, by divining public interests and tastes, to help shape its content.3!
