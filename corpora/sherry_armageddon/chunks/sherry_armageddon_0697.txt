True to Hollywood’s conventions, “it often seemed that the Army Air Corps Chorus was hovering around every corner” and the product was “pure sentimentalized corn.” The latter was most evident in A Guy Named Joe, in which Spencer Tracy, killed in a suicidal attack on a German aircraft carrier, returns to earth as counselor to green airmen.

As with the book, the formal argument was for a sure and relatively easy method of victory, but vengeance was the very patriotic theme. Reduced to animation, air war was at once glorified, trivialized, and dehumanized, becoming “a carnival of destruction, relieved of all such
