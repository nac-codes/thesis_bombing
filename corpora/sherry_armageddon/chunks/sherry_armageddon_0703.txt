orating closely with the AAF, glorified the air force, its men, and its bombers. True to Hollywood’s conventions, “it often seemed that the Army Air Corps Chorus was hovering around every corner” and the product was “pure sentimentalized corn.” The latter was most evident in A Guy Named Joe, in which Spencer Tracy, killed in a suicidal attack on a German aircraft carrier, returns to earth as counselor to green airmen.  A few of Hollywood's better films, however, downplayed the sentimental and, like Victory Through Air Power, cultivated popular expectations for a virtuous campaign of annihilation against Japan. Assisted by Hap Arnold and William Faulkner, Howard Hawks employed a style of gritty realism in Air Force (1943), the story of a B-17 crew who arrive at Oahu amid the Japanese attack and fly on to the Philippines to help American forces there. He also reassured Americans about their virtues in an age of technological warfare: the crewmen were not bloodthirsty patriots, but efficient technicians moved by personal loss and indignation over Japanese treachery, and the unfounded portrayal of Japanese fifth columnists in Hawaii (which prompted an eloquent protest from Norman Thomas) set up the bomber as an instrument of righteous indignation. In fact, the B-17 Mary Ann was the star of the film: if initially perceived as a “mechanized freight train” flown by a “mechanical brain,” Mary Ann emerged as a battle-scarred heroine endowed with her own indomitable spirit and in whom the crew invested its loyalty. Most important, Mary Ann finally finds her true purpose: her first mission (intercepting Japanese ships approaching the Philippines) fit the classic defensive rationale for the bomber, but as the film ends the bomber departs to attack Tokyo, in a visual promise that Americans’ wish for Japan’s annihilation will be fulfilled. A later film—The Purple Heart (1944), about the torture and trial of the Doolittle aviators who fell into Japanese hands—gave explicit express
