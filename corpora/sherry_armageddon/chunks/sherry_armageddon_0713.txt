n who “gave the impression that any American could lick any twenty Japs” and on home front affluence and illusions of ease—the mood of a nation “wallowing in unprecedented pros- perity,” as he bitterly put it.37  Yet the savagery Sherrod described may have cut an unintended way. Presented as the grim necessity Americans had to accept, that savagery also made any alternative to a war of mutual “extermination” seem attractive. As the young John F. Kennedy wrote his parents shortly before Tarawa: “When I read that we will fight the Japs for years if necessary and will sacrifice hundreds and thousands if we must—I always like to check from where he is talking—it’s seldom out here.” Kennedy hoped that “perhaps all of that won't be necessary—and it can all be done by bombing.”38  The best reporters, like Sherrod, usually viewed the air war from the perspective, literal and strategic, of the ground soldiers. Few journalists of equivalent talent covered the strategic bombing effort. Many accounts of action in the air continued the romantic tradition of glorifying individual efforts and sacrifices, particularly early in the war, with the Eagle Squadron of American fliers serving in the RAF, Doolittle’s raiders, and Chennault’s Flying Tigers. In part because early action was small-scale, the old gladiators-of-the-sky tradition persisted. True, particularly in the Pacific war, the enemy supposedly lacked the chivalric qualities attributed to him in the First World War. Robert Scott, Jr.’s God Is My Co-Pilot, in which God hardly appeared, mixed racial hatred with a cheerful zest for air combat: “Personally, every time I cut Japanese columns to pieces in Burma, strafed Japs swimming from boats we were sinking, or blew a Jap pilot to hell out of the sky, I just laughed in my heart and knew that I had stepped on another black-widow spider or scorpion.” Scott recorded brutalities by Americans that he condemned when carried out by the enemy, and likewise recklessness by Ameri- cans
