Crewmen supposedly sprang from the frontier tradition of the “Kentucky hunter and the Western Indian-fighter.” Exchanging rifle for turret, “the American boy simply changes the nature of his game. Instead of raiding Sioux or Apache, instead of buffalo or antelope, he lays his sights on Zero or Heinkel, on Stuka or Messerschmitt.” But frontier individualists often abandoned the team and fled organized society.
