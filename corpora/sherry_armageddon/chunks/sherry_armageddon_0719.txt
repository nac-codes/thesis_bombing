purpose to the dustbowl refugees of The Grapes of Wrath.42  Steinbeck acknowledged that the pilot as individualist hero was gone, but he tried to sustain the American attachment to individualism in the new cooperative setting. On the one hand, he emphasized the modernity of the airman, who has no “ecstatic anticipation of Valhalla, honor, and glory, but . . . fights to win and to survive.” This “isn’t a war of speeches and frothy hatred. It is a technical job, a surgeon’s job. There is only time for hatred among civilians. Hatred does not operate a bombsight.” In some ways Steinbeck’s airman was the prototype of the “organization man” widely seen after the war as the dominant character type of American culture: the bomber crewman recognized the superiority of the group to the individual; the bomber team “is truly a democratic organization” which banished arbitrary, paternal authority; the good crewman internalized organizational values, for he “shall know the reasons for orders rather than . . . obey blindly and perhaps stupidly.” The airman was cool, cooperative, controlled. On the other hand, by invoking the concept of the team, Steinbeck also grounded the character and values of his airmen in familiar virtues and institutions. Bombs Away fairly dripped sports analogies: the air crew was “the greatest team in the world,” and the airmen’s war “the Big League in the toughest game we have ever been up against, with the pennant the survival and the future of the whole nation.” Far from being a wrenching change, service in the air force harnessed skills and attitudes learned on boyhood baseball teams and hunting trips and in encounters with the family car.42  Steinbeck’s outpouring of images and analogies betrayed tensions in his effort to reconcile past and present. Crewmen supposedly sprang from the frontier tradition of the “Kentucky hunter and the Western Indian-fighter.” Exchanging rifle for turret, “the American boy simply changes the nature of his game.
