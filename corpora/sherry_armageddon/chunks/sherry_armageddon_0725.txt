quail hunter and pony express rider was surely comforting, capturing what Americans wanted to see in themselves, and in soldiers and sailors as well as airmen. But it was also mislead- ing because it did not suggest what these Americans would have to do, and become, in war.  Steinbeck updated a tradition of looking at new weapons. Like his predecessors (if with fewer of their doubts), he pushed away terror by finding that new technologies liberated old virtues and gave rise to new ones. Like them, he considered how new devices shaped men’s characters, not how character contributed to new devices and their destructive uses. Later, after the war, Steinbeck granted that he had crossed the line between journalism and advocacy. “We were all part of the war effort,” he wrote. Correspondents were not “liars.” But, he added, “it is in the things not mentioned that the untruth lies.” In Bombs Away, many things were not mentioned.4®  Especially neglected were the destructive nature and intent of bombing. “For a long time we hated the idea of the heavy bomber. It was considered only an offensive weapon designed to carry bomb loads to enemy cities to destroy them.” But the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway “have demonstrated that our heavy bomber is our greatest weapon for the defense of our coast against invasion,” Steinbeck argued, unaware of how poorly the land-based bombers had performed at Midway. Steinbeck admitted that enemy countries, not just ships at sea, would be bombed. But airmen “knew the mathematics of destruction. Guns and ammunition and food that does not arrive is more important than a bomb dropped in the Wilhelmstrasse.” It still appeared, as it had before Pearl Har- bor, that in the free market of the bomber’s uses, good ones would drive out pointlessly destructive ones.47  A later sketch of the airman by Brendan Gill, one of the talented writers at the New Yorker during the war, succeeded where Steinbeck failed, in part because the accumulation of experi
