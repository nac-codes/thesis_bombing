s, he discovered in England “that there were people in the world who looked the same as us but thought differently from us,” and he “began to wonder if the Germans were maybe as much different from the English and us as a lot of writers and politicians claimed.” He did not directly question what he did. But he noted that pilots seemed eager to fly again, perhaps “because they’re really flying the ship. When you're only one of the hired hands, who’s being carried along to do the dirty work, to drop the bombs and do the killing, you don’t feel so good about it.” In the end, feeling “cheated out of a good big chunk of our lives,” Hallock divined no special meaning in what he had done, only hoping that eventually he would feel that “all that cannonfodder stuff never happened.”48  This bittersweet portrait fleshed out the flier far more than Steinbeck had done. Where Steinbeck’s men had been temporarily adrift but deeply rooted in American traditions, Hallock had an uncertain place in his own culture, whose dominant quality was its quiet regimentation of powerless men. Technology informed the lives of both Steinbeck’s men and Hallock, but where Steinbeck saw an effortless fit between man and machine, Hallock felt an alien presence. In 1944, another observer, the historian Dixon Wecter, in “Children of the Machine Age,” found fliers to be men with “little interest in the life of ideas or social values,” men who “emotionally are often immature. ... They are types of modern man, whose command of technology is vastly superior to the control of his own group plans and destinies.”42 Hallock did search for ideas and values, but like Wecter’s veterans, he was captive of the machine and adrift.  Writers like Gill and Wecter raised at least oblique doubts about the values informing the bombing effort and the costs exacted from the men involved, although by the time such writing appeared in 1944 “the bloom was off the war books,” as Sherrod later put it.°° Readers of Life were led
