power offered the promise of easy victory and vengeance against their enemies. Yet most Americans, like their leaders, deferred final judgment on that promise, preferring to set aside the wrangling about theory and just give air power its chance. Insofar as Americans sought vengeance, they usually let it emerge as a consequence of policies whose stated purpose was the destruction of economic and military objectives, or let British night bombers provide it. Japan’s punishment was more avidly and openly welcomed, and words were often strident, but Japan would not come within reach of American air power until the war’s last year, except for Doolittle’s promissory note on things to come. Above all, Americans preferred to view the bombing effort in the categories—production and technology—that reflected their virtues and avoided explicit questions about moral and military purposes. The media demonstrated some awareness of the nature of bombing operations late in the war, but then to help Americans appreciate and sustain the costs of war, not to raise fundamental questions about its content.  Perhaps the acceptance of strategic air war meant that Americans had suspended moral debate, accepted the bomber on utilitarian grounds, and revealed again their supposed “tendency to refer to war in absolute terms.”55 But while the religious and pacifist press sometimes displayed that tendency, its stance and role in wartime debate also revealed more complex reasons for the accept- ance of air war.  Implicitly or explicitly, it is true, the religious press often confessed its inability to advocate restraints on the conduct of air war. Reacting to the Doolittle raid, the Christian Century could only express regret about the intensification of air war and “commit to the mercy of God those upon whom the bombs may fall.” One source of restraint, arising out of prewar law and theology, lay in the test of utility, the principle that “greater violence must not be used than is necessary to
