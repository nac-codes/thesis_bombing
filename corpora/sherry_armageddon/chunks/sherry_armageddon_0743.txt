upon whom the bombs may fall.” One source of restraint, arising out of prewar law and theology, lay in the test of utility, the principle that “greater violence must not be used than is necessary to achieve the purpose in view.” But there seemed no way “to draw a line between discriminate and indiscriminate bombing.” Indeed, it seemed “idle to try to put a check upon the way in which weapons are used. If we fight at all, we fight all out.” More than that, the Christian Century assumed that bombing did have military utility. That left the religious press no alternative except to do what Commonweal did: condemn the bombing of cities as “indefensible morally, no matter how efficacious militarily.” Such condemnation set a high moral standard but was consigned to practical irrelevancy because few Americans would sacrifice a weapon whose utility even Commonweal felt forced to acknowledge. That acknowledgment was perhaps the most telling component of the dissenters’ position. With surprising ease, they relinquished the argument that might most effectively have rooted moral concerns in practical conduct of the war—the possibility that much bombing served little military purpose.5®  It was addressed, however, by the English pacifist Vera Brittain in Massacre by Bombing, a tract published in the United States early in 1944 and given front-page coverage by the New York Times. By arguing that bombing could be justified only if there was “absolute certainty” that it would shorten the war, Brittain admitted that bombing might have its place. But she argued that the bombing of German cities had failed to offer convincing evidence in that regard and in the meantime had caused untold suffering. In the past, laws of war at least “bore witness to the survival of some fragments of a Christian conscience among the combatants.” But in World War II, “the contesting parties pay little heed to the former decencies and chivalries.” Brittain was trying to establish standards by which the bru
