even Commonweal felt forced to acknowledge. That acknowledgment was perhaps the most telling component of the dissenters’ position. With surprising ease, they relinquished the argument that might most effectively have rooted moral concerns in practical conduct of the war—the possibility that much bombing served little military purpose.5®  It was addressed, however, by the English pacifist Vera Brittain in Massacre by Bombing, a tract published in the United States early in 1944 and given front-page coverage by the New York Times. By arguing that bombing could be justified only if there was “absolute certainty” that it would shorten the war, Brittain admitted that bombing might have its place. But she argued that the bombing of German cities had failed to offer convincing evidence in that regard and in the meantime had caused untold suffering. In the past, laws of war at least “bore witness to the survival of some fragments of a Christian conscience among the combatants.” But in World War II, “the contesting parties pay little heed to the former decencies and chivalries.” Brittain was trying to establish standards by which the brutalities of bombing could at least be measured, even if not stopped. Her target was conscience as much as deeds.  In that effort she succeeded to some degree, in part by flushing out the mood of vengeance usually shrouded by utilitarian arguments for bombing. The writer MacKinlay Kantor justified “socking the rapacious German nation with every pound of high explosive available” as necessary for punishing aggression and deterring its recurrence, while other responses spoke of bombing as justified repayment for Nazi crimes. Here indeed was evidence that bombing satisfied more than just hopes for victory. (Just before the controversy arose over Brittain’s declaration, a statement on the bombing of Monte Cassino by General Dwight Eisenhower was released warning that the same problem could arise on the battlefield, for “the phrase ‘military nece
