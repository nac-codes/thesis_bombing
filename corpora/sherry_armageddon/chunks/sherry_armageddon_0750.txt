not a fundamental right to be abridged only in extremis.52  Of course that argument was no novelty by World War II. Invoked to justify siege, blockade, and submarine warfare, it was also not novel to aerial warfare. It drew its moral force from an all-too- real historical development, the rapacious demands made by modern states on their entire populations in the pursuit of victory, and it was a difficult argument to refute. But as usually invoked, it was a repugnant argument, although a moral one of sorts. It ignored any distinction between civilians who were willing workers and others who were conscripts of the state. It placidly assumed that their killing would measurably advance the cause of victory. It fatally undercut the moral indignation that Americans earlier had expressed over Japanese bombing in China and German bombing in Europe.  Perhaps because that argument was repugnant, some Americans resorted to another, slipperier defense of bombing: that civilian deaths were acceptable as the accidental by-product of the destruction of legitimate targets. That is, lack of the intention to harm absolved the destroyer of moral responsibility. Persistent in both British and American circles, this argument took on the quality of ritual denial inasmuch as civilian deaths could be incurred as long as they were not openly desired. More forth-right was de Seversky’s bland explanation of how rationalization could operate: “the  Vt a et 2 a tat et 2 at a tt de a Le at 2 ed ee tt et et tt  Page 138 of 368 32%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  Se ee ee ee ee ee eS I fe a Rca  Between the celebration of revenge by Kantor and the suspicions of overkill by McCormick stood a more commonplace reaction to the bombing, the kind of bland denial demonstrated by the New Republic. The liberal weekly deplored “bombing defenseless people merely to instil terror in them” but implied there were no defenseless people in modern war, and besides, “so far as we are a
