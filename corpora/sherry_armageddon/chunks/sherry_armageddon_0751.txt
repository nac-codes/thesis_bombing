the New Republic. The liberal weekly deplored “bombing defenseless people merely to instil terror in them” but implied there were no defenseless people in modern war, and besides, “so far as we are aware,” terror bombing “is not the practice of the RAF and the AAF.” The truth was that most of the liberal press was too concerned for the political outcome of the war to have much interest in its military conduct. Dissent from the course of bombing was confined to the fringes of American politics, and even there few mounted an effective case that bombing ran beyond the requirements of victory. That so few did—that even dissenters usually accepted the military utility of bbmbing—measured again, from still another perspective, the persuasiveness of the air power argument.5”  Still, the brief controversy over Brittain’s tract, even the hair-trigger reactions of those who condemned her outright, suggested that moral debate was not suspended. Even total war did not erase all moral sensibilities about bombing. That was the case in Great Britain, where direct knowledge of bombing’s horrors induced some doubts about the wisdom and legitimacy of all-out air war.58 In the United States, too, exposed as it had been for a generation to horrific as well as benign literature about the bomber, moral argument was not entirely discarded. To be sure, it was often crude. Yet even retribution was, to its proponents, a moral as well as political imperative. A corollary to retribution was the claim that “war is a conflict of peoples, not of armies.” In the words of a contributor to the New Republic, “The natural enemy of every American man, woman and child is the Japanese man, woman and child.” The nation might spare the civilian if the enemy could be defeated without harming him, but if not, “he reverts to his fundamental position as ... prime target.” Thus, “unnecessary destruction is not unnecessary when it becomes necessary”—necessary to win, that is.
