ed much popular attention, and in which journalists and politicians were ill-equipped or disinclined to raise moral issues. To those who sought vengeance, bombing offered it without much need to proclaim it. To those who sought a narrower justification for air power, seeing its morality as inhering in its utility, measuring that utility was critical for maintaining limits on destruction. But utility was an imponderable: the gains of air war were rarely quantifiable in terms of acreage conquered or armies surrendered, and they were inseparable from progress made in other ways, such as invasions assisted and armies immobilized. Even after the war, gains resisted precise characterization. During the war, their intangible na- ture confused and perhaps exhausted intelligent debate on the morality and efficacy of bombing.  These circumstances were more permissive than determinative, for where they differed somewhat, as in England, debate was at best modestly more informed. But they were strengthened by broader characteristics of the war. Argument about bombing was crude because categories of argument about the war itself were crude. What Americans learned of the war usually shielded them from addressing its consequences in human terms. Various forms of a moral argument were advanced but sometimes as sops to troubled consciences or to the needs of public relations, and never did argument rise to the level of sustained debate. It hardly seemed that it could, given the imponderables at issue, and a more general sense of futility or indifference about any possibility of arresting the ferocity of the war.  But casual attitudes toward bombing did not arise solely from the circumstances of the war. The distance from which Americans viewed air war, as either prospect or reality, had always been great. The capacity of the bomber to secure easy vengeance in the guise of military necessity had long been one of its attractions. Its promise to reduce or end bloodletting on the ground
