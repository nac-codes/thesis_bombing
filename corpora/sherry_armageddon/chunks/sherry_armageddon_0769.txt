been hypocritical for a Truman or an Eisenhower to dis- honor an Arnold, Eaker, or LeMay for actions so broadly sanctioned. But if they had, a different course of history might have resulted.s5  It might have in another, even more far-reaching way. What moral debate that did occur about bombing focused on the near-term danger of harm to the enemy. Almost invisible was the danger it posed to those who triumphantly unleashed it. Briefly, it caught the eye of the New Yorker: “Once again, in their collective reaction to the destruction of Berlin, New Yorkers have demonstrated that they don’t know what fear is.” The magazine agreed with other commentary arguing that “it serves the bastards right... that it was a necessary action, efficiently and economically carried out... that each individual should shoulder his share of the moral responsibility for it.” But the New Yorker added ominously:  One implication, however, is still, as far as we know, fluttering around untrapped. Nobody has pointed out that the destruction of Berlin established the fact that it is now possible to destroy a city and that every city, but for the hairline distinction between the potential and the actual, is afire, its landmarks gone and its population homeless.

With the invasion of Europe imminent, 1944 opened with widespread “anticipation of vast American losses.”®2 Insofar as
