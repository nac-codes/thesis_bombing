ericans during World War II; indeed, their own Civil War offered much the same lesson. Given how much Americans had World War I in mind as they waged the second war, their insensitivity to that lesson is striking.  The dominant image of air power, as a revolutionary weapon that broke from the past, discouraged careful attention to these depressing precedents from past wars. The parallels between the two world wars did not seem close enough: futile infantry charges consumed a nation’s own population as well as its enemy’s, while massive bombing raids, unless they provoked a response in kind, killed the enemy far more than one’s own. So the defenders of air power argued, although the reality was more complicated. It was not just Anglo-American air power that saved the lives of many British and American soldiers. “The truth is that in every war somebody has to deal with the enemy’s main body; in the Second World War it was the Russians.”® Usually overlooking that truth, both critics and proponents of air power failed to probe more subtly the lessons of World War I.  Restraining wartime practice, more skeptical attitudes might also have made a longer-term difference, leading Americans to view themselves, their victory, their war, and their weapons more modestly. Some Americans, including many in generals’ uniforms, did view the bombing as at best a dirty if necessary business. Had more done so, the tendency of Americans to see their role in the war self-righteously might have diminished, and along with it that sense of virtue that Americans carried into the postwar world. It would have been harder to equate technological superiority with moral superiority and take the latter “to be a permanent quality which not only explains past victories, but also justifies the national claim to be the lawgiver and arbiter of mankind,” as Hans Morgenthau complained in 1950. Likewise, the air force’s shining image and dominance in strategy during the postwar years would have been more
