In light of those illusions, it is clear that professional officers had difficulty viewing the air war any more realistically than did the general public. For a variety of reasons, including the role of strategic realities and perceptions, they too maintained a distance on the air war, especially when that war intensified in 1944. Certainly intelligent men tried to formulate intelligent plans.

Its participation there was at best reluctant, retarding as it did the buildup of the Eighth Air For
