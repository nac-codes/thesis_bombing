North African theater, for example, where the Army Air Forces gained much of its first experience. Its participation there was at best reluctant, retarding as it did the buildup of the Eighth Air Force in England and confined as it was largely to support of surface forces moving against the Germans and Italians. Most bombing done by Allied air forces in North Africa was hardly strategic. Yet there were compensations. For Arnold, even a North African campaign was preferable to the diversion of bombers to the Pacific—the navy’s desire—inasmuch as it carried the promise of further bases from which to carry out strategic attacks on Italy and Germany. The same promise allowed Arnold to swallow another distasteful decision, to follow up TORCH with operations against Sicily and Italy. And if still subordinated to a sea—land offensive, AAF commanders, supported by Eisen- hower, nonetheless gained independence and unity of command in tactical matters.  But the AAF’s success in Africa as a cooperative arm could also backfire, since it provided support for those arguing that the cooperative role should be dominant. At best, TORCH’s impact on the air force’s strategic fortunes was double-edged, depleting Eaker’s Eighth Air Force but allowing it time to mount an independent campaign by delaying the invasion of northwestern Europe. But through the autumn of 1942, the new time-lease was used to little avail. True, bombing accuracy was encouraging, despite wild misses like the time bombers struck a French town one hundred miles away from their target. Likewise, the bombers seemed to take an encouraging toll of enemy fighters, so much so that even British newsmen and officers muted their earlier skepticism about American bombing methods. They joined American air force leaders in the mistaken belief that the Luftwaffe was on the wane and the chance for decisive air attack on Germany was near, if only they could stop those diversions.  But the toll of enemy fighters soon shriveled wh
