h about putting a subordinate on the line, Arnold rushed Eaker from England to defend daylight strategic operations. Eaker personally took his case to Churchill, assembling the arguments for the daylight bomber, principally the economy of force achievable through greater precision. Eaker’s position was tricky, for he had little new to say to the British, and he had to defend the Eighth Air Force without appearing to derogate the RAF’s contribution. As before, the best tack was to deny conflict: British and American operations would be complementary, not competitive, the British destroying urban areas, the Americans hitting bottleneck targets or  Location 3881 of 12433 34%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON helpless to resist or incapable of comprehending.  1942-43: THE PERILS OF DISPERSION  One reason they diverged was that forces were scattered in ways that strategists had not foreseen—to the North African theater, for example, where the Army Air Forces gained much of its first experience. Its participation there was at best reluctant, retarding as it did the buildup of the Eighth Air Force in England and confined as it was largely to support of surface forces moving against the Germans and Italians. Most bombing done by Allied air forces in North Africa was hardly strategic. Yet there were compensations. For Arnold, even a North African campaign was preferable to the diversion of bombers to the Pacific—the navy’s desire—inasmuch as it carried the promise of further bases from which to carry out strategic attacks on Italy and Germany. The same promise allowed Arnold to swallow another distasteful decision, to follow up TORCH with operations against Sicily and Italy. And if still subordinated to a sea—land offensive, AAF commanders, supported by Eisen- hower, nonetheless gained independence and unity of command in tactical matters.  But the AAF’s success in Africa as a cooperative arm could also backfire, since it provided support for those
