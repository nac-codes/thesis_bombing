Eisen- hower, nonetheless gained independence and unity of command in tactical matters.  But the AAF’s success in Africa as a cooperative arm could also backfire, since it provided support for those arguing that the cooperative role should be dominant. At best, TORCH’s impact on the air force’s strategic fortunes was double-edged, depleting Eaker’s Eighth Air Force but allowing it time to mount an independent campaign by delaying the invasion of northwestern Europe. But through the autumn of 1942, the new time-lease was used to little avail. True, bombing accuracy was encouraging, despite wild misses like the time bombers struck a French town one hundred miles away from their target. Likewise, the bombers seemed to take an encouraging toll of enemy fighters, so much so that even British newsmen and officers muted their earlier skepticism about American bombing methods. They joined American air force leaders in the mistaken belief that the Luftwaffe was on the wane and the chance for decisive air attack on Germany was near, if only they could stop those diversions.  But the toll of enemy fighters soon shriveled when intelligence officers sifted through the overlapping claims submitted by green crews. “We were living in a fool’s paradise, far as that stuff was concerned,” Curtis LeMay later recalled, and postwar scrutiny indicated that even the revised figures were grossly optimistic.2 Raids against highly fortified German submarine pens on France's western coast—critical targets with the Battle of the Atlantic hanging in balance—showed disappointing results. Other raids into France and Holland were little more than combat training missions. As the new year approached, AAF leaders were jittery about the future of the daylight campaign.  The disappointments were not solely the AAF’s responsibility, although they were exacerbated by its misleading claims on the Eighth’s initial accomplishments. Weather, always the greatest impediment to success, played havoc with every
