congestion in Britain’s airfields and air space sure to result if both British and American bombers were squeezed into the same schedule. Arguing from operational necessity just as the British had in defending their switch to night bombing, Eaker also asserted that his bombers had to strike by day because they were built to do so and the crews were trained only in that method; to switch to the dark would halt the AAF’s offensive altogether for months. Too, only the daylight bomber could engage the German fighter force, depleting it so as to facilitate further bomb- ing as well as ground operations.  There was troublesome logic here. Arguments from operational necessity allowed means to dictate ends—bombing forces, British or American, did what they could do best, not necessarily what it was best to do. Shooting down German fighters became a major achievement of the American bombers, but the initial intention had been to destroy the German air force in its factories and on its airfields. If now it was to be done substantially through the attrition of combat, the task could be grim indeed, especially without long-range fighter escort.  These dangers and anomalies went largely unscrutinized. Other issues, especially a renewed quarrel about the relative priorities of the European and Pacific theaters, dominated the conference. The conferees deliberated little about how strategic bombing would bring about the enemy’s defeat. It was a lapse understandable in light of the imponderables involved, the political questions that would have to be solved, and perhaps also the undertone of confidence entering Allied discussions: expanding resources and opportunities made hard questions about alternative routes to victory less pressing. The crisis over the Eighth Air Force was seen as a tactical, not a strategic, problem. The issue was how best to bomb, not how to win the war through bombing, and the tidy round-the-clock formula averted hard choices even on that matter.  Eaker and
