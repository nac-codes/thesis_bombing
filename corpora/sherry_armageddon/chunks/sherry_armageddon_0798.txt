a tactical, not a strategic, problem. The issue was how best to bomb, not how to win the war through bombing, and the tidy round-the-clock formula averted hard choices even on that matter.  Eaker and Arnold won their case with Churchill and the Combined Chiefs. The upshot of the conference for the Anglo-American air forces was essentially a codification of previous agreements and inclinations. The Combined Chiefs’ formula directed Allied bombers both to destroy the “German military, industrial and economic system” and to undermine “the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened.” The ambiguous wording—“fatally weakened” was a wonderful example—left unanswered the question of what kind of invasion would be required and how its timing would fit with the schedule of bombing. Furthermore, the specific objectives listed—submarine construction yards, the aircraft industry, transportation, oil production, and other enemy industries—left broad latitude to air force commanders and bore little relation to the campaign of area destruction that the RAF mounted with increasing fury. The Allies also accorded the RAF broad authority over Eighth Air Force operations, reserving to American commanders “the technique and method to be employed.” Commanding unquestionably the junior force, American leaders were for the moment content with that provision.*  at . aa ind aoa . a 1 a 1 an . . aan werted a 14 . en 1 ae yas oe . a oo a  Page 147 of 368 34%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON Eaker from England to defend daylight strategic operations. Eaker personally took his case to Churchill, assembling the arguments for the daylight bomber, principally the economy of force achievable  through greater precision. Eaker’s position was tricky, for he had little new to say to the British, and he had to defend the Eighth Air Force without appearing to derogate the RAF’s contribution. As before, the best tack was t
