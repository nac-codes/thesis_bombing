Eaker’s position was tricky, for he had little new to say to the British, and he had to defend the Eighth Air Force without appearing to derogate the RAF’s contribution. As before, the best tack was to deny conflict: British and American operations would be complementary, not competitive, the British destroying urban areas, the Americans hitting bottleneck targets or marking them by fire for British attack at night. Together they would engage the German air force and cause German war-weariness by round-the-clock bombing. Twenty-four-hour operations would also head off the hopeless congestion in Britain’s airfields and air space sure to result if both British and American bombers were squeezed into the same schedule. Arguing from operational necessity just as the British had in defending their switch to night bombing, Eaker also asserted that his bombers had to strike by day because they were built to do so and the crews were trained only in that method; to switch to the dark would halt the AAF’s offensive altogether for months. Too, only the daylight bomber could engage the German fighter force, depleting it so as to facilitate further bomb- ing as well as ground operations.  There was troublesome logic here. Arguments from operational necessity allowed means to dictate ends—bombing forces, British or American, did what they could do best, not necessarily what it was best to do. Shooting down German fighters became a major achievement of the American bombers, but the initial intention had been to destroy the German air force in its factories and on its airfields. If now it was to be done substantially through the attrition of combat, the task could be grim indeed, especially without long-range fighter escort.  These dangers and anomalies went largely unscrutinized. Other issues, especially a renewed quarrel about the relative priorities of the European and Pacific theaters, dominated the conference. The conferees deliberated little about how strategic bombing would
