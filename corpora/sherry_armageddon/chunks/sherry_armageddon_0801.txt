rce operations, reserving to American commanders “the technique and method to be employed.” Commanding unquestionably the junior force, American leaders were for the moment content with that provision.4  Now Arnold and Eaker had more time but only, as it turned out, to meet unexpected challenges. With continued diversions of bombers, trained crews, and shipping to other operations, the Eighth could not attack Germany in force until May, dispatching 279 bombers on the twenty-ninth. The bulk of Eaker’s effort remained directed at German submarines: construction yards in Germany and the concrete pens on the French coast. That campaign substantially failed, not for lack of accuracy but because of enemy resiliency. Entire French port towns were leveled until, as Germany’s Admiral Karl Doenitz declared, “No dog nor cat is left in these towns. Nothing but the submarine shelters remain.”5 Of course, they were all the German navy needed. Likewise, sub-building yards in Germany were struck, but little reduction in production resulted. In what became a recurrent pattern, Allied intelligence also badly underestimated Nazi resourcefulness. Meanwhile, resentment grew in occupied countries over the heavy civilian casualties inflicted by American raids, including those against French and Belgian factories and transportation facilities. Prewar theory had not even anticipated that problem. At best, the Eighth’s gains in the first half of 1943 took the form of hard-won lessons in the tactics, politics, and critical analysis of strategic operations. Earlier hopes of de- molishing the German air force were dashed by increasingly effective enemy fighter tactics as well as by the Eighth’s inability to strike with the force on which those hopes rested.  Arnold and Marshall beat their wings in impatience. Both approached Roosevelt for greater support for the bombing campaign. Marshall advised the president that, owing to lack of numbers, the airmen “have never been able even to approximate
