But these injunctions also revealed his confusion and anxiety at the midpoint of war. Only a few months earlier he had seemed indignant about the very qualms he now raised, maintaining that “this is brutal war and... the way to stop the killing of civilians is to cause so much damage and destruction and death that civilians will demand that their government cease fighting.
