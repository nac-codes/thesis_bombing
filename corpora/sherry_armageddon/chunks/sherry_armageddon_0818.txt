Most critically, the RAF finally introduced “Window”—bundles of aluminum-coated strips which overwhelmed enemy radar. Earlier withheld for fear that the Germans would copy it—they did, since few technical advances in the war waited long for mimicry—Window temporarily blinded fighter defenses. Even the weather cooperated: hot and dry. The second Hamburg raid ignited the war’s first great firestorm.  It was a meteorological phenomenon in its own right. Dropped by 731 attacking bombers, incendiaries started thousands of fires while high explosives blasted open paths by which they could rapidly travel.
