American reporters, free to find satisfaction in the British raids without worry of American culpability, frankly described their objective as “the wrecking of all housing.” But the British press reported the raids in ways typical of what a restrained English historian has called “a three- year period of deceit practised upon the British public and on world opinion.” Newspapers described the targets as “important factories” and “dock quarters” and savaged the few religious leaders who protested.

Politicians on the left had sometimes criticized the strategic bombing effort, not on moral grounds, but because they believed bombing to be a poor substitute for invasion in assisting the Soviet Union. Among RAF airmen, those most familiar with Hamburg’s fate, doubts sometimes arose, but as one later asked, “To whom could you express such doubts? ... What would have been the result?

Moreover, after Hamburg, and until pragmatic concerns imposed some caution, Anglo-American bombers struck Balkan capitals ferociously, attempting to “terrorize Balkan civilians without appearing to use terror tactics.” Planning officers had cause for continued concern, however, for the precise effect of the Hamburg raids on German production was difficult to meas
