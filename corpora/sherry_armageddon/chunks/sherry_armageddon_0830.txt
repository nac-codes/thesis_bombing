to the ease with which men equated the destructiveness of air power with its decisiveness. In this way, too, intentions did not produce results.  The assault on Hamburg also demonstrated the fiction of complementarity. While Harris struck residential areas by night, Eaker hit Hamburg’s docks and factories by day. Yet the AAF strikes were too light and scattered—it was not easy to find targets in a smouldering city—to complement the British effort. British and American bomber staffs met frequently, and requests for supporting efforts were usually received cordially, but the process was ad hoc, geared to missions of the moment, not toward sustaining mutually reinforcing efforts over the life of the aerial campaign.  In Britain, few doubts surfaced about the wisdom of the Hamburg raids and their place in overall strategy. American reporters, free to find satisfaction in the British raids without worry of American culpability, frankly described their objective as “the wrecking of all housing.” But the British press reported the raids in ways typical of what a restrained English historian has called “a three- year period of deceit practised upon the British public and on world opinion.” Newspapers described the targets as “important factories” and “dock quarters” and savaged the few religious leaders who protested. Qualms were recorded by Liddell Hart, two decades earlier the author of a sensational prophecy of air war, and by J. F. C. Fuller, who fulminated against England’s “Goths, Vandals, Huns.” But they had trouble getting into print and failed to have much impact. Politicians on the left had sometimes criticized the strategic bombing effort, not on moral grounds, but because they believed bombing to be a poor substitute for invasion in assisting the Soviet Union. Among RAF airmen, those most familiar with Hamburg’s fate, doubts sometimes arose, but as one later asked, “To whom could you express such doubts? ... What would have been the result? Court martial!”  Ame
