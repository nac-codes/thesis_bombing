g RAF airmen, those most familiar with Hamburg’s fate, doubts sometimes arose, but as one later asked, “To whom could you express such doubts? ... What would have been the result? Court martial!”  American leaders did learn something from the Hamburg assaults. The firestorm was carefully studied by American experts, particularly with an eye to the bombing of Japan. Roosevelt saw in Hamburg “an impressive demonstration” of what America might achieve against Japan, a hope Arnold reinforced for him several months later. Moreover, after Hamburg, and until pragmatic concerns imposed some caution, Anglo-American bombers struck Balkan capitals ferociously, attempting to “terrorize Balkan civilians without appearing to use terror tactics.” Planning officers had cause for continued concern, however, for the precise effect of the Hamburg raids on German production was difficult to measure, and intercepts of diplomatic messages from Japan’s Berlin embassy offered discouraging evidence. More certainly, American experts appreciated that the “numbness and apathy” caused among Germans by Allied bombing might allow only for the further consolidation of Nazi rule.12  Confirmation of that apprehension came over the following winter from a “secret source,” apparently an agent in Berlin. True, on many accounts the agent’s report was encouraging. It described a capital that, after massive RAF raids in November, “has ceased to exist,” mired in defeatism and verging on total anarchy. “To sleep, to take a rest, a bath, or change linen, is the first concern,—not going to work or doing one’s duty.” Germans resented privileges accorded the Nazi elite and resented the destruction the working population endured. “Everybody may abuse everybody. ...
