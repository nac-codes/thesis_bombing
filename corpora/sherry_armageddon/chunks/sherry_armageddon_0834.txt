Japan’s Berlin embassy offered discouraging evidence. More certainly, American experts appreciated that the “numbness and apathy” caused among Germans by Allied bombing might allow only for the further consolidation of Nazi rule.19  Confirmation of that apprehension came over the following winter from a “secret source,” apparently an agent in Berlin. True, on many accounts the agent’s report was encouraging. It described a capital that, after massive RAF raids in November, “has ceased to exist,” mired in defeatism and verging on total anarchy. “To sleep, to take a rest, a bath, or change linen, is the first concern,—not going to work or doing one’s duty.” Germans resented privileges accorded the Nazi elite and resented the destruction the working population endured. “Everybody may abuse everybody. ... Theonly man whom you may not abuse, but whom everybody makes responsible for the destruction of Berlin, is Chancellor Hitler.” Pillage and theft were rampant, the native population petrified that “barbaric hordes” of foreign workers “will plunder the houses and shops still undestroyed.” Returning soldiers were dispirited, officers and businessmen eager for the opportunity to overthrow the vile regime. Many Germans hoped “for the destruction of the industrial districts of Berlin” and were “astonished that ... bombs should be showered on spots where no important installations of the war machinery are located.” Most hated the Nazi system and relieved “their bad conscience” over supporting it “by hiding Jews and providing them with all things necessary.” In short, “the total population of Berlin sits caught in a mouse-trap.” Only the grip of the party, the paralyzing fear of the Soviets, and the survival of the factories prevented collapse or rebellion. But these were critical exceptions. For all the report’s portrait of appalling death, disintegration, and defeatism—and comments perhaps designed to exculpate the German people—it also hinted at RAF failure.2°  But America
