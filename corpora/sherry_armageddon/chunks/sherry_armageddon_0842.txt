That came only in the summer and fall of 1943, yielding an improved P-51 Mustang fighter that was to play a decisive role in the air battles of 1944.  Meanwhile OVFRTARD the Allied invasion of France was fast annrnaching and the time fast diminishing hefore RAF and AAF hamhers would he transformed hv invasion into little more than a  Page 154 of 368 36%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON Now, too, Eaker had a respectable torce—three hundred or more bombers could be sent out with some regularity, and only shortages ot crews prevented a higher rate of attack. He was also running  out of excuses acceptable to Arnold for failing to make effective attacks on Germany. Curtis LeMay, Eaker’s most promising combat commander, later wrote with typical sarcasm that the new offensive “was the outgrowth of a search by those intellectual souls in Plans and Intelligence to find an easy way of winning the war in Europe. That’s just about like searching for the Fountain of Youth—there is no such thing; never was.” But the doctrine behind the summer offensive had been the airmen’s own creation. Combined with political pressures, it led Eaker, who earlier had expanded his operations cautiously, to campaign recklessly.23  From late July through much of October, Eaker’s bombers flew in desperate assaults on German factories, particularly those supplying the Luftwaffe fighter force. On August 17 came the first of two peak efforts. Divided into two forces, 376 B-17s were to strike far into Germany, LeMay’s group at the Messerschmitt factory at Regensburg, another at the ball-bearing complex at Schweinfurt. The two forces were to be synchronized to divide and confuse enemy fighters, LeMay’s to go in first, then fly across the Alps to a base in North Africa. But because of bad weather LeMay’s bombers went on alone, bereft of fighter escort and of the diversion which the succeeding force was to supply. Only hours later could the Schweinfurt group make its strike. Ene
