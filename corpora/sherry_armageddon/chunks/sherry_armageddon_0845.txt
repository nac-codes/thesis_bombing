44.  Meanwhile, OVERLORD, the Allied invasion of France, was fast approaching, and the time fast diminishing before RAF and AAF bombers would be transformed by invasion into little more than a glorified support force for a conventional strategy. And invasion itself would be imperiled if the German air force were not defeated. Far from validating aerial doctrine and rescuing the Eighth’s tenu- ous fortunes, the recent campaign, with losses unavoidably publicized, threw the AAF command into a renewed crisis heightened by the imminence of invasion.  Crisis was also aggravated by a lag in preparations to bomb Japan. Hopes to use Siberian bases for that purpose, as predictably recurrent as the seasons, had generated more staff studies, frustrating negotiations, and no results. Roosevelt on occasion derived optimism from “evidence in the recent disputes between Japan and Russia that the Russians have no cause to love Japan.” But Roosevelt felt more urgency about getting bombers into China, a priority still governed, as so often in the long record of American air power in Asia, more by politics than strategy. Nineteen forty- three brought no relaxation of popular pressures to lay waste first to Japan, “the enemy whom the American people really hated,” as Stimson once pointedly reminded Churchill. Just as important, the bomber could be offered as the token of American support to a client of doubtful loyalty and perseverance. As FDR advised the Joint Chiefs during the Casablanca conference, “periodic bombing raids over Japan... would have a tremendous morale effect on the Chinese people.” The hope also persisted that air power would help defeat Japan without an invasion. FDR signaled to the American public his intention to begin the bombing quickly instead of moving “forward inch by inch, island by island,” a method that “would take about fifty years before we got to Japan.”2¢  After all, Chennault had been promising nothing less than “the collapse of Japan” by methods such
