Spaatz with him in England because the two had already worked together so closely, and the Supreme Commander was not to be denied. But if Arnold took no overt steps to oust Eaker from the Eighth Air Force, he also did nothing to protect him. His long record of badgering Eaker and other commanders suggests that Arnold had found the convenient opportunity to press for better results, which might come with Spaatz in overall command and General James Doolittle in Eaker’s place at Eighth Air Force.  Spaatz inherited an experiment in blind bombing by radar that proved to be a short-run dead end but a significant precedent. Tactical conditions provided the rationale: winter’s heavy cloud cover and the long wait for P-51s reduced opportunities for precision attacks, while the RAF’s “pathfinder” technique, relying on new devices for direction of bombers by radio beams and radar  Page 159 of 368 37%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  December, the Eighth could send out over seven hundred heavies on missions, and it was joined by then by the Fifteenth Air Force based in Italy. Pending arrival of effective long-range fighter escorts, however, these two forces largely marked time.  By this stage in the war, production lines and training camps ground out the interchangeable parts of the war machine with such efficiency that supply no longer posed formidable problems. Differing strategic and political interests were timeless, however, and still mounting as England and the Mediterranean became an impenetrable tangle of bases, competing commands, overlapping jurisdictions, and baroque lines of authority. Plenty only made this tangle more dense and ambitions more intense. In the fall of 1943, the Allies made one last attempt to unscramble it, with only partial success. A renewed effort to streamline target objectives and tighten Anglo-American coordination fell victim to the differing bombing methods of the two air forces and to their wish to continue infor
