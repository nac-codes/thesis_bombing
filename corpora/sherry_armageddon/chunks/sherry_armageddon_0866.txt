k some of the same targets, marking an unusually high degree of coordination between the two forces.  The result was success but of a kind not always anticipated or immediately understood. Again the bombs rained down on German factories, often with impressive accuracy. And yet, after a pause to complete the dispersal of the aviation industry, German fighter production began its striking upward curve, one carried through September and accompanied by manufacture of thirty thou- sand V-weapons. When revealed after the war, that curve seemed astonishing, a final and furious expression of Nazi efficiency.  It was hardly that. It reflected in part the Allies’ inability to follow up their success with repeated attacks, in this case because OVERLORD drew many of the bombers to other targets. It reflected the skillful improvisation of Albert Speer, jerry-rigging ways to tap the sizable cushion of Germany’s war economy. Speer’s prodigies also disguised a slow, subtle defeat for the German air force. In- creasingly, Germany’s aviation became the wartime version of a shop-window air force—formidable in what it could display on a particular day, weak in those categories (reserves, trainers, transports, ground support) that insure long-run success. Furthermore, the quality and numbers of the fighter force were declining relative to Allied strengths. Above all, the lack of aviation fuel became crippling, though not until the summer of 1944. Planes were still mass produced and crews flowed in sufficient numbers, but they were badly trained because they could not get sufficient time in the air and were wasted too quickly in combat to learn the hard way.  Paradoxically, the Allies had a considerable ally in the Nazi high command. Beneath a shell of authoritarian efficiency there operated a feudal system of commands presided over by Hitler’s caprice. He indulged revenge, a luxury he could not afford, in launching the “baby blitz” against England in 1944, first with bombers, then with
