a feudal system of commands presided over by Hitler’s caprice. He indulged revenge, a luxury he could not afford, in launching the “baby blitz” against England in 1944, first with bombers, then with the V-1, a pilotless plane, and the V-2 rocket. Meanwhile, the Luftwaffe attempted an ill-considered strategic bombing operation against Soviet factories. Both efforts consumed precious resources. Moreover, rockets and jet fighters lacked the numbers or the sufficient technological edge to have a decisive effect. and their development was pursued so erraticallv that thev disrupted each other. not to mention the output of more conventional devices.

But if Arnold took no overt steps to oust Eaker from the Eighth Air Force, he also did nothing to protect him. His long record of badgering Eaker and other commanders suggests that Arnold had found the convenient opportunity t
