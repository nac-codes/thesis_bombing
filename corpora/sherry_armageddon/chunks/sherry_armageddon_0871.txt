e attempted an ill-considered strategic bombing operation against Soviet factories. Both efforts consumed precious resources. Moreover, rockets and jet fighters lacked the numbers or the sufficient technological edge to have a decisive effect, and their development was pursued so erratically that they disrupted each other, not to mention the output of more conventional devices. There were Allied mistakes but some at least had the virtue of consistency. By comparison, Hitler’s mistakes, unmonitored (though sometimes subverted) by professional bureaucracy, had consistency only in caprice.  The AAF exploited all these weaknesses through the combat forced on the Luftwaffe. The “Big Week” marked the start of this decisive battle, carried over into March when the AAF repeatedly struck Berlin. The wastage in air combat was vast in February and March. German losses increased to over 2,000 planes a month during the spring as American bombers began the oil offensive, provoking furious German air force resistance, and assisted the Normandy invasion. The German decline was, however, uneven. Flak was becoming more effective, and together with German night fighters it proved deadly in March, downing 9 percent of the huge RAF force attacking Berlin on the night of March 23-24, and 94 out of 795 British bombers dispatched to Nuremburg at the end of the month. Harris had boasted to Churchill, “We can wreck Berlin from end to end” if the Americans joined him, which they did. “It will cost us 400-500 aircraft. It will cost Germany the war.” Instead, it forced Harris to suspend much of his city-busting campaign; he never resumed it with the single-minded intensity shown over the previous year.35  Meanwhile, Harris, Spaatz, and Churchill were strenuously opposing plans to divert their strategic forces to strike the rail network in western Europe in preparation for the invasion. The bomber commanders wanted to get on with the assault on Germany itself, both still convinced that invasion
