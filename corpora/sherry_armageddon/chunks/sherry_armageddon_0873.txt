n sufficient numbers, but they were badly trained because they could not get sufficient time in the air and were wasted too quickly in combat to learn the hard way.  Paradoxically, the Allies had a considerable ally in the Nazi high command. Beneath a shell of authoritarian efficiency there operated a feudal system of commands presided over by Hitler's caprice. He indulged revenge, a luxury he could not afford, in launching the “baby blitz” against England in 1944, first with bombers, then with the V-1, a pilotless plane, and the V-2 rocket. Meanwhile, the Luftwaffe attempted an ill-considered strategic bombing operation against Soviet factories. Both efforts consumed precious resources. Moreover, rockets and jet fighters lacked the numbers or the sufficient technological edge to have a decisive effect, and their development was pursued so erratically that they disrupted each other, not to mention the output of more conventional devices. There were Allied mistakes but some at least had the virtue of consistency. By comparison, Hitler’s mistakes, unmonitored (though sometimes subverted) by professional bureaucracy, had consistency only in caprice.  The AAF exploited all these weaknesses through the combat forced on the Luftwaffe. The “Big Week” marked the start of this decisive battle, carried over into March when the AAF repeatedly struck Berlin. The wastage in air combat was vast in February and March. German losses increased to over 2,000 planes a month during the spring as American bombers began the oil offensive, provoking furious German air force resistance, and assisted the Normandy invasion. The German decline was, however, uneven. Flak was becoming more effective, and together with German night fighters it proved deadly in March, downing 9 percent of the huge RAF force attacking Berlin on the night of March 23-24, and 94 out of 795 British bombers dispatched to Nuremburg at the end of the month. Harris had boasted to Churchill, “We can wreck Berlin from end
