still disputed forty years later, was considerable, and the thousands of casualties among friendly civilians were still far fewer than anticipated in more dire forecasts. Meanwhile Spaatz, on the cheap and a bit on the sly, began the oil campaign anyway. Whatever their other merits, these splintered campaigns inflicted further attrition on the opposing German air force in the west. By D-Day, Goering’s air force could not seriously challenge American day bombers and fighter escorts nor the tactical aircraft spearheading the Allied invasion. Harris had been saved by the unwelcome diversion from the further em- barrassment his bombers would have suffered at the hands of flak and fighters protecting German cities.  In these complex and shifting aerial campaigns carried on from February through June, means and ends in Allied air strategy had been neatly reversed from those posited in original plans. Where once defeat of the enemy in the skies had been seen as a preliminary to the bombing of his factories—at that, a preliminary American airmen had hoped to reduce through their bombers’ for- midable defensive capability—now the bombing was a prod to engage the Luftwaffe, the bombers themselves bait to lure it into combat.  The air force’s historians acknowledged this shift but concluded that “in terms of final results it matters little whether . .. the German planes were destroyed in the factories, on the ground, or in the skies.”37 In fact it mattered a great deal, for it greatly altered the costs and nature of victory as well as the doctrine on which the air force rested its claim to supremacy and virtue. If precision attacks did not paralyze the enemy’s war economy, then victory could not come until his forces were defeated in battle and his territory occupied, precisely the traditional method of war the air prophets had hoped to avoid. And if victory came in the traditional way, the air force served fundamentally to complement traditional strategies, succeeding by a g
