2  Preparation of bases for the new Twentieth Air Force involved a trail of operations strung from the United States across the Pacific or the Atlantic-Middle Eastern route to India, where the primary bases were established, and then deep into China. At trail’s end work proceeded by impressing a third of a million Chinese using the crudest hand methods in service to the most complex modern technology; perhaps the story was only apocryphal that the hapless Chinese who fell before the giant hand-pulled rollers used to pack runways were simply ground underneath. The building of B-29 bases was a feat that led contemporaries to seek “analogies in the building of the great pyramid of Cheops.” And the physical demands of the project were not the only ones preoccupying Washington. Chiang’s demands for money to finance the project were so imposing that the Twentieth Air Force’s own historian, writing in 1945, reached a coy conclusion: “One does speak of black- mail on the part of an ally, but at best this was very shrewd trading,” so shrewd that it helped make the B-29 operations from China “among the most costly of the war.”43  The Manhattan Project, itself a worry to a select few in the air force, showed how the disjunction between technical means and strategic ends was not confined to the relatively humdrum novelty of the B-29s but perversely increased in proportion to a weapon's promise. By the winter of 1943—44, all theoretical obstacles to construction of atomic bombs had been solved, and the project had become a massive engineering enterprise. Initiated with a German threat in mind, its potential use against Japan began sliding into plans with scarcely any formal review of the shift. The possibility of Germany’s surrender before the bomb was ready was one factor, but both Truk and Tokyo were mentioned as targets as early as May 1943, long before dates for the end of the European war or the bomb’s readiness could be predicted with precision. By 1944, the technicians’ p
