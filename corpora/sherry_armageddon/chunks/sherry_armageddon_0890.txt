Truk and Tokyo were mentioned as targets as early as May 1943, long before dates for the end of the European war or the bomb’s readiness could be predicted with precision. By 1944, the technicians’ preparations for using the bomb against Japan were going forward. Apparently policymakers were assuming such use, but they rarely discussed it: their energies were still geared to countless remaining technical problems, and the formal rationale for building the bomb remained the “race between Germany and ourselves on a winner-take-all basis.” When Roosevelt in September 1944 asked Vannevar Bush, his chief scientific advisor, about use against Japan, Bush replied that the issue could be “postponed for quite a time.” Only Roosevelt, by methods lost to the historian, had made up his mind explicitly, agreeing that month with Churchill (but neglecting to tell his advisors) that the bomb “might perhaps, after mature consideration, be used against the Japanese.”*4 To be sure, means did not have to crowd out ends—they did not for Roosevelt. Nonetheless, the pattern of concerns roughly mir- rored those evident in development of “conventional” weapons like the B-29.  Finally, articulation of long-range strategy fell victim to interservice wrangles whose dimensions dwarfed what went on in Europe. There the compactness of the theater compelled at least a measure of integration among the three services and the two nations. In the Pacific, Americans were relatively free of pressure from allies. This relative freedom, however, only weakened strategy- making further. Britain in particular generated endless debate over matters peripheral to the main American effort, without forcing articulation of the fundamentals of strategy. Among the American services, the inner war over favored methods, routes, and commanders never ceased. Bound by informal rules of unanimity and watched over by a commander-in-chief tolerant of disagreement among subordinates, the Joint Chiefs did the only thing a co
