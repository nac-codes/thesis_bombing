routes, and commanders never ceased. Bound by informal rules of unanimity and watched over by a commander-in-chief tolerant of disagreement among subordinates, the Joint Chiefs did the only thing a committee could do: it compromised. If no choice could be made among approaches to Japan through the central Pacific or north from Australia or in the air with strategic bombers, all three would be taken. If one service's representative could not be granted a supreme command, then give MacArthur one force, the navy’s Nimitz an- other, and Arnold himself command of the new Twentieth Air Force.  This approach to war was not as fractious as it sometimes seemed. The distances involved in the Pacific worked against a centralized command of the sort Eisenhower had in Europe. The services often needed each other, with the air force especially dependent on the navy’s plan to seize and supply the Marianas. Less parochial commanders welcomed contributions from rival services; Admiral Chester Nimitz, doubtful that sea power alone could defeat Japan, was eager to see Japan “get the kind of thorough city-by-city demolition Germany is getting now.”45 But compromise bred  Page 164 of 368 38%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  Arnold took it to Roosevelt was it settled, in the air force’s favor. As Roosevelt put it to Chennault, “I have had a hope that we could get at least one bombing expedition against Tokio before the second anniversary of Doolittle’s flight. I really believe the morale effect would help!” Bombers in Australia could not do that.44  In strategic terms, Roosevelt’s decision, based as it was on long-standing political considerations, settled little. The debate had taken place in a familiar vacuum of policy because neither side could relate its position to an agreed-upon strategy for victory. Those seeking to strike at Japan’s ships and fuel in the southwest Pacific looked toward a quick payoff that would assist an advance on Japan by ground and
