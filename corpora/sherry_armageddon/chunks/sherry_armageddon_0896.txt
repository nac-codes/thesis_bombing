rthur’s favor —another reminder that dubious campaigns were not confined to air force commanders. Furthermore, troubled minds within the services did urge the streamlining of Allied strategy, in much the same way that some officers sought to streamline Anglo-American bombing. Their efforts bore little fruit.  In this climate of strategic indecision, assumptions about the methods and purposes of air war again often revealed themselves in peripheral issues: the fate of American POWs in Japanese hands; release of information about Japanese atrocities; and possibilities of gas warfare. By September 1943, evidence of atrocities against American captives had mounted, and journalists were eager to break the story. Roosevelt and the War Department feared that early release would jeopardize efforts to deliver Red Cross supplies for American POWs in Japanese hands. In the longer run, both strategy and public opinion were at issue. Marshall wanted “the storm of bitterness” sure to arise in the United States upon release of the story to “be directed along carefully thought out lines rather  Page 166 of 368 38%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  Indecision stemmed in part from the one premise about global strategy that had governed since 1941: concentration on Europe first. Even in January 1944, invasion of Japan seemed too remote to compel close attention to what role it would have in victory over Japan. In addition, military leaders preferred, as they had often during the war, to address logistical and technological problems before deciding on strategy, and those problems loomed far larger for the Pacific than for Europe. Shipping over vast ocean distances and over the land hurdles of Asia imposed the most intractable obstacle. When Marshall had commented on the “massive effort here to get a pin point out there,” he described not only a strategic problem but the orientation of staff in Washington. Admirals and generals often worried about getting the
