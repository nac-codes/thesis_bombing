on the “massive effort here to get a pin point out there,” he described not only a strategic problem but the orientation of staff in Washington. Admirals and generals often worried about getting the forces out there before pondering what to do with them.  Mundane problems tugged hard at Arnold over the winter of 1943-44, especially regarding the B-29. Embodying several technological advances, it was nonetheless rushed into production without testing of prototypes, so that the new aircraft required extensive modification before they became suitable for combat. In the meantime, the bomber’s troubles spawned a highly critical inquiry from Senator Harry Truman’s committee watching over mobilization for the war. Because Boeing could not handle all the orders for the new bomber, they were parceled out to automotive and other aviation firms, adding to the complexities of production. More than once delays infuriated Arnold and found him roaming about the country inspecting facilities that left him “appalled.”42  Preparation of bases for the new Twentieth Air Force involved a trail of operations strung from the United States across the Pacific or the Atlantic-Middle Eastern route to India, where the primary bases were established, and then deep into China. At trail’s end work proceeded by impressing a third of a million Chinese using the crudest hand methods in service to the most complex modern technology; perhaps the story was only apocryphal that the hapless Chinese who fell before the giant hand-pulled rollers used to pack runways were simply ground underneath. The building of B-29 bases was a feat that led contemporaries to seek “analogies in the building of the great pyramid of Cheops.” And the physical demands of the project were not the only ones preoccupying Washington. Chiang’s demands for money to finance the project were so imposing that the Twentieth Air Force’s own historian, writing in 1945, reached a coy conclusion: “One does speak of black- mail on the part
