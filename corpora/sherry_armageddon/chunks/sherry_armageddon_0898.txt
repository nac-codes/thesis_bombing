. Chiang’s demands for money to finance the project were so imposing that the Twentieth Air Force’s own historian, writing in 1945, reached a coy conclusion: “One does speak of black- mail on the part of an ally, but at best this was very shrewd trading,” so shrewd that it helped make the B-29 operations from China “among the most costly of the war.”43  The Manhattan Project, itself a worry to a select few in the air force, showed how the disjunction between technical means and strategic ends was not confined to the relatively humdrum novelty of the B-29s but perversely increased in proportion to a weapon's promise. By the winter of 1943—44, all theoretical obstacles to construction of atomic bombs had been solved, and the project had become a massive engineering enterprise. Initiated with a German threat in mind, its potential use against Japan began sliding into plans with scarcely any formal review of the shift. The possibility of Germany’s surrender before the bomb was ready was one factor, but both Truk and Tokyo were mentioned as targets as early as May 1943, long before dates for the end of the European war or the bomb’s readiness could be predicted with precision. By 1944, the technicians’ preparations for using the bomb against Japan were going forward. Apparently policymakers were assuming such use, but they rarely discussed it: their energies were still geared to countless remaining technical problems, and the formal rationale for building the bomb remained the “race between Germany and ourselves on a winner-take-all basis.” When Roosevelt in September 1944 asked Vannevar Bush, his chief scientific advisor, about use against Japan, Bush replied that the issue could be “postponed for quite a time.” Only Roosevelt, by methods lost to the historian, had made up his mind explicitly, agreeing that month with Churchill (but neglecting to tell his advisors) that the bomb “might perhaps, after mature consideration, be used against the Japanese.” To be sure, means
