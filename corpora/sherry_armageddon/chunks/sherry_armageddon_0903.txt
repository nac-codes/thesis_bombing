ounted, and journalists were eager to break the story. Roosevelt and the War Department feared that early release would jeopardize efforts to deliver Red Cross supplies for American POWs in Japanese hands. In the longer run, both strategy and public opinion were at issue. Marshall wanted “the storm of bitterness” sure to arise in the United States upon release of the story to “be directed along carefully thought out lines rather than left to dissipate itself in a lurid press and unpredictable reactions.” The problem, that is, was to bend popular reactions toward more effective mobilization of the war effort. More pointedly, as the joint staff planners saw the issue, release of the stories should be saved until later in order to “steel public opinion to the damage which, at that time, we are about to inflict upon the Japanese homeland.”  At the Office of War Information, Elmer Davis shared similar concerns. Against the incomprehensible Japanese enemy, he worried, “it is more difficult to demand of the nation the exacting sacrifices” necessary for victory. In January 1944, when the government decided to lift the ban on atrocity stories, Davis got more specific. American knowledge of atrocities “would also serve to nullify any voices that might be raised here if we should undertake bombing of Japanese cities.” But what worked at home might backfire against Americans in Japanese hands: playing up atrocity stories only increased the likelihood that Japan “will execute all prisoners” taken from American bombers, perhaps indeed all other Americans the Japanese held as well, so Arnold’s intelligence officer warned. The legitimacy of that concern was evidenced by the execution earlier of three Doolittle raiders and by death sentences later imposed on B-29 aviators who fell into Japanese hands. But there was no easy way to avert further Japanese brutalities: few officials wanted to pass up the propaganda opportunity available in publicizing Japanese atrocities, much less act
