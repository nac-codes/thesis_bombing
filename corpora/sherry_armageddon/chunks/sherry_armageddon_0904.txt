Japanese hands. But there was no easy way to avert further Japanese brutalities: few officials wanted to pass up the propaganda opportunity available in publicizing Japanese atrocities, much less act to stop widespread American mistreatment and execution of Japanese captives, a practice that only further sanctioned Japanese wrongdoing. As few Japanese were in American hands, Marshall told the president that the only deterrent to Japanese war crimes was to threaten that “the future of Japan as a nation, in fact that of the Japanese race itself,” would be jeopardized if Japan took reprisals against American airmen. Here was a threat of extinction from which Roosevelt had backed away when a similar issue had arisen with respect to Germany.4¢  Responses to the POW dilemma displayed reinforcing anxieties and expectations about the coming air campaign. For all that the Nazis were doing in the death camps, about which American officials now had mounting evidence, they still viewed the Japanese as the more savage enemy, hence less open to limited threats. American leaders were planning their own savage campaign against Japanese cities, their flammability the object of frequent comment and temptation. Japanese savagery served as justification for the American campaign and protection against any moral doubts, official or public, about carrying it out. Countervailing forces that occasionally arose in the European campaign—concern over the fate of friendly civilians and religious institutions—rarely appeared inideliberations about air war against Japan.47  Restraints against the use of weapons deemed morally abhorrent were also fewer in the Pacific theater, and insofar as they existed, they arose in part out of European politics and strategy. By 1943, both sides in both theaters had made chemical and biological warfare the object of lavish anxiety, extensive preparations, and grisly testing that sometimes gpt out of hand. In the Pacific, not even the scruple of the Geneva Proto
