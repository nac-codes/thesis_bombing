At the Office of War Information, Elmer Davis shared similar concerns. Against the incomprehensible Japanese enemy, he worried, “it is more difficult to demand of the nation the exacting sacrifices” necessary for victory. In January 1944, when the government decided to lift the ban on atrocity stories, Davis got more specific. American knowledge of atrocities “would also serve to nullify any voices that might be raised here if we should undertake bombing of Japanese cities.” But what worked at home might backfire against Americans in Japanese hands: playing up atrocity stories only increased the likelihood that Japan “will execute all prisoners” taken from American bombers, perhaps indeed all other Americans the Japanese held as well, so Arnold’s intelligence officer warned. The legitimacy of that concern was evidenced by the execution earlier of three Doolittle raiders and by death sentences later imposed on B-29 aviators who fell into Japanese hands. But there was no easy way to avert further Japanese brutalities: few officials wanted to pass up the propaganda opportunity available in publicizing Japanese atrocities, much less act to stop widespread American mistreatment and execution of Japanese captives, a practice that only further sanctioned Japanese wrongdoing. As few Japanese were in American hands, Marshall told the president that the only deterrent to Japanese war crimes was to threaten that “the future of Japan as a nation, in fact that of the Japanese race itself,” would be jeopardized if Japan took reprisals against American airmen. Here was a threat of extinction from which Roosevelt had backed away when a similar issue had arisen with respect to Germany.4®  Responses to the POW dilemma displayed reinforcing anxieties and expectations about the coming air campaign. For all that the Nazis were doing in the death camps, about which American officials now had mounting evidence, they still viewed the Japanese as the more savage enemy, hence less open to li
