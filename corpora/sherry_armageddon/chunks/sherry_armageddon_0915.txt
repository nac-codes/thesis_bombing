each only the southernmost targets in Japan, and those only with a reduced bomb load and on infrequent missions.  They should not have been sent to China. The military dividends of their operations mainly took the form of training for crews and commanders and shaking down of the untested bombers —necessities of war which could have been met elsewhere to more effect and with less waste. Even those dividends were compromised by the lead time the early missions offered to the Japanese for testing out their antiaircraft and civilian defenses in advance of the heavy assaults to come. Marshall and his staff had apparently considered junking the whole China project in February; it was scaled back in the spring even before it got started and doubts resurfaced in the summer. What kept the project going was Roosevelt’s insistence, rooted in political and diplomatic calculations, and the reluc- tance of his military subordinates to offer challenge on a matter so dear to him.  Of course, the services had never developed the strategic plan with which to contest such operations. Few criteria existed by which to sift out the essential from the merely possible. Top strategists, often referring to the flammability of Japan’s cities, had argued in 1943 that “the defeat of Japan may be accomplished by sea and air blockade and intensive air bombardment.” But by the end of June 1944, staff planners were explicitly challenging that assumption as “overly optimistic.” Over the succeeding months, British and American strategists treated invasion as a certainty rather than a contingency in case blockade and bombardment failed. As they did so, they breathed precision and integration into strategic plans.52  Ironic counterpoint to the inauguration of air attacks on Japan, the new caution about success without invasion was not shared by all, and it resulted from no systematic study of the relative merits of invasion and strategic devastation or the relationship between them. Doubt simply crept
