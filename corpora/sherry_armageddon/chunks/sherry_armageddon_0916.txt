cess without invasion was not shared by all, and it resulted from no systematic study of the relative merits of invasion and strategic devastation or the relationship between them. Doubt simply crept in during review of countless plans on the particulars of strategy. The slow progress of the Combined Bomber Offensive against Germany may have dampened optimism; more certainly, it taught Arnold and the air force to promise less, whatever their private hopes. Blockade and bombardment, even if successful—as the navy’s Admiral King thought they would be, at less cost in lives—might work too slowly in light of the “American public’s distaste for long wars of attrition,” a main concern for the army. Nor was there any consensus on which method promised fewer casualties.

Washington, already growing cautious about claiming too much, had to control further its desire to exploit the Twentieth Air Force’s work in the press.*2  Well it did, too, for that force’s 20th Bomber Com
