Of course, the services had never developed the strategic plan with which to contest such operations. Few criteria existed by which to sift out the essential from the merely possible. Top strategists, often referring to the flammability of Japan’s cities, had argued in 1943 that “the defeat of Japan may be accomplished by sea and air blockade and intensive air bombardment.” But by the end of June 1944, staff planners were explicitly challenging that assumption as “overly optimistic.” Over the succeeding months, British and American strategists treated invasion as a certainty rather than a contingency in case blockade and bombardment failed. As they did so, they breathed precision and integration into strategic plans.52  Ironic counterpoint to the inauguration of air attacks on Japan, the new caution about success without invasion was not shared by all, and it resulted from no systematic study of the relative merits of invasion and strategic devastation or the relationship between them. Doubt simply crept in during review of countless plans on the particulars of strategy. The slow progress of the Combined Bomber Offensive against Germany may have dampened optimism; more certainly, it taught Arnold and the air force to promise less, whatever their private hopes. Blockade and bombardment, even if successful—as the navy’s Admiral King thought they would be, at less cost in lives—might work too slowly in light of the “American public’s distaste for long wars of attrition,” a main concern for the army. Nor was there any consensus on which method promised fewer casualties. Too, reliance on naval and air power alone would idle the army’s vast forces, which might be employed to speed up victory when finished with Germany.*3  The shift in emphasis toward invasion also reflected the declining influence in Allied councils of the British, with their preference for patient and
