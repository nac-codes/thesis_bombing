nticipation than in actuality. Similarly, attention to air power, to the moral and strategic issues it raised, had usually been greatest when the bombers themselves were of little use. By the time they began full operation, these issues faded because expectations themselves had shifted and other strategies demanded attention and created new hopes. In short, the least scrutiny was paid to bombing just when it was wreaking the most havoc. Britain’s leaders had anguished over the role of the strategic bomber in the late 1930s and in 1940-42, when large efforts were imagined and small ones begun, but except for the renewed scrutiny demanded by OVERLORD early in 1944, British and American air forces were largely free to go their own way in the last year of the war. With regard to the war against Japan, too, discussion of air power peaked in the winter of 1943- 44. After that, attention focused on ground and naval campaigns preparatory to invasion. Similarly, popular attention to air power had been intense when little else was going on but declined by June 1944, despite some more realistic journalism and the air force’s momentary ecstasy over reaction to the Yawata mission.  Expectations for how the bomber’s record would be revealed also proved to be erroneous. Earlier prophecies and plans, from the 1930s and the first years of the war, had foreseen the period of bomber operations as a chronologically discrete phase: the bombers would wage their campaign, and then, if necessary, other forces would follow. Few had imagined that the bomber war would cli- max simultaneously with the efforts of armies and navies. It was supposed to exist in splendid isolation, exposed to the undistracted glare of moral and strategic observation.  Expectations for air war were thus doubly erroneous—about its effectiveness and its exposure to scrutiny. Facing the disappointment of politicians and public, the men waging the bomber war redoubled their effort to prosecute it in hopes of seizing a
