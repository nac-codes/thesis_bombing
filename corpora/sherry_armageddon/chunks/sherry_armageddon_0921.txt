s—about its effectiveness and its exposure to scrutiny. Facing the disappointment of politicians and public, the men waging the bomber war redoubled their effort to prosecute it in hopes of seizing a recognizably decisive contribution to victory. At the same time as they escalated, their audiences were less likely to pay attention to what they were doing; their strategic devastation accumulated with few questions asked.  Air war had evolved far from what it had been in 1941, much less from what had been imagined earlier. Yet the distance from which people viewed and understood it persisted. To be sure, ignorance and misunderstanding now sprang less from lack of access to experience, more from willful choices to disregard. And the promise of the bomber, as the weapon of humane decisiveness, was  Page 169 of 368 39%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  Of course, the services had never developed the strategic plan with which to contest such operations. Few criteria existed by which to sift out the essential from the merely possible. Top strategists, often referring to the flammability of Japan’s cities, had argued in 1943 that “the defeat of Japan may be accomplished by sea and air blockade and intensive air bombardment.” But by the end of June 1944, staff planners were explicitly challenging that assumption as “overly optimistic.” Over the succeeding months, British and American strategists treated invasion as a certainty rather than a contingency in case blockade and bombardment failed. As they did so, they breathed precision and integration into strategic plans.52  Ironic counterpoint to the inauguration of air attacks on Japan, the new caution about success without invasion was not shared by all, and it resulted from no systematic study of the relative merits of invasion and strategic devastation or the relationship between them. Doubt simply crept in during review of countless plans on the particulars of strategy. The slow progress of the
