the bomber’s record would be revealed also proved to be erroneous. Earlier prophecies and plans, from the 1930s and the first years of the war, had foreseen the period of bomber operations as a chronologically discrete phase: the bombers would wage their campaign, and then, if necessary, other forces would follow. Few had imagined that the bomber war would cli- max simultaneously with the efforts of armies and navies. It was supposed to exist in splendid isolation, exposed to the undistracted glare of moral and strategic observation.  Expectations for air war were thus doubly erroneous—about its effectiveness and its exposure to scrutiny. Facing the disappointment of politicians and public, the men waging the bomber war redoubled their effort to prosecute it in hopes of seizing a recognizably decisive contribution to victory. At the same time as they escalated, their audiences were less likely to pay attention to what they were doing; their strategic devastation accumulated with few questions asked.  Air war had evolved far from what it had been in 1941, much less from what had been imagined earlier. Yet the distance from which people viewed and understood it persisted. To be sure, ignorance and misunderstanding now sprang less from lack of access to experience, more from willful choices to disregard. And the promise of the bomber, as the weapon of humane decisiveness, was attenuated. But change in circumstances and rhetoric should not be overemphasized. Earlier generations had recourse to less experience, but still to a good deal which they largely chose to ignore. The promise of the bomber had not so much disappeared as taken on more subtle expression. Air war still had a singular capacity simultaneously to attract hope and repel examination. As a weapon of apocalypse, now carrying it out, the bomber still elicited those reactions it had before the war and would after it: the twin temptations to employ it and look away from it.
