gression are driven by an uncontrollable impulse to hit back regardless of the consequences.5=  Liddell Hart wrote before the shattering of myths about the coolly calculating Nazi regime—which in fact operated like “barbaric hordes”—and before scholars established how calculating Allied leaders often were. Nonetheless he captured one reason that bombing was attractive to Americans during the war: for a nation that coveted not territory but influence and revenge, air power was an ideal weapon. It promised punishment, meted out too impersonally to compel close attention to the motive of revenge, and with no danger the enemy would retaliate in kind. In that sense, the remote- ness of air power was not simply a permissive factor—not something that merely allowed air war to go on for other reasons—but was itself one of its appealing characteristics.  That appeal did not alone compel the use of the bomber as an instrument of strategic devastation. Certainly it does not capture the language and reasoning employed by most proponents and agents of the bombing effort. Most often, they cited variations of a necessitarian argument. Strategic bombing, they usually said, was dictated by the requirements of defeating tenacious foes, minimizing losses, and making the best use of resources. The necessitarian argument also informed much of the pioneering scholarship on the air war. Thus Noble Frankland, coauthor of a formidable history of the RAF’s strategic air compaigns, argued regarding escalation of British bombing from 1940 to 1942:  Allthe arguments based on strategic and economic reasons which have gone on since 1940 and, surprisingly, still go on, about the alternatives of this or that kind of attack are wholly groundless for oper- ational reasons alone. The alternative to area bombing was either no strategic bombing or daylight bombing. In the circumstances of the time, the idea of abandoning strategic bombing was scarcely a prac- ticable proposition though there were those
