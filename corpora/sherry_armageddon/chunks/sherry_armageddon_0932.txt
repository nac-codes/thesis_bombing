ombing was either no strategic bombing or daylight bombing. In the circumstances of the time, the idea of abandoning strategic bombing was scarcely a prac- ticable proposition though there were those who presently claimed that it might have been.  In The Road to Total War, F. M. Sallager reached similar conclusions: “Operational considerations, not moral sentiments or strategic objectives, governed what was actually done as the strategic bombing offensive developed. ... As the war unfolded, the decisionmakers became as much the prisoners as they were directors of the forces they had unleashed.” In short, the RAF had been compelled to attack cities if it was to make use of the bomber resources at hand. A similar argument from operational necessity often informed the American rationale for a different tactic, daylight precision bombing in Europe. Both crew training and the capacities of the B-17 and B-24 bombers made them seem suitable for little else.*©  The historians who locate escalation in the compelling force of operational necessity are not insensitive to the tragic impact of the bombing that resulted nor to motives for revenge and aggrandizement. But they place such motives on the fringes of policy. While there is no fast distinction between motive and rationalization, the argument from operational necessity must be treated with the greatest caution, inasmuch as it often cloaked in a kind of technological determinism what leaders wanted to do for other reasons they did not often admit openly.  Operational necessities did not appear mysteriously. If leaders were prisoners of a technological determinism, it was one they themselves set into motion. They reasoned in a curiously self- fulfilling fashion when, having first created certain forces with certain capabilities, they then complained that they had no choice but to use them in unfortunate ways. In fact, however, well- placed leaders sometimes revealed how politics rather than technology guided them, as when
