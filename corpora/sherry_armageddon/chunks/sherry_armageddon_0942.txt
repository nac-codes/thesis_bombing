ng actively—in the field, as one might say—even with no declared war in progress.” That qualification may seem dishonest to those familiar with LeMay’s reputation for bellicosity in the 1960s. Yet it rang true with the record of his own thoughts and accomplishments. He took greatest delight in his success at forging combat-worthy organizations—commanding the first American bombers in Europe in 1942, when he “felt the intimacy of proven human devotion,” deploying the fledgling force of B-29s in the fall of 1944, building the new Strategic Air Command out of the chaos of postwar demobilization.2  Of course, LeMay knew that these triumphs bore their fruit in combat. But what he prized most was his leadership in getting men ready for war. He excelled at fashioning reliable crews out of green trainees, ill-prepared for the smoke and confusion of battle. Always willing to experiment, he toyed with different bomber formations and bombing patterns and jerry-rigged new methods of maintenance and repair in order to increase the force available. When crew morale sagged in the face of hopeless odds against survival, LeMay turned despair into expedient fatalism. “Everybody would get shot down, and the last B-17 would take off from Britain in early March; and Ira Eaker, by his own testimony, would be on it. So morale went up. If there’s no escape, you don’t experience combat fatigue.” At the same time, as he was no martinet, LeMay offered escape for some—for those whose nerves were shot, he would prescribe different duty, and for the cowardly, he would “pack up the so-and-so and send him home.”4 Operational challenges preoccupied LeMay, and for him joy lay in command itself—less for the power it bestowed or the victory it promised than for the cre- ative skill it demanded.  LeMay had little time or interest to explore the strategy or politics of air power. Before the war his rank had been too junior to place him in the service schools and the planning offices where these matters
