sloppy uniforms, slatternly salutes, and general shoddiness,” practices which indeed had official sanction in air force policy.? Disinterest in military tradition and in strategic doctrine went hand in hand. When LeMay and Arnold wrote their memoirs, neither said much about strategy; their memoirs faithfully reflected the focus of their wartime experience.  Similarly, LeMay and Arnold lacked a strong sense of the political and ideological meaning of war, the one being fought in 1944 or the ones that might come in the future. Fascism, genocide, hegemony, freedom, national interests—these were simply not in their vocabularies. The task, not the purpose, of winning governed. Much the same was true for other Americans also during the war as well as for ranking officers in other services. But the parochial nature of the air officer’s experience exacerbated that tendency—their remoteness from high political circles, the complex demands of the technology they operated, their distance from the fields of combat and the furnaces of mass killing.  At times, this parochialism left the airmen refreshingly free of ideological biases. LeMay recounted with evident appreciation the assistance he received from Mao’s communists during the war. When he wrote his memoirs, these men had become the nation’s enemies, yet LeMay bore no retrospective animosity, only a casual sense of history’s irony, which he also felt about the twists of history that found him first leveling Japan’s cities, only to receive an award from the Japanese government at the height of the cold war, and then to drive a Honda in retirement. For men like Arnold and LeMay, it was as if other nations were bad because they were enemies, not the other way around. They rarely articulated how ideology or national interest was at stake. Their job was to win a war.  Such an attitude did not prevent a certain involvement in politics. Air force generals fought relentlessly for the resources necessary to do the job as they saw
