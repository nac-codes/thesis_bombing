Beyond recognizing that getting bombs on target was more likely to win the war than not getting them on target, most American airmen did little to explain how increased effort would secure speedier victory. The absence of concerted strategic thinking on that problem had the advantage of leaving them free to change tactics, in notable contrast to the RAF’s Harris, who clung tenaciously to one method of bombing throughout the war. But improvisation without a clear strategy risked redundant or purposeless destruction and the subversion of ends by means.  In order to amass and employ those means, Arnold and LeMay drove their subordinates hard. In contrast to the orderly way in which Marshall and Eisenhower worked through the staff system, both violated customary procedures of command, consultation, and concurrence. Their casualness reflected a disdain for those procedures as well as the peacetime air force’s lack of an established cadre of administrators and its style of personal leadership, one possible when the air officer corps had numbered only in the hundreds.
