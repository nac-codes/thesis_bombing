WER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  To a surprising degree, Arnold shared that mentality despite his much loftier perch. Though a veteran of battles over air power and a defender of the AAF’s interests, he was never an articulate or visionary exponent of air power on a doctrinal level. Almost everyone close to Arnold saw him as “in no sense a thoughtful, precise thinker but a doer.”® Had he been a visionary, he might never have become the air force’s commanding general, and those who were mostly had fallen from the ranks.

Marshall and Eisenhower knew history, and by virtue of long association with military and political leaders, they understood politics.
