from Marshall, after each he rested briefly. But he could not really acknowlege the precariousness of his own health any more than he could the dangers of an overtaxed organ- ization. He soon slipped back into a pace that he imposed on others and that helped alienate him from his wife and family. He was, like LeMay, a transparent man who never elicited the contrasting impressions that a Roosevelt or an Eisenhower triggered; he lacked guile and subtlety, the capacity to act deviously or operate on multiple levels. Arnold also differed from some other military leaders— Marshall and Stimson, for example, also tired and overburdened men—in his stubborn refusal to delegate authority and in his inability to find outlets for affection and relaxation.

He worked his subordinates hard but rarely showed the capriciousness and ruthlessness that Arnold displayed. His job with the 20th Bomber Command was a thankless one.
