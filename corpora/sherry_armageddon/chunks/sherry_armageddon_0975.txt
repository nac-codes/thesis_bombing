hat Japan would be defeated quickly by blockade and bombardment alone. It also prevented arousal of expectations for the B-29’s performance that might later cause an adverse reaction against the air force. It was no time, as the AAF advised corporate advertisers, to “imply that the B-29 is a mighty juggernaut which almost single-handedly is capable of reducing Japan to the point of surrender.”15  Caution implied no abandonment of the air force's political goals, however. Arnold wrote LeMay on October 5 that he did “not want a high-pressure B-29 publicity program and we are making no effort to maintain constant publicity,” but days earlier he had written to another Pacific commander that he was “extremely concerned” over press attention given MacArthur and Halsey. On October 15, General Lauris Norstad, Arnold’s chief of staff for the Twentieth Air Force, issued one of the few wrist-slappings LeMay ever received, chiding him on the matter of press coverage: “We have been seriously upset particularly in our public relations because of the delay in receiving your mission results.”16  Arnold’s staff was especially determined to centralize the release of all information about the Twentieth Air Force through its Washington headquarters rather than through field commanders and correspondents.
