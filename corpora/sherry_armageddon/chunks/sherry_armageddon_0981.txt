And as the press fell in line with official claims of selective attacks on economic targets, no consciences were stirred in advance of the assault by fire still in the planning stages.

Arnold believed that Americans would support in its place a powerful air force making few demands on manpower and responding to public anxieties, nourished by the air force itself, about defending against future Pearl Harbors. He pursued that argument with Marshall, Stimson, and the media.2!  The AAF also benefited from the way some Americans linked their interest in a new international organization with the ascendancy of air power.
