On November 11, the 21st Bomber Command’s public relations officer was directed to stress “that specific objectives within the city were bombed so that nobody will get [the] impression general havoc or general conflagration was intended or accomplished.”!2 A narrow, literal truth—Hansell’s command was not then attempting to raise a “general conflagration”— disguised the air force’s intent to do so.

No such quibbles arose at the time, however, and by the end of 1944 the air force was pleased with the results of its cautious press policy. Norstad noted that the “conservatism of our news has in itself been news,” something “commented on editorially in several instances.”2° Conservatism helped the transition of the air force’s image from that of brash adolescent to one of a mature organiza- tion.
