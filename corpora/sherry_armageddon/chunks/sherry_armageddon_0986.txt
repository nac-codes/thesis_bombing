d to “police the world” without wasting “one moment in talking before raising ordinary hell” with aggressors. Yet Bishop imagined a horrible war of intercontinental missiles and bombers, and his emphasis was more on saving the world from air power than through it. Another pessimist, Emile Gauvreau, warned of how powerful airplane manufacturers would exert irresistible pressures to secure contracts and promote a new international arms trade in deadly aircraft, throwing in his own prediction, made in 1944, of the dangers of atomic bombs. As visions of evils to come, however, both tracts were limited: danger came less from the potential of modern technology than from the stupidity or evil machinations of great nations or powerful individuals. The dominant impulse remained evident in proposals like Allan Michie’s: Keep the Peace Through Air Power.23  For Arnold and the air force, these proposals were of little concern except as hopeful signs of a coming awareness of aviation’s dominance in world relations and national policy. The air force was both an instigator and a beneficiary of the perception of a new air age; in a seamless world, both threats and opportunities for the United States would arise most anywhere in the world, threats arriving with the cataclysmic suddenness of Hitler’s V-2 rockets. It was a perception shared by liberal one-worlders, self-conscious practitioners of realpolitik, scientists creating the new technology, and conservators of strategic tradition like Marshall. Of course a common perception did not always lead to the same prescriptions about the future role of American air power. It did encompass anx- ieties and aspirations on which Arnold’s air force capitalized with considerable success.  It also buttressed Arnold's effort to fulfill his second objective in postwar policy: developing the technology for future American air superiority by institutionalizing the air force’s relationship with the scientific community. That relationship had been
