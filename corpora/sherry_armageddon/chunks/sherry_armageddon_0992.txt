in uni- form helped to define how Americans regarded and prosecuted strategic bombing.  While the other services were also broadening their use of civilian expertise, Arnold’s air force was at the forefront of this development. Its flexibility in employing civilian talent was one key both to American superiority in the air and to the air force’s emergence as the dominant military service. Contemporaries generally explained the forging of a close alliance among the air force, industry, and science in the same way they explained so many developments of the war: as a product of technological and operational imperatives. In their view, the very nature of air war—its pre- mium on the most sophisticated technology—compelled a more vigorous use of civilian talent.  As did the argument from operational necessities in its other forms, this version had a truth to it. The cutting edge of military technology did lie largely in the weaponry of air war. But that argument confused effect with cause, technological determinism with elites’ choices. The technology of air war was at the cutting edge in part because of the political decisions men made. If the pace of technological change alone had been the determining factor, the navy might have matched the air force’s success in employing civilian talent, for it had long pioneered new technologies, and its carrier aviation had many of the same technological needs as the air force. And yet its use of civilian science and industrial technology was generally less aggressive than the air force’s and marked by more fractious relations between scientists and the officer corps. Another example is more pointed: despite great technological advances, the Luftwaffe was notably deficient in recognition of civilian talent and ahilitw ta work harmonionely with it Much the same was trie af the Tananese air forces ac well At mast technalagical change offered a hroad challense which nations and nartieular aroan-  Page 184 of 368 42%  THE RISE OF AMER
