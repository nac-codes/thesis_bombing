To perpetuate it Arnold turned to Theodore von Karman, a prominent Hungarian aerodynamicist who had come to the California Institute of Technology in 1926. By 1944, the two knew each other well. To von Karman, Arnold was nothing less than “the greatest example of the U.S. military man—a combination of com- plete logic, mingled with farsightedness and superb dedication.” A “fanatic on air power,” perhaps, but all the more admirable for it.24  In the fall of 1944, Arnold established von Karman as head of a new Scientific Advisory Group for the air force and ordered him to look far into the technological future. According to von Karman’s dramatic account, the two rendezvoused at a remote corner of La Guardia airport, Arnold dismissed his chauffeur (“Not another ear was in sight”), and the general disclosed his plans. As fleshed out by his staff, Arnold’s rationale for a permanent alliance of officers and scientists was both political and strategic. The strategic danger to the United States lay largely in the unfolding technological revolution: the United States would face enemies and the possibility of “global war” waged by offensive weapons of great sophistication. But the American response would be shaped by considerations of domestic politics. The United States had to reverse “the mistakes of unpreparedness prior to World War II,” particularly the failure to harness civilian science to military needs. And technological development would respond to “a fundamental principle of democracy that personnel casualties are distasteful. We will continue to fight mechanical rather than manpower wars.”25  Arnold had a certain brutal foresight into the shape of wars to come,
