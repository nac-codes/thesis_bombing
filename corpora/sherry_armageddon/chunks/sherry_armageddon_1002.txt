air officer: even Arnold’s references to the “long-haired boys” assisting the air force mixed affection with the layman’s bewilderment about the scientists’ curious ways.28 Yet cultural distance and rivalry for influence never seriously impeded the deepening of the military-civilian alliance.  The air officers’ relative lack of isolation from civilian society also arose from their professional and class background. At the top ranks, airmen had followed largely the same professional paths as had ground army officers, but they were somewhat younger and less often the product of the service academies, a substantial number having been educated at prestigious technical institutions.22 Some divergence between air officers and others was also sustained down through the ranks. Air forces demanded a higher proportion of technically trained personnel and had much higher ratios of officers to men. The American air force thus recruited from a higher level of class and educational background, maintained during the war first through requirements for two years of college educa-  Page 187 of 368 43%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  =e niatanni cee SSE ee eee ee ee ee ag Ip Sa i a ee See ER eee pee ee  cooperation: since the establishment i in 1915 of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), its membership comprising both federal officials and private scientists and developers. While maintaining some facilities of its own, NACA also contracted with universities and private corporations, a method scientists usually preferred because it preserved their professional autonomy. NACA was the prototype for the mobilization of industrial and academic science during World War II, adopted by its prewar chairman, Vannevar Bush of MIT, as a model for the National Defense Research Committee in 1940. Thus well before American entry into the war, the airmen had more experience with the conditions under which scientists and industrial laboratories would h
