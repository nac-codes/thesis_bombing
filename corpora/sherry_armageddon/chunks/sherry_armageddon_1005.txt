ning what contemporaries called the Winged Superchildren of Tomorrow, civilian educators and businessmen forged links between the civil and military spheres that were unique among the armed services to the air force.22 Moreover, once recruited, men were assigned combat flying roles only if they volunteered for them, a practice which sustained the elite status of airmen, as did the long, sophisticated training they received. Des- pite their higher educational background, airmen were also younger than army soldiers and officers.  In sum, airmen—by class and education, by their relative youth, by their sheer numbers, and by the era’s infatuation with aviation—were attuned to the demands of modern technology, organization, and civilian expertise. Cause and effect may be difficult to sort out—the air force’s emerging supremacy both reflected its class composition and gave rise to it. But when contemporaries took note of the elite nature of the wartime air force, they intuitively observed that class was at work, perhaps in ominous ways: as air force historians speculated darkly in 1944, the high casualty rate suffered among air officers might deprive the United States of its elite youth in much the way that Ypres and Passchendaele and other world War I battles had done to England. Whatever the price, the elite composition of the air force helped it forge its alliance with civilian professions and authorities.31  At bottom, that alliance also strengthened a broader linkage among American elites, one imperfectly established during World War I, partially dismantled after it, and indissolubly fixed during World War II. It was just this success in linking elites that accounted for much of Allied success in the air—British and Russian as well as American. Their enemies failed in that regard because their rulers relied on ideals of military service and party ideology rather than on “military materialism.”32 Trusting their zeal to win the war, they miscalculated the demands of wa
