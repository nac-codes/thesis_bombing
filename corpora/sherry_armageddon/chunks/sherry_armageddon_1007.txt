these novelties, to balance the benefits of their introduction against the costs of disrupting industrial routine. The triumph of a narrow form of technological creativity seriously impeded Axis efforts to develop assembly-line production, and this curtailed output of some types more seriously than did Allied bombing.  In contrast, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States developed effective methods of coordinating the efforts of officers, scientists, developers, and manufacturers. Conflicting claims on resources were monitored. Production models were frozen for extended periods. Modifications were selectively introduced. New projects were put on hold unless they promised a payoff in the current war, sacrificing a measure of technological creativity to reliable abundance. Exceptions occurred but primarily when excess of industrial and technical capacity accrued late in the war (some plants  wrara alraady cealing hack fram fill nraductian oftar 1049)  iv force had excelled at mulitary-civihan  Page 187 of 368 43%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON LELIMIULUB IED, AVIALIULL LAU LIE CLEALESL VELICLILD LOL CIVIL LL CULLMMELCE, 1 UELELULE CIVIL) ABELIUIES UL BUVELLIIENIL, LIKE LUE VEpAl UNELIL UL CUMUIELCE dilu LILe DULEAU UL OLALLUdLUDd, Ad WELL ad PlivaLe Ue-  velopers readily cooperated with the prewar Air Corps.  The air force’s low peacetime status worked to its wartime benefit in other ways. After World War I, disgruntled airmen often left the service, but in doing so some forged close links with civilian technology—Eddie Rickenbacker in the airline industry, Jimmy Doolittle as head of Shell Oil’s aviation department after graduate work at MIT. More broadly, because the officer corps of airmen had been so small before the war and then swamped with demands for expansion, it was forced after 1940 to recruit heavily from the ranks of civilian talent and to turn to private industry for help. This was the case, for example, in organizin
