ir forces demanded a higher proportion of technically trained personnel and had much higher ratios of officers to men. The American air force thus recruited from a higher level of class and educational background, maintained during the war first through requirements for two years of college educa- tion for many personnel and later through other screening devices.  Methods of recruitment also strengthened the airmen’s bonds with civilian society. The air force aggressively recruited on college campuses and among clubs for flying and model-building. Furthermore, during the war civilian institutions rapidly expanded their indoctrination of American youth in the virtues and techniques of aviation. In training what contemporaries called the Winged Superchildren of Tomorrow, civilian educators and businessmen forged links between the civil and military spheres that were unique among the armed services to the air force.22 Moreover, once recruited, men were assigned combat flying roles only if they volunteered for them, a practice which sustained the elite status of airmen, as did the long, sophisticated training they received. Des- pite their higher educational background, airmen were also younger than army soldiers and officers.  In sum, airmen—by class and education, by their relative youth, by their sheer numbers, and by the era’s infatuation with aviation—were attuned to the demands of modern technology, organization, and civilian expertise. Cause and effect may be difficult to sort out—the air force’s emerging supremacy both reflected its class composition and gave rise to it. But when contemporaries took note of the elite nature of the wartime air force, they intuitively observed that class was at work, perhaps in ominous ways: as air force historians speculated darkly in 1944, the high casualty rate suffered among air officers might deprive the United States of its elite youth in much the way that Ypres and Passchendaele and other world War I battles had done to Eng
