expend machines rather than men,” a policy also comforting to the staff historians. Placing “their faith in the tank, the plane and the armored car,” Germany and Japan had “sacrificed to the United States their only major advantage,” their superiority in mobilizing and motivating mass armies, by waging a technological and economic struggle at which the United States excelled. “American  Page 189 of 368 43%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  WELE alicauy oLalliis VaCn 11UiiL Ud prUuUULLiLL alter tore).  To be sure, Nazi rulers wanted to exploit the existing technical and industrial system, not destroy it. But heavy-handed exploitation denied the state the expertise needed to coordinate highly dispersed and complex institutions, despite belated efforts by Germany and Japan to rationalize production and make use of civilian experts. The latter remained servants, not partners, in the war effort. The final irony was that fascist totalitarianism produced far less centralization than the Allies achieved. Generals or party bureaucrats might rule particular fiefdoms with an iron hand, but no informed authority ruled over them. The Allies excelled in rationalizing production and linking laboratory to industry, the high command and the field. Cooperation proved more efficient than coercion.  The faultline did not lie simply between capitalism and totalitarianism, however, as evidenced by Soviet success in the production war. Perhaps the distinction lay in the Allies’ capacity to embrace modernism itself—not so much its gadgetry as its technique, rationalization, and integration of elites into a cooperative effort. That was just what Japan’s intellectuals, but not its leaders, realized when they “grasped the meaning of the Pacific war as ‘the overcoming of modernity.” “The important social consequence of the war for the Allied powers,” Overy concludes, “was not breaking down social barriers between classes—in fact they were in most cases confirmed—but
