not, the most admired Americans were not battlefield leaders but experts in preparing for war—the demigods of science who developed radar and constructed atomic bombs, the organizers of victory like Marshall and Eisenhower. The scientists’ role and Roosevelt’s aggressive effort to expand the Air Corps testified to civilians’ “interference” and their success in making combat “more absolute.” Not that generals often disliked the outcome. As Arnold’s interest in new technologies suggested, what characterized the Anglo-Americans at war was the coalescence, not the divergence, of civilian and military purpose and values. Military elites embraced civilian expertise, civilian elites embraced mili-  tary purposes.

The business of aviation reminded one manufacturer “of those toy  rubber balloons you buy at the circus. Blow them up and they look like a fat pig. Release the pressure and they collapse with a plaintive dying sequel [sic], a wrinkled remnant of overstressed rubber.” Few firms believed they could count on a reliable military market after the war; government guarantees were designed as a hedge against its collapse. Not even a considerate government provided full protection against excess capacity, and wartime profits had to be limited, or at least artfully disguised, lest the industry face again the bitter complaints of profiteering endured after World War I. Still, expansion was remarkable, and government generous. Nearly $4 billion—one-sixth of all wartime investment in manufacturing—went into the aviation industry. Washington provided 89 percent of it.36  These wide-ranging differences between the Axis and Allied methods of mobilizing for and waging air war have prompted some to attribute the defeat of the Axis states in part to their
