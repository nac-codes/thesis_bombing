ical basis, what a blessing for the world.” The wartime records and memoirs of many civilians reveal scarcely more concern with the ideological and political issues of the war than generals like LeMay and Arnold displayed. As the British scientist Solly Zuckerman recalled, when Hitler came to power “whatever concern I may have felt, even this I suppressed at the time.” Indeed, his interest in the geopolitical, moral, and ideological issues of the war never emerged strongly.41  Insofar as a broader outlook united most of these men, it lay in a fairly commonplace desire to assist in securing a rapid victory at minimal cost. Typical in outlook was Edward L. Bowles. Neither a rarefied theoretician nor a simple plodder in the trenches of technology, Bowles was a decent, ambitious, and talented man, reflective without being seriously troubled. As professor of electrical communications at MIT, he had presided over pioneering work in radio communications and radiation and in the process established contacts with leading industrial laboratories and interested individuals in the military. Tapped by Bush in 1939 to work on radar, he carved out a role which included not only responsibility for all AAF communications, radar, and elecironies, but, as special consultant to Stimson and Arnold, authority to examine operational difficulties in the antisubmarine war, in Allied countermeasures against German V-weapons, and in the bombing campaign against Japan. “If there was anything I wanted,” he later recalled, “it was to be mixed up with the overall operations of the military.”42  He got what he wanted. Lacking the brilliance of an Oppenheimer or the empire-building talents of a Vannevar Bush, Bowles still knew how to work the fringes of power, eschewing messianic claims for the role of science in decision making and in saving mankind. Instead, in perhaps a reflection of how the engineer’s mentality differed from that of the physicist, he relied on a self- effacing demonstration of
