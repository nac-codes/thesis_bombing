science in decision making and in saving mankind. Instead, in perhaps a reflection of how the engineer’s mentality differed from that of the physicist, he relied on a self- effacing demonstration of how scientific expertise could solve military problems, particularly in bridging the gap between the invention of new devices and their effective use in warfare—the heart of operations research. His methods earned from Stimson, Arnold, and Marshall a trust they did not bestow on more strong-willed scientists. Bowles returned respect in good measure. If Arnold was an “opportunist” with “the instincts of a lower animal,” insensitive to the issues and nuances of strategy, he was what the air force needed to get a “bunch of overgrown chauffeurs into shape.” Bowles himself was after all an opportunist, though of deft skill rather than brutal force, determined to get on with winning the war, as impatient with questions of strategic theory as he was with the grander philosophizing of some of his scientific colleagues. No wonder, then, that he “loved the old man,” who in turn “had so much faith in me it was dangerous.”43  Bowles brought to his far-flung activities the scientist’s joy in observing and the wonderment of the small-town boy thrown into high-powered circles. He showed few strong feelings about the enemv or the war’s nurnose. When he visited Sainan late in the war. he found inspiration in the “snirit of this enternrise. its magnitude and beautv” that carried him “into the realm of enchantment  Page 192 of 368 44%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON ULL SCLELILUICa Ly AVUUL...
