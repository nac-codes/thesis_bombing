Perera, again played an important role, as did George Ball and Paul Nitze. There were less conventional figures, such as the economist John Kenneth Galbraith; they were especially evident on the lower levels of the survey staff—the poet W. H. Auden, the young Marxist economist Paul Baran. But by 1944 these class and professional connections, in a war which had already thrown these men together in other duties, were largely self-sustaining. “All in all,” notes a historian regarding recruitment of the survey staff, “the process was rather more ‘clubby’ than most Americans might tend to presume.”42 At bottom recruitment reflected also the rapprochement with corporate and professional elites achieved by the Roosevelt administration at the start of the war.  For professional officers, motivation for war work was in one sense a moot point—war was their job anyway, and no additional motive was needed. Scientists, lawyers, and businessmen had to change what they were doing, and therefore motivation tended to be more discrete and focused. But their diversity was notable. The most famous among them, the atomic scientists, included men fleeing from fascism, determined that Germany not get the bomb first, as well as Americans like Robert Oppenheimer whose ideological revulsion against fascism was strong. But such men composed only a portion of the team working on the bomb, much less of the larger community of civilian experts. To some scientists, antifascism was grounded heavily in professional concerns—Nazism had sabotaged the German science they had held in such respect and the internationalism of science they found essential to progress. Much of von Karman’s animus against Germany arose from that source: “The technical people of the world know how to talk to one another. If only one could put all problems on a technical basis, what a blessing for the world.” The wartime records and memoirs of many civilians reveal scarcely more concern with the ideological and political iss
