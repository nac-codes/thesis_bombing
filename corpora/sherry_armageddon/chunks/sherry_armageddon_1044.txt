Nazi extermination policies] exaggerated,” as Ball admitted in his memoirs. Charity operated with these Americans less than a fascination with their enemies, or as Ball put it, with the possibility that Speer “seemed, to use Noel Coward's derisive phrases, ‘like us.’”46  As Freeman Dyson has pointed out in describing his own experiences, even those who grappled with the moral dimensions of the war found participation in it easy to rationalize and a sense of purpose increasingly elusive. Near the end of the war and of his service as operations analyst with the RAF’s Bomber Command, he asked himself how “I let myself become involved in this crazy game of murder.”  At the beginning of the war, I believed fiercely in the brotherhood of man, called myself a follower of Gandhi, and was morally opposed to all violence. After a year of war I retreated and said, Unfortunately nonviolent resistance against Hitler is impracticable, but I am still morally opposed to bombing. A couple of years later I said, Unfortunately it seems that bombing is necessary in order to win the war, and so Iam willing to go to work for Bomber Command, but I am still morally opposed to bombing cities indiscriminately. After I arrived at Bomber Command I said, Unfortunately it turns out that we are after all bombing cities indiscriminately, but this is morally justified, as it is helping to win the war. A year later I said, Unfortunately it seems that our bombing is not really helping to win the war, but at least Iam morally justified in working to save the lives of the bomber crews. In the last spring of the war I could no longer find any excuses.  Partly in reaction to the loss of “excuses,” Dyson charted a unique course of fascination with the German enemy that slopped over into admiration. By war’s end, he “began more and more to envy the technicians on the other side who were helping the German night fighter crews to defend their homes and families.” They had “a cause clean to fight for.” Dyson
