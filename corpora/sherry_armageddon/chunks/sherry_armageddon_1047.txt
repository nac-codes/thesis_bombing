own tent quarters.” Though less stridently than earlier generations, elite Americans still found war attractive as a force to discipline and unify a diverse nation. “We have gained stature and strengthened fibre,” Stearns remarked of his university. He was not so different from Curtis LeMay in locating the satisfactions of war as much in process as in result.45  Similarly, Guido Perera admired the air force officers he met early in the war, finding with them a camaraderie and excitement he had missed in civilian life. Like other members of the Strategic Bombing Survey, he also took pleasure in his cordial interviews with high German industrial and military figures at the close of the war, men who “spoke effectively and well—without rancor,” as he recalled of one such occasion. “Toasts were drunk to the U.S. Air Forces, as the winner, to the Luftwaffe, as the loser.” Perera “couldn’t help wondering . . . how they would have behaved if they had won the war,” but it seemed enjoyable to play Grant to Germany’s Lees, and not simply for Perera. Men with more evident abhorrence for Nazism—George Ball and John Kenneth Galbraith—also put the whisky on the table and found that Albert Speer “evoked in us a sympathy of which we were secretly ashamed,” in part because they still “tended to think those rumors [about Nazi extermination policies] exaggerated,” as Ball admitted in his memoirs. Charity operated with these Americans less than a fascination with their enemies, or as Ball put it, with the possibility that Speer “seemed, to use Noel Coward’s derisive phrases, ‘like us.’”46  As Freeman Dyson has pointed out in describing his own experiences, even those who grappled with the moral dimensions of the war found participation in it easy to rationalize and a sense of purpose increasingly elusive. Near the end of the war and of his service as operations analyst with the RAF’s Bomber Command, he asked himself how “I let myself become involved in this crazy game of murder.”  At t
