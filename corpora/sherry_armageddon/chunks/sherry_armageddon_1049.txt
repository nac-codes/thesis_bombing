murderous” methods arose from a war begun “in a spirit of comradeship and self-sacrifice,” or how unclean the German cause was even at war’s end—how many Germans still killed subject peoples rather than defend the homeland, how their leaders could be more blunderingly wasteful of their own men than Bomber Command was with its cannon fodder. In his own peculiar manner, however, Dyson charted the ethical ambiguity which many civilian experts sustained through the war: their difficulty in ascertaining just what made their cause the right one or sometimes even in making the attempt.4”  To be sure, unlike Bowles, Perera, and Stearns, men like Dyson, Ball, and Galbraith tried to set an ethical compass by pitting themselves against generals and admirals. They found military bureaucracy stifling and the military mind parochial and self-serving, its methods brutal and wasteful. Yet they recount with such pleasure the various struggles they waged that their claimed distaste for wartime service seems disingenuous. They enjoyed violating military protocol just as the airmen did with the older services; both groups came across a bit like small boys enjoying pranks against their elders. Berating airmen for the wastefulness of their bombing methods and their blindness to the civilians’ rational findings, these experts presented themselves, as Ball did in commenting on arguments over targeting in 1944, as “interested only in making as objective an assessment as possible.”48 Yet the tone and substance of their arguments suggested they desired something more: rec- ognition of their status and the superiority of their minds in the making of war.  “Command turned simple men into prima donnas,” Zuckerman complained of his military superiors, but he did not recognize that war might do much the same to men like himself. Zuckerman’s own parochialism mirrored what he attacked in others. “Operational problems, I discovered [after the war], savoured more of the characteristics of biological e
