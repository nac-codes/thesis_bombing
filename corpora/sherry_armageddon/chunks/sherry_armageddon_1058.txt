incompetence and Allied superiority did not alone decide the war—if they had, there would have been no need actually to fight it; they opened opportunities for victory, but only when transformed by strategy into the fact of defeat and surrender. Galbraith’s memoirs glided over the role played by strategic bombing in that regard. He seemed more interested in ridiculing the benighted state of the military mind than in ex- ploring why the course of bombing unfolded as it did.52  It would be as foolish to make cardboard figures of the civilian critics as it was for the critics to do with the “air barons” they condemned. At their best, they measured their judgments— Zuckerman, for example, finding much to admire in Eisenhower, Tedder, and Spaatz—and their observations into the organizational mentality of bureaucratic warfare had a special incisiveness. But few civilians joined Dyson in seeing themselves as part of that mentality, not just victims and opponents of it, and few admitted that scientists, academicians, and lawyers brought not only a technique but a set of parochial interests to war-making.  Theodore von Karman showed how those interests could be successfully pursued in the narrowest way. Von Karman was a promoter, globe-trotter, and scientific jack of-all-trades whose interests spanned rocketry, space travel, jet propulsion, military aviation—any activity where aerodynamics came into play. Although he caught Arnold’s attention in the 1930s with his warnings of German and Italian progress in aviation and rocketry, he did not quickly choose sides in the emerging world struggle, content in 1937 to advise both the Chinese Air Force and Japanese universities; at the same time Arnold was using Air Corps funds to rescue von Karman’s fledgling program in rocketry and jet propulsion at Caltech. Earlier, he had worked for Germany in World War I and for the avi- ation industries in Germany, Japan, and the United States in the 1920s. At best, he demonstrated the interna
