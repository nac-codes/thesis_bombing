ialism and war.” Oppenheimer, like many scientists, also preserved an image of his own restraint and humaneness by measuring these virtues against the aggressive designs attributed to the military. He wanted the bomb made and tested, said a colleague, so that it would not “become a secret of the military which they could use to control the government with after the war.” The running battle with General Leslie Groves and the military command engaged in by some scientists reinforced the scientists’ sense of moral and intellectual superiority. For some, too, not even this war shattered their faith in an international community of science rescuing the world from stubborn nationalism.  But the most powerful protection against experiencing doubt was immersion in fascinating and demanding work, just as doubt arose when scientists were removed from the mainstream of work on the bomb—among the Chicago scientists, whose more theoretical work had been completed earlier. By contrast, few scientists at Los Alamos, working at fever pitch until the very last  mamoant falt thay had timatn anactinn A chaar daolichtin nrahlam calwina eanciwmad tham haichtanad hu tha annarmane nraceura wndar uthich thaw laharad hy tha euddan laan inta antarnrica af ouch  Page 201 of 368 46%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  welcomed the opportunity te seize the very powers of the gods themselvas, Ii science, ircedcin alc Krivwicupe iad diways cee inseparable from control—te unlock the secrets of nature is alsote sub due and seize its power. It hardly could have been otherwise for the men at Los Alamos.  What makes such speculation hard to confirm is the reticence of men who “let Oppenheimer take protective custody of their emotions”*4 and the difficulty of interpreting those revelations they did offer. Too, the relationship between scientist and invention was far different in the 1940s from what it had been even a few decades earlier, when nothing stood between inventor and
