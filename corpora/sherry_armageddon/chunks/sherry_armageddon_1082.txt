effort to perfect the aerial bomber.  By defining their work as a kind of fail-safe effort against the possibility of a Nazi bomb, scientists also maintained the illusion of benign purposes. At the time of the Trinity test, Samuel Allison offered James Conant his belated realization: “They’re going to take this thing over and fry hundreds of Japanese!” Somehow, he had believed until then that it would be otherwise. Oppenheimer kept doubt at bay in different ways. Trinity “betokened a greater explosion to come—one that would shake mankind free from parochialism and war.” Oppenheimer, like many scientists, also preserved an image of his own restraint and humaneness by measuring these virtues against the aggressive designs attributed to the military. He wanted the bomb made and tested, said a colleague, so that it would not “become a secret of the military which they could use to control the government with after the war.” The running battle with General Leslie Groves and the military command engaged in by some scientists reinforced the scientists’ sense of moral and intellectual superiority. For some, too, not even this war shattered their faith in an international community of science rescuing the world from stubborn nationalism.  But the most powerful protection against experiencing doubt was immersion in fascinating and demanding work, just as doubt arose when scientists were removed from the mainstream of work on the bbmb—among the Chicago scientists, whose more theoretical work had been completed earlier. By contrast, few scientists at Los Alamos, working at fever pitch until the very last moment, felt they had time to question. A sheer delight in problem solving consumed them, heightened by the enormous pressure under which they labored, by the sudden leap into enterprise of such importance that the younger scientists experienced, and by the intellectually charged atmosphere Oppenheimer provided. Freeman Dyson later discovered that “they did not just build the
