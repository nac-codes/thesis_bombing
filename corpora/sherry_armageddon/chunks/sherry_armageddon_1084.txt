d, however, suffering 52,173 of the 291,557 battle deaths inflicted on all Americans during the war (the RAF lost 70,253 in operations, 47,268 in Bomber Command). Since combat personnel comprised a smaller proportion of the air force than they did in the rest of the army, the risks once one was assigned to combat were higher in the air force than in ground forces. Airmen also were more likely to be captured by the enemy, and they ran a much greater chance of being missing in action and later declared dead. Furthermore, officers perished in unusual numbers in the AAF because a far higher proportion of the air force were officers (about half of combat flying personnel): twice as many air officers died in battle than in all the rest of the army, despite its larger size. Moreover, 35,946 airmen died in noncombat situations, about 43 percent of all such deaths in the wartime army. In 1943 alone, 850 airmen died in 298 B-24 accidents in the states, leaving the survivors “scared to death of their airplanes.” Away from combat, the airmen’s scourge was not the soldier’s traditional one of disease, but the severe danger of training, ferrying, and other kinds of aerial accidents. In sum, the risks for airmen, though sometimes peculiar, were large.§2  During the war, medical statisticians examined the fate of a pool of 2,051 personnel who began a series of twenty-five missions for the Eighth Air Force, the principal American air force bombing Germany. Only 559, or 26.8 percent of these men, completed all their missions. Eleven hundred ninety-five were either killed or missing in action but often later certified as fatalities. Another 15.8 percent were lost to the force because of severe wounds or by death or disease incurred outside combat or by removal from flying for administrative reasons. On average, almost 4 percent of the force were killed or missing in action on each mission, and the mean number of missions completed for the entire group was 14.72, barely past the halfwa
