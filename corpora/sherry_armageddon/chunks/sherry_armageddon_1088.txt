how one squadron might be decimated in a few weeks and another emerge almost unscathed after many missions.  The airman’s anxiety in combat took peculiar forms. Confinement in a highly cramped machine often caused a sense of helplessness experienced also by the submariner. The greater risk of capture by the enemy was a fearsome prospect in the war against the Japanese, who sometimes tried and beheaded airmen for alleged war crimes. Heavy bomber crews also suffered the special strain of responsibility for comrades. When LeMay and his flight surgeons talked to one squadron commander who “flopped on us” after some brutal missions, they learned he “was not worried about himself. He had not gone yellow; he was perfectly willing to see himself expended. ... But he simply couldn’t bring himself to the point of taking another crew into combat, and then losing some of them. It had happened too often.”S4  Indeed, as air force psychiatrists found, emotional collapse often stemmed from the impossible decisions a bomber crewman sometimes had to make:  So close are the men to each other, so bound together by a common purpose and a common fate, that one individual’s combat career cannot come to a different conclusion from that of his comrades without pain. This leads to innumerable situations where a man must choose between a hero’s death, without in the least desiring to be a hero, or life in the future with a bad conscience and a constant feeling of depression and guilt. If he chooses the first course of action, he may receive a posthumous decoration and a place of honor in that section of paradise reserved for airmen, but the act will have been due to the impossibility of leaving his friends or letting them down.... .  Even when therp has been no choice, and survival is due to the sheerest whim of fate, . . . the ‘survivor’s guilt’ haunts the individual; he is ‘ghosted,’ as one man put it, by his dead friends, who will not leave him alone or give him peace of mind.
