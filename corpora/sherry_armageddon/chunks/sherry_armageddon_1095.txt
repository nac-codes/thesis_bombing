enced and inexperienced crews were mown down as impartially as the boys who walked into the German machine gun nests in the battle of the Somme in 1916.” Dyson attributed this to failures in the gunnery system of the British bombers, failures he waged a futile battle to correct. A colleague also discovered that the escape rate of British bomber crews—their chances of bailing out from damaged or malfunctioning bombers and surviving—was less than half that for American bomber crews, again because of a technical failure difficult to correct due to “the entrenched inertia of the military establishment.” No wonder that RAF fliers found that “the line between the living and the dead was very thin,” as one wrote: “it is as if those who have gone have merely caught an earlier train to the same destination.” American bomber crews at least had the satisfaction of a declining loss rate as they gained experience, plus the probability that 50 percent of their numbers would escape from bombers downed in operations.§©  Even for them, however, the emotional toll was exacting, and doctors who treated serious emotional problems among crewmen found themselves in “a wasteland in which to wander, filled with shadows of theories, dusty slogans, and dire predictions.” Lack of experience in the stresses of combat aviation was one problem. The flight surgeon also served clienteles with conflicting interests: the operational commander trying to increase missions, the combat crew needing protection from a comrade’s dangerous behavior, and the individual flier, who might underestimate his capacity to fly or, just as dangerous, overestimate that ability. The doctor’s uncertain middle course between these claims “was to help the men carry on to the limit of their capacity, and then perhaps fly a few more missions.” A punitive attitude toward emotional problems was widespread in the armed forces, but it was mitigated by the real affection of some commanders for their men and by the enormous inves
