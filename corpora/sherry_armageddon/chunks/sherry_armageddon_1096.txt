more missions.” A punitive attitude toward emotional problems was widespread in the armed forces, but it was mitigated by the real affection of some commanders for their men and by the enormous investment the air force had in its flying personnel, who were too few and too expensive to be summarily cashiered. Moreover, although combat aviation offered peculiar stresses, cases of gross regression to infantile states were less common among airmen than among ground soldiers; the precarious task of flying, the fine motor and sensory skills it required, and the AAF’s superior psychiatric services led to earlier identification of severe problems.®  Still, for both flight surgeons and psychiatrists in rear areas treatment was always a struggle because of the unpredictable or intractable problems they confronted. The best doctors perceived keen limits on their predictive and curative abilities. Proud or frightened men masked symptoms adroitly; the triggers to anxiety and dysfunction were too multiple and environmental; and combat aviation, like other branches of service, did not always reward the “normal” or unconflicted personality. Thus the mildly neurotic man might fare better simply because his previous experience with anxiety left him less surprised and frightened by experiencing it in battle or because for the first time he might “be able to feel as well as his neighbor.” More dismaying, models of treatment from civilian life had little relevance. There the environmental stimuli to trauma might be controlled or altered to some extent. “In battle,” however, “the stress is never concluded, nor can it be controlled. Rather, the intent is to increase the stress continually in the furious pursuit of victory.” In the realm of their work, air force psychiatrists acknowledged, “a hair divides the normal from the neurotic, the adaptive from the nonadaptive. The failures of adaption of the soldier... mirror Everyman’s everyday failures or neurotic compromises with reality.”®8
