hair divides the normal from the neurotic, the adaptive from the nonadaptive. The failures of adaption of the soldier... mirror Everyman’s everyday failures or neurotic compromises with reality.”®8  Flight surgeons and psychiatrists offered several responses to combat stress, performing a triple role as counselor, paternal figure, and therapist. Severe cases required hospitalization, in the zone of operations or back in the states, where the favored treatment became narcosynthesis—drug-induced reenactment of a traumatic episode to assist the ego in mastering or accepting it. But the best treatment was benign rather than invasive: leaves from combat duty and fixed tours, for which doctors lobbied hard. Even rest was minimally effective, for fear and stress built up regardless of the frequency with which missions were spaced. In short, simple physical and emotional exhaustion from frequent flying was a minor factor.§®  In the end, morale was the responsibility of military, not medical, men, but there were limits to what commanders could do. The objective, physical risk could be trimmed by provision of protective measures in flight and by better methods of rescue and rehabilitation for fallen fliers. Prompt replacement of lost crewmen was absolutely essential for morale—nothing was more depress- ing than empty bunks. Scarcely less important was a simple measure like keeping the mail flowing. In coping with anxiety, perhaps LeMay’s cheery fatalism was helpful to some. Certainly, as better commanders knew, crews responded badly to aborted or scrubbed missions: the heightening of anxiety to no purpose exacted a special strain. And commanders who failed to notify crews in advance of pending stand-downs, leaves, and passes ran the risk of reinforcing “a conception of higher authorities as remote, detached persons who were indifferent to the welfare of the men.” That conception could be more powerfully countered by a commander's willingness to share the danger, as LeMay did
