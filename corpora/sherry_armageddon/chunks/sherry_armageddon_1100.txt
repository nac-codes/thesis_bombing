204 of 368 47%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  Even for them, however, the emotional toll was exacting, and doctors who treated serious emotional problems among crewmen found themselves in “a wasteland in which to wander, filled with shadows of theories, dusty slogans, and dire predictions.” Lack of experience in the stresses of combat aviation was one problem. The flight surgeon also served clienteles with conflicting interests: the operational commander trying to increase missions, the combat crew needing protection from a comrade’s dangerous behavior, and the individual flier, who might underestimate his capacity to fly or, just as dangerous, overestimate that ability. The doctor’s uncertain middle course between these claims “was to help the men carry on to the limit of their capacity, and then perhaps fly a few more missions.” A punitive attitude toward emotional problems was widespread in the armed forces, but it was mitigated by the real affection of some commanders for their men and by the enormous investment the air force had in its flying personnel, who were too few and too expensive to be summarily cashiered. Moreover, although combat aviation offered peculiar stresses, cases of gross regression to infantile states were less common among airmen than among ground soldiers; the precarious task of flying, the fine motor and sensory skills it required, and the AAF’s superior psychiatric services led to earlier identification of severe problems.®  Still, for both flight surgeons and psychiatrists in rear areas treatment was always a struggle because of the unpredictable or intractable problems they confronted. The best doctors perceived keen limits on their predictive and curative abilities. Proud or frightened men masked symptoms adroitly; the triggers to anxiety and dysfunction were too multiple and environmental; and combat aviation, like other branches of service, did not always reward the “normal” or unconflicted personality.
