morale was the responsibility of military, not medical, men, but there were limits to what commanders could do. The objective, physical risk could be trimmed by provision of protective measures in flight and by better methods of rescue and rehabilitation for fallen fliers. Prompt replacement of lost crewmen was absolutely essential for morale—nothing was more depress- ing than empty bunks. Scarcely less important was a simple measure like keeping the mail flowing. In coping with anxiety, perhaps LeMay’s cheery fatalism was helpful to some. Certainly, as better commanders knew, crews responded badly to aborted or scrubbed missions: the heightening of anxiety to no purpose exacted a special strain. And commanders who failed to notify crews in advance of pending stand-downs, leaves, and passes ran the risk of reinforcing “a conception of higher authorities as remote, detached persons who were indifferent to the welfare of the men.” That conception could be more powerfully countered by a commander’s willingness to share the danger, as LeMay did. As psychiatrists commented, but good commanders have long known, “Nothing is worse for morale than a leader who leads from the rear,” particularly for American soldiers, whose lack of ideological and intellectual commitment to the war made their morale highly dependent on perceptions of equitably shared danger and group cohesiveness. So many officers died, some of considerable rank, that the lower ranks could not easily feel sacrificed to the ambitions of their superiors. Too, because combat commanders were not responsible for aircrews’ discipline on the ground, the petty frictions that often arose in the army between officers and enlisted men were rare in the combat air force.”°  But the manifold strains defeated some men. One Eighth Air Force tail gunner first encountered his dread on a training flight in England during which the bomb-bay door of another plane flew off and sliced away the tail section of his bomber.
