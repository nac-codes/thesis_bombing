hth Air Force tail gunner first encountered his dread on a training flight in England during which the bomb-bay door of another plane flew off and sliced away the tail section of his bomber. Trapped in the plummeting tail, the sergeant could not smash the Plexiglas but dug a hole in the metal skin, got his body out of the craft up to his shoulders, finally worked free, and got his parachute open shortly before hitting ground, uninjured. He landed near his crashed plane and, after a failed attempt to rescue his comrades, watched them burn. Insomnia and nightmares then set in, but he insisted on starting combat missions—it was the common pattern for crewmen to save up physical and emotional complaints until their tours of duty were nearly done. But when his bomber was damaged in combat, crew members detected that his strain was getting out of control and reported him to the doctors, who granted his wish to be grounded. His case compressed the multiple sources of strain for fliers: the role of blind chance (facing death even before going to battle), the loss of comrades, the cumulative impact of repeated missions, and the sense of helpless confinement. In the Eighth Air Force, only 2 percent of fliers suffered what the historian Thomas Coffey calls “nervous breakdowns,” but such a figure disguises a great deal: a host of lesser emotional disturbances, plus those expressed in or diagnosed as physical disabilities or disciplinary problems.”! In short, the damage could be staggering, both emotionally and physically, both in the air and on the ground where the bombs were dropped, and those who faced and witnessed it could not regard war simply as an application of technique distinct from kill- ing and destruction.  Yet the emotional mechanisms airmen used to cope with danger necessarily diminished their sensitivity to combat and destruction. They might become, commented air force psychiatrists, “effective, careful fighting men, quiet and cool on the ground and in the air”
