the center of their wartime concerns and postwar recollections. As public relations officer for the 21st Bomber Command in the Marianas, St. Clair McKelway noted that there was a “letdown” after operations started: “It would just be Big Business from now on, with military perfectionist standards applied all up and down the line until we had become an efficient, well-oiled machine of destruction—a good machine, maybe, but a dull one.” McKelway appreciated how much success was defined by efficient routine in which feelings about the enemy played a small role.78  Erich Fromm found airmen to be teams of technicians “not concerned with killing and... hardly aware of an enemy” and preoccupied “with the proper handling of their complicated machine along the lines laid down in meticulously organized plans.” Their destructiveness was “known to them cerebrally, but hardly comprehended affectively; it was, paradoxical as this may sound, none of their concern,” and the airmen, like the engineers of the bombing effort, were “completely alienated from the product of their work.” Fromm did not appreciate how quickly “meticulously organized plans” could collapse when men set out on a mission (or even before they did). His characterization may conflict with the liveliness evident in some firsthand observations of airmen’s personalities, which hardly always seemed dehumanized. But conditions acted to drain men of emotions about the enemy whatever their personalities. Guilt did arise for death meted out to victims below, appar- ently more often among bomber crews than among fighter pilots because the latter usually knew their attacks were confined to enemy soldiers. But by and large hatred and guilt involving the enemy were out of place in a war of technique or dwarfed by more immediate emotions, anxiety and the grief over loss of buddies.72  Distance from the enemy occurred because of the nature of air combat but even more because of demands of aviation that arose outside of combat.
