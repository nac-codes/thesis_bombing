men could smoke, eat, sleep, and wear regular clothing because the B-29 was pressurized and heated. Adding to the sense of unreality was the public relations policy of the Twentieth Air Force. Crews were “picking up news on their radios, when only halfway home, that their bombing mission had been announced in Washington. All the world knew about it, but they still had a thousand miles of ocean to cross before it was finished”—as if announcement of their attack were more important than their fate and missions had an abstracted reality apart from what men did.81  Grappling with the environment in and around the plane was as consuming as engaging the enemy. On the older bombers in service in Europe, cold and fatigue posed special problems. More men were disabled by frostbite than by combat wounds, especially when men came on board wet or sweaty or perspired heavily or urinated in their suits during the stress of combat. Anoxia from shortages of oxygen both compounded the perils of frostbite and posed a serious danger in and of itself.82 The men also had to cope with damage or malfunctions of the plane, often performing herculean feats to get a plane back to base, in the face of unpredictable changes in weather—an unexpected headwind, a target shrouded by bad weather, a home base sunny when they took off and socked in when they returned. Particularly in the Pacific, where the dominant weather patterns came through Japanese or Soviet territory from which American meteorologists could gain little infor-  Page 209 of 368 48%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON were out of place in a war of technique or dwarfed by more immediate emotions, anxiety and the grief over loss of buddies.72  Distance from the enemy occurred because of the nature of air combat but even more because of demands of aviation that arose outside of combat. Flying itself posed many of those demands, particularly for the men of the Twentieth Air Force, who were required to make roun
