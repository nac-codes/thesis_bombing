ut even more because of demands of aviation that arose outside of combat. Flying itself posed many of those demands, particularly for the men of the Twentieth Air Force, who were required to make round trips of up to four thousand miles, often across the treacherous heights of the Himalayas or the trackless expanses of the Pacific. On those missions, takeoff alone posed peril, for the planes were so heavily loaded with bombs and gasoline that the slightest mechanical or human failure could abort a mission or destroy a bomber. Then came the long flight whose success depended on the most careful calculations of altitude, speed, and fuel consumption. Even in October 1944, when the enemy’s air defenses were still formidable, LeMay’s crews operating out of China found that “take-off .. . is the high point of any flight. All crews, in discussing a mission, invariably talk about their take-off and not about flak, fighters, or other enemy opposition.” Likewise crews operating from the Marianas “began to fear their own aircraft and our field orders more than the devices of the enemy.” Ditching was frequent on B-29 flights of some fourteen hours, especially when winds of 150 miles sabotaged calculations of fuel consumption, and in the Pacific the downed flier was often never found and rescued. As Ernie Pyle reported, “They were over the empire for only twenty minutes to an hour. ... What gave the boys the willies was ‘sweating out’ those six or seven hours of ocean beneath them on the way back,” often at night. By the spring of 1945, crewmen in the B-29s faced greater risk from the hazards of flying than they did from the enemy, who accounted for only one-fifth of the B-29s downed. In those circumstances it was no wonder that the airmen Pyle talked with showed little strong feeling about the enemy.®2  Conditions within the bomber created a curious sense of unreality and alienation. On B-29s, a thirty-foot tunnel, just big enough to crawl through, was the only way to traverse
