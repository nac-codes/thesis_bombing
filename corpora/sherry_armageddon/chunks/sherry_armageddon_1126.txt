tory from which American meteorologists could gain little infor- mation, the unexpected often occurred.  In these conditions, the bomber often seemed more important than the enemy. It was the focus and repository of crewmen’s fears and hopes, the living creature who controlled their fate and whose fate they tried to control. Or it might become a projection of the flier. “He loves them [the planes] for their strength and beauty,” Dixon Wecter commented in 1944. “He looks upon them as ex- tensions of his ego, or friends whose temperaments are more vivid than those of most human beings he knows. ... A man begins to see his own personality in terms of the machines he loves.”23  Beyond the conditions of combat and flying, the airman’s life on the ground sustained his sense of distance from war and the enemy’s threat. By no means could all men boast, as one flier did to Pyle, that “we're living as good here [in the Marianas] as we did in America.” Facilities were often primitive when operations began. But airmen enjoyed more rest and comfort than did army soldiers or, in the case of airmen in England, the surrounding native population. Although men in the AAF bitterly complained that naval officers enjoyed scandalous luxuries, most airmen lived in comfortable, heated, often permanent buildings; they ate well, watched movies or slept for long periods between missions, or (in the Pacific) took a leisurely swim. Men in transit to or from combat assignments enjoyed the luxury of redistribution centers at Atlantic City and Miami Beach, the resorts taken over by the air force during the war. They also had the advantage of probably the best medical care of all the services. Given the enormous investment required to train aircrews, it made sense to treat them “with a high degree of indulgence,” to do everything to reduce deprivations that impeded morale. The high proportion of officers among combat airmen also insulated them from war's deprivations, for they “enjoyed the special
