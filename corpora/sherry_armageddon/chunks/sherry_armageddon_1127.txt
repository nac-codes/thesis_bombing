ndulgence,” to do everything to reduce deprivations that impeded morale. The high proportion of officers among combat airmen also insulated them from war's deprivations, for they “enjoyed the special privileges, the higher income and prestige that accrued to officers.” Even enlisted men in the air force received higher rank, more rapid promotions, and more awards and decorations than did their counterparts in the rest of the army. Operational circumstances also kept some of war’s uglier realities at distance: air bases were usually further behind the lines, less exposed to continuous danger than the bases from which ground soldiers operated.84  Airmen also spent more time away from combat assignments. They were in training longer before being sent to war; they were returned to the states or to noncombat duty after shorter overseas service than other men in the army; while stationed abroad, they had more free time away from the base and from military supervision. Of course, rhythms of combat varied enormously among different places and types of combat. Thus infantrymen and marines invading Japanese islands engaged in days or weeks of sustained combat while fliers returned to the relative security of bases, but ground soldiers often spent months behind the lines between assaults while aircrews continued flying missions every day or two. In Europe, the AAF bore the brunt of fighting until 1944, but ground operations, waged over large territories and long periods of time, lacked the episodic quality they often had in the Pacific. Even when placed in a battle situation, men might not actually fight; the army’s behavioral experts found that among ground soldiers only a small fraction fired their weapons in any given engagement, and by the same token combat airmen sometimes peeled off from engaging the enemy, dumped their bomb loads far from targets, or in other ways aborted their missions.®>  In any event, operational circumstances were perhaps not the primary ones condit
