eled off from engaging the enemy, dumped their bomb loads far from targets, or in other ways aborted their missions.®>  In any event, operational circumstances were perhaps not the primary ones conditioning airmen to see themselves as an elite for whom performance of professional skills—a mastery of technique—was more important than engaging an enemy. Before they went into combat and again when they came out of it, powerful factors of class, education, and policy strengthened their status and their elite image. The manner and sources of their recruitment were especially critical. Healthier, drawn from a higher educational and class base than other soldiers, given more specialized training, placed in combat duties only if they volunteered for them, airmen were regarded by themselves and others as “a piece of swank” or the “cream of the crop,” while the infantry was “a dumping ground.” As the war went on, it is true, the air force’s craving for manpower led it to draw in less advantaged men. Still, wartime stereotypes reflected both demographic realities and airmen’s self- image. They knew they possessed special prestige and deference, evident in the extraordinarily high ratio of officers to enlisted men and in the dominance of higher grades among the enlisted; in rank terms, the air force almost inverted the pyramid of the army. Awareness of prestige was enhanced by the favorable treatment, rapid promotion, and generous awards and decorations airmen received, and by the AAF’s success in public relations.8&  Page 209 of 368 48%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON ryle LepuLveu, Lilley WELE UVEL Ule ELILpILe LUL ULLLY LWELILY LLULES LU ail LOUL....
