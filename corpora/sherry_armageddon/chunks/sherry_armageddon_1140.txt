Shortages of permanent military personnel and facilities had led it, well before Pearl Harbor, to turn to civilian “contract” schools to provide primary training for pilots and other flying personnel as well as for many technical specialties. The AAF gradually took over or phased out most of the contract schools but not before thousands of pilots received their first instruction from civilians; other flying personnel were trained at institutions like the navigation school operated by Pan American Airways.
