tween femininity and that world. The instruments of destruction often had aggressive generic names such as Superfortresses or Marauders. A crew’s own bomber, however, was regarded less as an instrument of destruction than as the symbolic repository of feminine forces of unpredictable nature which men could not control. Crews often gave their bombers feminine names—Memphis Belle, Tokyo Rose, Enola Gay (after Paul Tibbetts’s mother)—and laced their sides with luridly colorful paintings of women until the air force banned “one of the last personal touches in an already impersonal war.” As with the scientists, the airmen’s rituals reflected more than the insecurities of a male psychology; they served many functions, not the least of which was the homely but powerful need to maintain symbolic contact with stateside sources of love and security. And in a culture that had made so much of aviation, the twin lures of potency and risk sometimes cut across gender lines. It was, after all, a woman flier who had once rhapsodized about “the feel of strength and power beneath your hands” and the quick “transition from life to death” in flying. Furthermore, hundreds of women flew military aircraft during the war, doing the sometimes fatal tasks of ferrying airplanes, towing targets, even testing rocket-propelled prototypes, and doing so without the lash of conscription, status as military personnel, and tangible benefits and payoff in the civilian marketplace accorded men.22  But if aviation did not meet only the needs of men, it remained largely a male sphere, and women (like black men) entered it only when the thirst for manpower impelled male leaders to open the door, only to close it again when a surplus of male crews became available late in the war. Likewise, if aviation did not always appeal to masculine ambitions, the testimony to how often it did suggests that airmen, like some scientists, achieved mastery of the natural world by risking return to it—they conquered death b
