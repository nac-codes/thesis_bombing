Technological zeal differed from political zeal, but it too had a political content, if one not so easily recognized. Indeed, the “political sterility” they observed, accompanied by technological prowess, could be a frightening combination.  The Sources of Technological Fanaticism  THE DISTANT COMMAND  After November 1942, Lieutenant General Henry Harley Arnold ran the Army Air Forces from his office in the new Pentagon building. This labyrinthine structure, with its “narrow stairways that seemed to end in No Exit passageways suitable for disappearances of Alice’s white rabbit,” quickly came to symbolize the centralization of American military power. Whereas countless bureaus and commands previously had been scattered all about the Washington area, ““The Pentagon thinks’ and ‘The Pentagon says’ soon became familiar in by-lined stories and ‘inside’ columns.”  In time, and with reason, the Pentagon came to stand for something else. Its confusion of corridors and commands also evoked a bureaucratic maze in which power swirled about in ways that baffled even insiders.
