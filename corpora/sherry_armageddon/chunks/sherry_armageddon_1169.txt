Marshall had moved the Joint Chiefs to a firm statement of expectations to invade Japan, thereby shaping air strategy insofar as it would have to assist invasion. Thereafter, the Joint Chiefs’ meetings, and with them their review of strategy, declined sharply, in part because the strategic course of the war now seemed set.  Like his superiors, Marshall was kept abreast of progress in the air war. But especially with regard to the Pacific, Marshall rarely exercised his formal authority over Arnold and the air force. The AAF staff kept him informed more as a matter of courtesy, and with the expectation of “solidifying the position of the 20th Air Force within the War Department” by notifying Marshall of its triumphs.* Now that Arnold was surrounded by some talented staff—notably Brigadier (later Major) General Laurence Kuter and Brigadier (later Major) General Lauris Norstad—Marshall was less inclined to scrutinize the AAF’s performance. Furthermore, reorganizations of the JCS committee system and the War Department staff had increasingly enabled the air staff to bypass the army staff structure and deal directly with the Joint Chiefs. Functionally, if not yet legally, the AAF was independent of the army and the bureaucratic equal to it in many ways.  Ifthe supervision given Arnold and the air force was loose, it was hardly understood they would go their own way. Marshall had earlier decided to make Arnold “as nearly as I could Chief of Staff of the Air without any restraint,” but he added that Arnold “was very subordinate,” and indeed their relationship would have been impossible had the two not been in substantial agreement on most strategic issues.© Arnold was simply free to direct the air war within a strategic context shared broadly by his president and his military superiors. After September 1944, no one outside the air force carefully examined its methods of bombing. Whether it chose to blast factories, mine sea-lanes, or level cities was largely for Arnold and
