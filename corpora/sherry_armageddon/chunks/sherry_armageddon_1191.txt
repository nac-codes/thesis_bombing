ainst Japan ever had. The committee implicitly placed “urban industrial areas” below merchant shipping and the steel industry and above the aircraft industry in its priorities. More important, it gathered what became commonplace arguments for attacking Japanese cities by fire: the great concentration of Japanese industry in a few cities, the practice of subcontracting to small domestic producers, and the peculiar vulnerability of those cities to fires. If delivered on target, a few thousand tons of incendiaries, a fraction of the total weight of bombs envisaged for the campaign against Japan, would destroy the cen- tral areas of twenty cities, so the committee argued.  It was a telling admission that “the greater number of the more important industrial plants lie outside the specific areas suggested for incendiary attack.” But those plants would supposedly be taken care of by precision attacks, and more diffuse economic damage would be inflicted by the destruction of subcontractors, “the dislocation of labor by casualty, homelessness and forced migration,”  Page 224 of 368 51%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  We AR Ce Re Uk Ae ane CER neat BRR RU UE JPR CRC A Uk MERE ee Ea ae RU POP pana eek Uk Cee Cee He OUR Cas ceee e teaany  months until “a number of bat bombs, blown out of the target area by high winds, burned down a theater, the officers’ club, and a general’s sedan at Carlsbad [New Mexico] Army Air Field.” Other impractical but prophetic ideas flowed from the Chemical Warfare Service—experiments in showering incendiary “leaves” over forests and grainfields, an early exercise in the arts of defoliation. In the bizarre, Japan sometimes matched the United States, as in its hapless effort to rain balloon-bombs on the United States.15  The major preoccupation of the American chemists was the development of reliable incendiaries to be dropped by aircraft against enemy cities. Much effort was necessary to produce bombs which did not disint
