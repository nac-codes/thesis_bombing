incendiary war attracted sustained approval. It was supported by British planners and by the prime minister himself, who in May spoke to the American Congress of “the process, so necessary and desirable, of laying the cities and other munitions centres of Japan in ashes, for in ashes they must surely lie before peace comes back to the world.” In Arnold’s Committee of Operations Analysts (COA), military members compromised long-standing air force doctrine to press for incendiary bombing, while Guido Perera, the lawyer and leading civilian member, “felt it was wrong for the Air Force to turn from precision bombing to area attacks.” As “a cynic might add—it is worse than immoral because it is ineffective.” So he recalled in his memoirs at least, but little trace of his doubts or of any discernible difference between civilians and professional officers on firebombing survived among contemporary records.18  Indeed, in 1943 much of the impetus behind firebombing came from another civilian, Horatio Bond, consultant to the National Defense Research Committee and chief engineer of the National Fire Protection Association, who was later joined by colleagues from that organization and from the Safety Research Institute. Fire fighters—or fire protection engineers, as they preferred to call themselves—proved to be eager fire starters. Like many another civilian profession, their only regret was that they had not “been given an earlier voice in certain major decisions of the war.”!® Late in 1944, more high-powered civilian scientists joined the cause of war by fire.  Meanwhile, by November 1943, the COA had produced for Arnold its report entitled “Economic Objectives in the Far East,” as much of a blueprint as the air war against Japan ever had. The committee implicitly placed “urban industrial areas” below merchant shipping and the steel industry and above the aircraft industry in its priorities. More important, it gathered what became commonplace arguments for attacking Japane
