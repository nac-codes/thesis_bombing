n industrial areas” below merchant shipping and the steel industry and above the aircraft industry in its priorities. More important, it gathered what became commonplace arguments for attacking Japanese cities by fire: the great concentration of Japanese industry in a few cities, the practice of subcontracting to small domestic producers, and the peculiar vulnerability of those cities to fires. If delivered on target, a few thousand tons of incendiaries, a fraction of the total weight of bombs envisaged for the campaign against Japan, would destroy the cen- tral areas of twenty cities, so the committee argued.  It was a telling admission that “the greater number of the more important industrial plants lie outside the specific areas suggested for incendiary attack.” But those plants would supposedly be taken care of by precision attacks, and more diffuse economic damage would be inflicted by the destruction of subcontractors, “the dislocation of labor by casualty, homelessness and forced migration,” the shattering of morale, and the disruption of economic and administrative machinery. “Uncontrollable conflagrations” would “constitute a major disaster” for the enemy. The committee made no estimate of enemy casualties, preferring to measure the damage with other statistics—180 square miles of urban areas devastated, and 12 million people, or 70 percent of the total population in the twenty cities, rendered “homeless.”2°  The section of the committee report dealing with incendiary attacks was quite brief considering the importance it attached to them and which they would come to play. Brevity measured the ease of this kind of bombing from the planners’ perspective. Attack on specific economic objectives like shipping or the steel industry required extended scrutiny of complex economic considerations and the most elaborate photographic surveillance and analysis. Incendiary attacks required only some general assumptions about the nature of the Japanese economy, easy photo
