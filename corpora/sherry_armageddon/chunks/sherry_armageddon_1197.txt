eMay’s interest, supported by Arnold from Washington, and reinforced by the powerful British demonstration at Hamburg—accelerated rapidly during 1944. Still, until the last months of the European war, they were only a small part of the American aerial arsenal and were em- ployed largely against German industrial targets.17  Interest in firebombing Japanese cities crystalized earlier and more intensely. Initial studies by the air force staff had emphasized the classic precepts of high-explosive bombing of precision targets, but by 1943 incendiary war attracted sustained approval. It was supported by British planners and by the prime minister himself, who in May spoke to the American Congress of “the process, so necessary and desirable, of laying the cities and other munitions centres of Japan in ashes, for in ashes they must surely lie before peace comes back to the world.” In Arnold’s Committee of Operations Analysts (COA), military members compromised long-standing air force doctrine to press for incendiary bombing, while Guido Perera, the lawyer and leading civilian member, “felt it was wrong for the Air Force to turn from precision bombing to area attacks.” As “a cynic might add—it is worse than immoral because it is ineffective.” So he recalled in his memoirs at least, but little trace of his doubts or of any discernible difference between civilians and professional officers on firebombing survived among contemporary records.18  Indeed, in 1943 much of the impetus behind firebombing came from another civilian, Horatio Bond, consultant to the National Defense Research Committee and chief engineer of the National Fire Protection Association, who was later joined by colleagues from that organization and from the Safety Research Institute. Fire fighters—or fire protection engineers, as they preferred to call themselves—proved to be eager fire starters. Like many another civilian profession, their only regret was that they had not “been given an earlier voice in cert
