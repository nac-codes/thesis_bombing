Arnold, to whom none of O’Donnell’s arguments was new, re- plied that Japan’s aircraft industry would have to enjoy first priority.2°  Arnald wrac alurave flavihle hauraver He had reneatedly avnracced interact in incendiary attacke and he wac eager tn on ahead with avnarimants raeammended hw hic aneratinne analyvete The  Page 226 of 368 52%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON twenty cities, rendered “homeless.”2°  The section of the committee report dealing with incendiary attacks was quite brief considering the importance it attached to them and which they would come to play. Brevity measured the ease of this kind of bombing from the planners’ perspective. Attack on specific economic objectives like shipping or the steel industry required extended scrutiny of complex economic considerations and the most elaborate photographic surveillance and analysis. Incendiary attacks required only some general assumptions about the nature of the Japanese economy, easy photographic surveys to determine broad areas with dense workers’ housing, and the assignment of requisite tonnages. Outside the air force, a few voices offered caution in 1943. The flimsiness of Japanese cities making their destruction so easy also would make their rebuilding “correspondingly simple,” argued a State Department expert on Japan, while other officials worried that “the untold destruction” unleashed by incendiaries “would unite the mass of people more closely.” But the operations analysts were not examining the politics of surrender, and the destruction they envisioned seemed too extensive to worry about potential for recovery.2!  After November, the technicians’ work went forward, as they revised sharply upward the tonnage requirements for incendiary raids.22 The high command was preoccupied for months with other matters, but in May 1944, as the Twentieth Air Force prepared fo
