as they revised sharply upward the tonnage requirements for incendiary raids.22 The high command was preoccupied for months with other matters, but in May 1944, as the Twentieth Air Force prepared for its first attacks, the issue of incendiary bombing resurfaced. On the ninth, Perera recommended that the incendiary campaign begin in March 1945, when wind and weather conditions would maximize its effect. At the same time, chemical and biological warfare again came in for high-level attention.22  Before June, the firebombing of Japan had been debated in an operational vacuum. It gained new urgency once the B-29s began flying. Operational considerations plunged the air staff into protracted debate. The ineffectiveness of the Twentieth’s early precision raids from China bases was quickly evident, and on August 8 one of the wing commanders due to bomb Japan from the Mari- anas pointedly raised the issue of bombing strategy with Arnold. Brigadier General Rosie O’Donnell argued that no small force of B-29s could achieve decisive effects on industrial targets: “Steam roller tactics are not applicable out there because while we have the steam, we have no rollers.” O'Donnell strongly urged downgrading precision attacks for the moment and instead sending the bombers “singly at night using radar to destroy and burn down the several large cosmopolitan centers” and “thereby striking a tremendous blow at civilian morale.” Particularly since most Japanese cities were, like Hamburg, in coastal areas, they seemed “ideal radar targets.”24  O’Donnell’s argument ran up against the hold that precision bombing still had on some of the staff of the Twentieth, especially Hansell. The B-29 itself had been designed with daylight operations in mind. O’Donnell’s recommendation conflicted also with prevailing conceptions of operational need. Researchers had already pointed out that small-scale incendiary raids would be counterproductive, for if they burned out small portions of cities, they wou
