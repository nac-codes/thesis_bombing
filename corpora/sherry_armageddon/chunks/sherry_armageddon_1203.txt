prevailing conceptions of operational need. Researchers had already pointed out that small-scale incendiary raids would be counterproductive, for if they burned out small portions of cities, they would only make full-scale conflagrations harder to ignite; better to wait for attacks in force. Furthermore, the air war against Germany had deeply discouraged the air staff about the chances of waging a strategic campaign before destroying the enemy’s air force. Arnold, to whom none of O’Donnell’s arguments was new, re- plied that Japan’s aircraft industry would have to enjoy first priority.25  Arnold was always flexible however. He had repeatedly expressed interest in incendiary attacks, and he was eager to go ahead with experiments recommended by his operations analysts. The tests they proposed would have no immediate military utility—targets were chosen “for their compactness and combustibility rather than for their economic or strategic importance.” But test raids would refine calculations on the weight, density, and timing of incendiary attacks. Accordingly, twenty-four B-29s struck Nagasaki on the night of August 10-11, although neither LeMay nor much of his staff was yet eager to give incendiary raids a high priority.2®  Staff officers and operations researchers continued to press the case for incendiary attacks, first experimental, then comprehensive. A September 4 report by aCOA subcommittee acknowledged that full-scale attacks on six large urban areas would not likely “affect front line strength.” But there was satisfaction in another projected measurement: the attacks “will produce very great economic loss, measured in man months of industrial labor—probably greater loss per ton of bombs despatched than attacks on any other target system.” Damage to industry would merely be a welcome side effect of the general dislocation caused by the “dehousing” of some 7,750,000 workers and the evacuation of many more. The report was a rarity in that it explicitly made an e
