merely be a welcome side effect of the general dislocation caused by the “dehousing” of some 7,750,000 workers and the evacuation of many more. The report was a rarity in that it explicitly made an estimate of probable enemy casualties, extrapolating its figures from the great Tokyo fire of 1923: some 560,000 Japanese, almost half in Tokyo, would be killed, missing, or seriously wounded. Otherwise, in applying their skills as economists and lawyers, the experts usually measured the effects of bombing by the statistics and language of cost-benefit analysis.27  When the full committee issued revised guidelines in October (omitting any mention of casualties), it recommended an incendiary assault on Japan’s cities to come after a precision campaign, when a sufficiently large force of bombers had been assembled to permit highly concentrated fire raids. As usual, the analysts made no attempt to project how such raids would help secure final vic- tory, simply implying their relationship to victory. Shortly thereafter the newly formed Joint Target Group, a Joint Chiefs of Staff agency, gave qualified approval to the COA report.28  At the same time, in another indication of civilian interest in incendiary war, Vannevar Bush forwarded to Arnold the recommendations of an operations researcher on his staff at the Office of Scientific Research and Development. Incendiary bombing, it was argued,  may be the golden opportunity of strategic bombardment in this war—and possibly one of the outstanding opportunities in all history to do the greatest damage... for a minimum of effort. Estimates of economic damage expected indicate that incendiary attack of Japanese cities may be at least five times as effective, ton for ton, as precision bombing of selected strategic targets as practiced in the European theater. However, the dry economic statistics, impressive as they may be, still do not take account of the further and unpredictable effect on the Japanese war effort of a national cat
