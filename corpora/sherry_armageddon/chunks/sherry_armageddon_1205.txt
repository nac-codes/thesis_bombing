However, the dry economic statistics, impressive as they may be, still do not take account of the further and unpredictable effect on the Japanese war effort of a national catastrophe of such magni- tude—entirely unprecedented in history.  Still, “dry economic statistics” were what the analyst had to offer, again leaving the impression that “the greatest damage to the enemy for a minimum of effort” had become a goal apart from victory, in part because it was more easily measurable. Bush recognized that the issue of incendiary bombing involved “humanitarian aspects” for which a decision “will have to be made at a high level if it has not been done already.” Nothing came of his recommendation, no doubt because the air force believed it had already received sufficient sanction from the president.22  Indeed by September, even as the analysts’ reports were still coming in, the air staff apparently had committed itself to a major incendiary campaign the following spring. As was often the case, no pronouncement to that effect came from Arnold’s headquarters.

The shift in emphasis may have been hastened by the replacement on August 20 of Hansell (off to the Marianas) as the Twentieth’s chief of staff with Norstad, an eager advocate of incendiaries and a recipient of a new team of fire engineers pressing the case for firebombing.22  Page 227 of 368 52%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  Satna eee atten ep Meee Chee neta Creme precision Sylioila 9 Nae RA Ca eR Uk Cee WO Ve Rhee oe eae CUP CRE ERY RARE ae Bee Oe Rae te Cae eee eaten My eee  operations in mind. O’Donnell’s recommendation conflicted also with prevailing conceptions of operational need. Researchers had already pointed out that small-scale incendiary raids would b
