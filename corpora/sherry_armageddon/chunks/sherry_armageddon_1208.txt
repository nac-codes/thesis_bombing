ve, ton for ton, as precision bombing of selected strategic targets as practiced in the European theater. However, the dry economic statistics, impressive as they may be, still do not take account of the further and unpredictable effect on the Japanese war effort of a national catastrophe of such magni- tude—entirely unprecedented in history.  Still, “dry economic statistics” were what the analyst had to offer, again leaving the impression that “the greatest damage to the enemy for a minimum of effort” had become a goal apart from victory, in part because it was more easily measurable. Bush recognized that the issue of incendiary bombing involved “humanitarian aspects” for which a decision “will have to be made at a high level if it has not been done already.” Nothing came of his recommendation, no doubt because the air force believed it had already received sufficient sanction from the president.22  Indeed by September, even as the analysts’ reports were still coming in, the air staff apparently had committed itself to a major incendiary campaign the following spring. As was often the case, no pronouncement to that effect came from Arnold’s headquarters. Rather, the commitment was evident in the increased flow of communications on the subject among the Washington staff and the pressure on field commanders to prepare further tests against Japanese cities. The shift in emphasis may have been hastened by the replacement on August 20 of Hansell (off to the Marianas) as the Twentieth’s chief of staff with Norstad, an eager advocate of incendiaries and a recipient of a new team of fire engineers pressing the case for firebombing.22  No decision would have been made without Arnold’s approval, however, and doubtless the arguments of the operations researchers helped end his vacillation about whether to resort to incendiaries. At bottom, these arguments dressed up Arnold’s relentless emphasis on maximum effort in the fancier language of cost-benefit studies and statistical
