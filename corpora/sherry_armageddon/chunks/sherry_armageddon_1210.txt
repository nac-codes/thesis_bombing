High explosives could be mixed with “a large percentage of Napalm incendiary clusters” to help in “dislocating workers.” As usual, strategic consequences were drawn from operational considerations but were not dictated by them: they merely led the air force where it was already inclined to go.33  To be sure, strategy remained in flux, contested by various bureaucratic interests and buffetted by changing assessments of progress in the war.

The report was a rarity in that it explicitly made an estimate of probable enemy casualties, extrapolating its figures from
