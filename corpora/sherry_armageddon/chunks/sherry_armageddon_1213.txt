language of cost-benefit studies and statistical measurements. Arnold had always been inclined to measure effort in quantitative terms, focusing on weight applied and damage done without pressing their connection to victory. To a man of that mentality, elaborate statistics pro- jecting rubble accumulated and man-hours lost on a per ton basis were attractive, all the more so since they were endowed with the aura of scientific expertise.31  Furthermore, his closest scientific advisor, Edward L. Bowles, was now weighing in with similar arguments, ones developed by the Special Bombardment Group, a new committee of experts set up by Bowles and drawn from the air staff, the scientific and engineering community, and the aviation industry. Their task was to promote the bombing of Japan “by techniques known to us but not yet fully explored or in use,” such as unmanned bombers remotely controlled by radar and television to zero them in on targets.32  Citing the urgency of increasing the bomb tonnage dropped, the Bowles group argued for stripping the B-29s of most of their defensive armament to permit a vastly increased bomb load. The risk to the bombers was minimal, the experts argued, because the defensive gunnery was not working well in practice and the increased speed made possible in part by streamlining the bombers’ surfaces would enable them to outrun “even the best experimental Japanese fighter.” The recommendation elicited a vigorous rebuttal from other operations analysts; it must have come as a shock to the airmen and to General Electric engineers who had designed the B-29’s novel centralized fire control by which several guns aboard ship were remotely controlled from a single position. Nonetheless, Arnold (and later LeMay) were open to the proposal, and although Bowles disavowed any intention to meddle in strategy, his staff recognized the strategic implications: defenseless bombers would operate more safely at night, relying on radar techniques which would virtua
