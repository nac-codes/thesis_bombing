s disavowed any intention to meddle in strategy, his staff recognized the strategic implications: defenseless bombers would operate more safely at night, relying on radar techniques which would virtually compel the resort to area, incendiary bombing. High explosives could be mixed with “a large percentage of Napalm incendiary clusters” to help in “dislocating workers.” As usual, strategic consequences were drawn from operational considerations but were not dictated by them: they merely led the air force where it was already inclined to go.32  To be sure, strategy remained in flux, contested by various bureaucratic interests and buffetted by changing assessments of progress in the war. The possibility of assigning top priority to Japanese shipping was raised again in the fall by a COA subcommittee and by Robert Patterson, the War Department’s under secretary. The air staff replied with a rhetorical salute to the importance of attacking shipping followed by reaffirmation of its priority on the aircraft industry and urban areas. It was not about to resort to “another hope for a relatively painless method of winning the war,” as one official derisively characterized the shipping plan.*4  In truth, while the AAF would eventually mount an effective effort at aerial mining, it never had its heart in a campaign it saw as largely the navy’s responsibility, which might even imply subordination to the navy’s control and which lacked the glamor and directness of an assault on Japan proper. Furthermore, injunctions from the Joint Chiefs to prepare Japan for quick invasion diminished interest in an operation which “would be of interest if we were thinking in terms of a two year’s reduction of the Japanese homeland.” In an unrecognized irony of the moment, heightened expectations of invasion aggravated the impatience to get on with the destruction of Japan’s cities, rather than comprising an alternative to strategic devastation. The air force never denied the efficacy of a mining
