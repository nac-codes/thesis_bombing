nvasion aggravated the impatience to get on with the destruction of Japan’s cities, rather than comprising an alternative to strategic devastation. The air force never denied the efficacy of a mining campaign. It simply lacked the patience, and saw it nowhere else, to give it a try.35  In November, as pressure to conduct further incendiary tests mounted, air officers increasingly mimicked the language of the civilian analysts: “Dehousing industrial workers causes a greater loss of man hours per ton of bombs dropped than can be accomplished by any other method.” “Dehousing” was becoming the favorite euphemism for a variety of virtues perceived in an incendiary assault, some spelled out—workers’ absenteeism, lower morale, paralyzed systems—some usually left unspoken: the maimed bodies and bewildering toll of the dead. Target analysts recognized that  minh. ances Te eieneel dd tn Aint annnt Ann nn An net cere itn eee 2d Ie Ase nba] natn inbew ant Dest Laces aera ntinn nd than wnenl Ae testa ain etn dae Af 4b nlan nnd wn enninn One a cirnelend eenere Lone d tn  Page 229 of 368 52%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  Citing the urgency of increasing the bomb tonnage dropped, the Bowles group argued for stripping the B-29s of most of their defensive armament to permit a vastly increased bomb load. The risk to the bombers was minimal, the experts argued, because the defensive gunnery was not working well in practice and the increased speed made possible in part by streamlining the bombers’ surfaces would enable them to outrun “even the best experimental Japanese fighter.” The recommendation elicited a vigorous rebuttal from other operations analysts; it must have come as a shock to the airmen and to General Electric engineers who had designed the B-29’s novel centralized fire control by which several guns aboard ship were remotely controlled from a single position. Nonetheless, Arnold (and later LeMay) were open to the proposal, and although Bowles
