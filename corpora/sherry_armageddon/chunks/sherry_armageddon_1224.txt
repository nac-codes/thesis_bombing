academic, nonpractical attitude which has plagued and beclouded the role of the bomber as a modern weapon of war.” The experts seemed far too intent on winning the war by “finding pink pill, Holy Grail targets.” Such criticism could easily spill over into diatribes suggesting there was little to do except bomb on: if, as the experts suggested, the lack of data on bombing’s effectiveness was “a regrettable state of affairs,” then airmen reported that “so is the war. ... So, in short, is the fact that we’re fighting a somewhat complicated war instead of engaging in a research project for the next one.”4! The insight here—that war cannot be neatly planned—was more often appreciated by military men than by civilian analysts; it also implied too easy a capitulation to war’s unpredictability, a lack of concern about limiting its waste.  In the end, not surprisingly, military commanders often made critical decisions by seat-of-the-pants methods, oblivious to the expert analyses. For all the specialists in photographic analysis had refined their techniques, Harris still made “judgements from his own interpretations of the photographs on his desk.”42 Arnold proceeded less imperiously, but he also rarely encountered expert advice conflicting with his own predispositions. The talent gathering around the American and British air forces (some four hundred operations analysts, mostly civilian, in the AAF)4? in the end ap- parently made little difference in the choices made of strategies and means; much of the expert effort simply provided a quasi-scientific rationale for what the bomber commanders would do anyway.  Yet in a subtle way the civilian experts did make a difference. They did much to refine the means of waging air war by settling straightforward problems of the design of bombs, their distribution over targets, the choice of bombing techniques in different circumstances, and so forth. It was indirectly, through their work in refining those means, that they affected str
