most reducible to quantification also received the closest scrutiny, thereby attracting the greatest investment and the most refined justification.  By one standard, this characterization suggests the indifference of scientists and statisticians to strategic purposes and their immersion into the technique of war. Their mentality was not the one so often ascribed to American war-makers, an exclusive focus on victory, but the pursuit of destruction without a clear notion of its relationship to victory. In another sense, however, ends were  Page 232 of 368 53%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  Bree eee be SE Sp et bald, he ne Re ne ogg haat, en Rone Bo a en ng ee en Se ge ee ne eon ee ny, i Se ae ey Ly on  fact that we're fighting a somewhat complicated war instead of engaging in a research project for the next one.”41 The insight here—that war cannot be neatly planned—was more often appreciated by military men than by civilian analysts; it also implied too easy a capitulation to war’s unpredictability, a lack of concern about limiting its waste.  In the end, not surprisingly, military commanders often made critical decisions by seat-of-the-pants methods, oblivious to the expert analyses. For all the specialists in photographic analysis had refined their techniques, Harris still made “judgements from his own interpretations of the photographs on his desk.”42 Arnold proceeded less imperiously, but he also rarely encountered expert advice conflicting with his own predispositions. The talent gathering around the American and British air forces (some four hundred operations analysts, mostly civilian, in the AAF)*? in the end ap- parently made little difference in the choices made of strategies and means; much of the expert effort simply provided a quasi-scientific rationale for what the bomber commanders would do anyway.  Yet in a subtle way the civilian experts did make a difference. They did much to refine the means of waging air war by settlin
