n occasion; dehumanized language alone did not compel men to kill and destroy on the scale they did. But, reinforced by other forms of distance characteristic of the air war, it did allow them to do so while insulating their consciences and souls. And by doing so, it helped to push victory from view and to elevate destruction into a goal. “To all sides in a conflict,” Zuckerman has commented, “the goal of war must always be victory, but victory has over the course of history almost always been associated with destruction, so much so that de- struction has become a kind of vested characteristic of war.”45 The application of operations research to war, at least as practiced in 1944, was one source of that tendency.  That application should not be blamed solely on the scientists who were coming into power. The urge to quantify was also related to the airman’s eagerness to intensify operations and to the difficulties inherent in air war of measuring effects by any but numerical methods. Moreover, many of the operations researchers were not scientists. The language and standards of measurement they employed were often borrowed not from science but from the balance sheet mentality of capitalism. The effort to construct a profit-and-loss statement of air war reflected a belief that entrepreneur- ial models were appropriate to war.  In the end, one is unsure whether to be impressed by the sophistication evident in viewing Japan as a vast laboratory in destruction or appalled by the naivete and narrowness of what these experts did. For all the weight of intelligence brought to bear on the bombing effort, it was still possible for one analyst, as late as June 6, 1945, to complain that “unfortunately, there has been to date no careful study of bombing accuracy from B-29’s.”4° The failure to do something so simple and critical to an evaluation of success suggests how the application of expertise served to make the mo- mentum of destruction more thoughtless than refined.
