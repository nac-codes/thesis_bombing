an war-makers, an exclusive focus on victory, but the pursuit of destruction without a clear notion of its relationship to victory. In another sense, however, ends were not so much abandoned as redefined. For these men, perfecting the technique of war became an end in itself, one that encompassed important goals: professional satisfaction and achievement and air force ambitions for a technology and a war-making record that would enhance its place in the postwar military establishment.  The rhetoric and methodology of civilian expertise also defined goals by the distance they interposed between the designers and victims of destruction. The more sophisticated the methods of destruction became, the less language and methods of measurement allowed men to acknowledge the nature of that destruction. A dehumanized rhetoric of technique reduced the enemy to quan- tifiable abstractions. Statistics of man-hours lost and workers dehoused objectified many of the enemy’s experiences and banished almost altogether one category, his death. Certainly Arnold, LeMay, and Harris were brutally frank in their vocabulary on occasion; dehumanized language alone did not compel men to kill and destroy on the scale they did. But, reinforced by other forms of distance characteristic of the air war, it did allow them to do so while insulating their consciences and souls. And by doing so, it helped to push victory from view and to elevate destruction into a goal. “To all sides in a conflict,” Zuckerman has commented, “the goal of war must always be victory, but victory has over the course of history almost always been associated with destruction, so much so that de- struction has become a kind of vested characteristic of war.”4° The application of operations research to war, at least as practiced in 1944, was one source of that tendency.  That application should not be blamed solely on the scientists who were coming into power. The urge to quantify was also related to the airman’s eagerness to
