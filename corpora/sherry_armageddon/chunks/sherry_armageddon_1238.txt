difficulty in reducing decisions about war to systematic formulas. It also reflected the fact that the ex- perts did not see their job to be one of connecting the refinement of means to the pursuit of ends—to a concept of how victory was to be achieved.  It was better to bomb well than badly, as Freeman Dyson once thought of the American effort against Japan.48 In many ways, the talent available to the AAF helped it to do so. Yet, ata minimum, virtue inhered in a better method of bombing only if it related to the ultimate goal of victory. Even if bombing’s ability to win the war could be firmly established, other moral considerations come into play: the humanitarian concerns raised by Bush; the possibility of alternative means that might accomplish the same goal with less bloodshed; the consequences after victory of introducing an especially fearsome method of war. It might, indeed, not be better to bomb well, not if to do so only piled on redundant destruction. Because civilian experts usually avoided looking into the abyss of these issues, they became by default the responsibility of strategists and commanders in uniform, insofar as they were recognized at all.  THE FAILURE OF STRATEGY  By September 1944, strategy for the defeat of Japan had been given a broad formulation which was to remain substantially undisturbed till the last months of the war. As expressed by the Combined Chiefs of Staff, the Allies were “to force the unconditional surrender of Japan by... invading and seizing objectives in the industrial heart of Japan” after a campaign of blockade by air and sea; “intensive air bombardment” was designed to lower the enemy’s ability and will to resist.42 Strategic bombing was to play a role complementary to other campaigns, independent in its command and target ob- jectives but harnessed to the ultimate task of invasion and occupation.  The origins of that strategy lay in both American military traditions and the circumstances of the moment. A “strategy of
