t ob- jectives but harnessed to the ultimate task of invasion and occupation.  The origins of that strategy lay in both American military traditions and the circumstances of the moment. A “strategy of annihilation” aimed at engaging the enemy’s main forces and seizing his territory and capital had deep roots in the American style of warfare, especially as it had developed since I1860.*° The Allied policy of unconditional surrender reflected that strategic tradition as well as the requirements of alliance politics and the ideological nature of the war. Dashing hopes for early victory in Europe, the tenacity of German resistance through the fall and winter of 1944 sug- gested anew the impossibility of securing unconditional surrender without a fight to the finish. The abundance of resources amassed by the Allies made such a fight possible.  The definition of Allied strategy, along with the vagueness about its details, complicated the task of airmen in articulating a rationale for the bombing of Japan. Some airmen still hoped to force Japan’s capitulation through blockade and bombardment alone, and there had been evidence in Roosevelt’s own statements and in the media to indicate political support for such a strategy.

Yet, ata minimum, virtue inhered in a better method of bombing only if it related to the ultimate goal of victory. Even if bombing’s ability to win the war could be firmly established, other moral considerations come into play: the humanitarian concerns raised by Bush; the possibility of alternative means that might accomplish the same goal with less bloodshed; the consequences after victory of
