considerations come into play: the humanitarian concerns raised by Bush; the possibility of alternative means that might accomplish the same goal with less bloodshed; the consequences after victory of introducing an especially fearsome method of war. It might, indeed, not be better to bomb well, not if to do so only piled on redundant destruction. Because civilian experts usually avoided looking into the abyss of these issues, they became by default the responsibility of strategists and commanders in uniform, insofar as they were recognized at all.

The abundance of resources amassed by the Allies made su
