he two services had long bred a bitter rivalry. Arnold owed to Marshall too much of his authority over the air force to desert his patron and forge a link with Admiral King. More than these political considerations, little in the mood at the time encouraged making choices between strategies for victory. Marshall, it is true, had raised pointed questions on September 1 about the timing and relationship between invasion and aerial assault of the home islands. On September 5, Admiral Leahy, in a rare thrust into grand strategy, had asked the vital question of whether to proceed against Japan by land invasion or by sea and air blockade—he preferred the latter method as likely to “require a longer time to bring the war to an end, but with less cost to us in life and material.” The Joint Chiefs even seemed to agree that so fundamental a decision could be made only by the president himself, but it never came before the presi- dent until June of the next year, with a very different man in office.54  Most of the time, the high command did not ask which strategy would be the most efficient way to secure victory, but rather how all strategies could be assembled and applied against the enemy. The tenacity of enemy resistance did not seem to permit, any more than the weight of Allied resources seemed to require, a selective use of force against Japan. There was no official sanction for seeing bombing as an alternative to invasion. The engines of war would have to roll on; the problem was how to fuel them, not which ones to run. Command relationships also discouraged refined speculation. With no centralized command in the Pacific war, the selection of strategic alternatives was up to the Joint and Combined Chiefs. The former generally made hard choices only under dur- ess or when the commander in chief directed them to do so; the latter was an ineffective mechanism because the British role in Far Eastern strategy was minimal.  As did other failures of command in the air war, the
