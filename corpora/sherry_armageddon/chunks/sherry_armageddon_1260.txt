They curried the impression that Japan now supported genuine independence among its subject peoples and might also welcome an important role for the Western powers in postwar Asia. Put another way, these Japanese leaders were preparing a public to accept defeat “by calling it a victory for certain universalistic principles.”*  Some Americans, at least hazily aware of this reorientation, hoped to exploit it by clarifying and perhaps moderating the formula for unconditional surrender first spelled out by Roosevelt and Churchill in January 1943. Officials in both the State Department and the services wondered how to apply that formula to Japan in a way promoting an early termination of the war and long- term American interests in Asia. To be sure, other military officers, echoing the popular view set forth by de Seversky, argued that vengeance was the nation’s purpose: the Japanese were simply “international bandits,” and their country “should be bombed so that there was little left of its civilization.” Nothing less than “the almost total elimination of the Japanese as a race” seemed likely to insure long-run peace in Asia.52  Yet there was no clear-cut division between vengeful officers and generous civilians.
