the military command, like many Far Eastern experts, grew increasingly restive with a formula that seemed sure to back the Japanese into a corner, extract a fer- ocious price in American lives and treasure, tax the patience of Americans at home, and then saddle the military with the task of restructuring an entire society.  Those interested in modifying the unconditional surrender formula had been given some leverage in statements made by Roosevelt, who had explained that destruction of enemy states was not the goal of the Allies. Moreover, unlike Allied policy toward German surrender, that toward Japanese capitulation had spelled out territorial terms with some specificity. At the least by identifying what Japan would lose, they implied that Japan itself would remain intact.©  But almost no direction came from on high about how to handle the delicate matter of the emperor’s fate, over which much wrangling ensued. Many Far Eastern experts disputed the popular view of an all-powerful monarch indissolubly bound to Japan’s militarism. Close to the emperor, they explained, were leaders who might help engineer an earlier surrender. And regardless of views about the emperor’s culpability for the war, working with him seemed inescapable: without his authority to impose surrender, the task of obtaining capitulation and governing afterward might become hopeless. “To aim at obtaining surrender while ruling out all bargaining on principle is a contradiction in terms,” it has since been pointed out.S2 Some contemporaries appreciated that contradiction.
