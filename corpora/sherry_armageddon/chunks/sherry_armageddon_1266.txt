With its militarists punished, its overseas empire dissolved, and its path to economic expansion opened by abolition of protectionist trade practices, Japan would participate as a constructive partner in a world trade system. As one official argued presciently, the loss of empire was “likely to work” to Japan’s “advantage” in economic terms. Some Japanese and American officials were also converging on a similar point of view regarding the disposition of the subject Asian peoples. As Japan’s pretensions to empire moderated, American calls for a revolutionary upheaval of national liberation became more subdued. Both Americans and Japanese, that is, became less insistent upon refashioning East Asia in their own images.®  Indeed, in retrospect at least, by late 1943 there was already “a rather remarkable parallel between American and Japanese war aims.” Intractable hostility between Japanese and Americans was the appearance of things. “In actuality much in their strategies and plans reflected similar assumptions about Asia and the Pacific.” Indeed, according to Iriye, had Japan approached the United States after Tojo’s fall, it would have found the Americans “more than ready with a peace plan.”®4  Convergence, however at work implicitly, was not to come for a fatefully long time, for its workings were hardly the only “actuality” of the times.
