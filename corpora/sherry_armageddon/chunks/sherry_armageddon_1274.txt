monolithic Nazi state, its aggression and regimentation comparable to Germany’s, only springing from different, less eradicable sources. More than most wartime stereotypes, this one did violence to reality, for regimenta- tion in wartime Japan was a far more subtle, porous phenomenon than in Hitler’s Germany. To be sure, official policies designed to mold seamless unity among Japanese also strengthened the West’s image of the Japanese as an anonymous mass in which no sense of individual values existed.
