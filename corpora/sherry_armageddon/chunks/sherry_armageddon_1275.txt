Conscious of Japan’s place in Nazi racial theory, it had little desire to emulate Nazism, nor a coherent ideology of its own. Much of its apparatus of mobilization moved rather listlessly, and more often it was the war itself—the demands for collective organization and sacrifice it imposed —that mobilized the populace effectively. “Wartime Japan,” it has been argued, “happily escaped the nightmare of rootless mass society enslaved by huge centralized institutions.”®8  Even the much-touted anti-Westernism of wartime Japan had contradictions that revealed the regime’s lack of ideological focus.
