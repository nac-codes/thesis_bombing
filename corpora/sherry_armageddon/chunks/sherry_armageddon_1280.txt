s subtleties was not unique to Americans. In both Japan and the United States, an “exterminationist logic,” expressed viciously in both rhetoric and action, hardened as the war reached its climax, deriving much of its force from the racism shared by the two combatants. But Americans’ sense of racial contempt—displayed in demeaning depictions of the Japanese as rats and apes—had an edge to it missing in Japanese propaganda and passions, if only because Japan’s “indebtedness to the West ... made a Japanese equivalent to white supremacism improbable if not impossible.” Japan’s images of its Western enemies, though often ugly, had an ambiguity—a hint of admiration and of recognition of humanness—derived from that indebtedness, and “whereas racism in the West was markedly characterized by denigration of others, the Japanese were preoccupied far more exclusively with elevating themselves.” Moreover, strategic circum- stances made it harder for the Japanese to act out their racial hatred: by recourse to blockade and bombing, Americans could attack the entire Japanese population, but the Japanese could engage only American servicemen; only against fellow Asians could they fully act out the war’s uglier passions. To be sure, there was also ambiguity in Americans’ racial hatred toward Asians—after all, they were allied with the Chinese. Yet in embracing the Chinese as honorary westerners, Americans did not so much triumph over their racism as reveal how a “migrating stereotype” might be selectively applied to various Asians as circumstances seemed to permit.®  Most tellingly indicative of American racial passions was the persisting image of the Japanese as even more fanatical than the Germans. In the end the Germans proved the more fanatical, both in resisting through the actual invasion and dismemberment of their homeland and in treating captive populations with a disciplined ferocity the Japanese could not match. Yet despite those large differences between their two enemies
