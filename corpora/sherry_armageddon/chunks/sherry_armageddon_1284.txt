t Japan easily shaded off into a larger, undifferentiated fear of the Yellow Peril. Conditions of fighting strengthened the stereotype of Japanese fanaticism. American soldiers met their Asian enemy in terribly close combat, on postage-stamp islands where retreat, surrender, or strategic maneuver were rarely possible, and where most Japanese expected torture or execution should they indeed lay down arms. Moreover, circumstances contributed to a skewed perception of the relative brutality of German and Japanese behavior toward captives and subjects: Nazi war criminals largely victimized Europeans but spared American POWs, whereas Japanese brutality fell heavily on American captives, larger numbers of whom remained far longer under Japanese control and died as a result.

Fighting against them must be like an athletic performance—matching your skill against someone you know is good. Germans are misled, but at least they react like men. But the Japs are like animals. Against them you have to learn a whole new set of physical reactions. You have to get used to their animal
