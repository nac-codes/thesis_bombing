Japanâ€™s surrender terms without worrying about alliance politics, the anxiety they felt about sustaining support for the war against Japan once Germany capitulated, and the simple reality of Nazi refusal to consider anything less than a fight to the finish. American pol- icy on Japanese surrender was at best belatedly related to an underlying realization that Japan might surrender short of suicide.  Circumstances aggravated and confirmed the racial hatreds between Japanese and Americans and the American tendency to regard the Japanese as the more fanatical foe. Few Americans worried that Germany could secure the willing cooperation of other peoples in its cause, but many harbored a fear, well grounded in light of Asian resentment of Western domination, that Japan could enlist other Asians into a race war against the West; consequently, anxieties about Japan easily shaded off into a larger, undifferentiated fear of the Yellow Peril. Conditions of fighting strengthened the stereotype of Japanese fanaticism. American soldiers met their Asian enemy in terribly close combat, on postage-stamp islands where retreat, surrender, or strategic maneuver were rarely possible, and where most Japanese expected torture or execution should they indeed lay down arms. Moreover, circumstances contributed to a skewed perception of the relative brutality of German and Japanese behavior toward captives and subjects: Nazi war criminals largely victimized Europeans but spared American POWs, whereas Japanese brutality fell heavily on American captives, larger numbers of whom remained far longer under Japanese control and died as a result. Unsurprisingly, Americans judged brutality more by the fate of their own countrymen than by the liquidation of distant peoples under Nazi control, just as reports of war crimes committed by an Asian enemy seemed more credible than stories of atrocities committed by Germans, whose ethnic and cultural heritage so many Americans shared.
