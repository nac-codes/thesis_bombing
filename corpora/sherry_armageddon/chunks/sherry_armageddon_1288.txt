orts of war crimes committed by an Asian enemy seemed more credible than stories of atrocities committed by Germans, whose ethnic and cultural heritage so many Americans shared.  In the final analysis, what measured American racism was the failure, even among high officials, to take account of these circumstances and the ease with which they attributed the Japanese style to a bestial nature and an indifference to life rooted in racial characteristics. The Germans seemed an enemy only by virtue of transient Nazi rule. The Japanese seemed an enemy by virtue of race.  To Americans, the Japanese were a less worthy as well as a more fanatical foe. “I wish we were fighting against Germans,” John Hersey quoted one Marine:  They are human beings, like us.
