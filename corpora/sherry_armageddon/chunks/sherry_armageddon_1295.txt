would be peculiarly vulnerable to panic or despair if their cities were torched.73  Asimilar tone emerged in discussions of psychological warfare planning. The navy’s Captain Ellis M. Zacharias, later to gain some fame for his role in surrender and widely regarded as an expert on Japan, viewed Japan as “so rigidly disciplined and indoctrinated as to make Germany seem weak and insurgent in comparison.” Army Intelligence dissented, pointing out that “Japanese surrendered from time to time in the Russo-Japanese War” and that while their image was that of “a mysterious and adamantine mentality which defies all foreign influences,” still “as human beings they follow certain elementary processes of reasoning.” Observers in the Far East reached similar conclusions.”  The crosscurrents of prejudice and policy were muddy. Crude stereotypes might be invoked to caution against expecting too much from bombing: the “remarkable stoicism” of the Japanese argued against believing they were “more vulnerable than other peoples to this form of punishment [bombing].” The same document that characterized the Japanese as “fundamentally human” found them also “by nature volatile and of short enthusiasms.”75 What emerges from these documents is no lack of earnestness in the attempts to understand the Japanese, but the intellectual, cultural, and bureaucratic void in which these attempts took place. Few intellectual criteria existed by which to distinguish racial from situational sources of Japanese behavior. Firsthand knowledge of Japan was uncommon, drawn from a handful of Japanese in the states and from diplomats and missionaries, whose experience had been highly limited. Since no agency distilled the information into a coherent picture, military officers hardly knew how to integrate what they learned into their strategic plans.  The best that might be said is that air officers, despite or because of their naivete, did no worse than officers more experienced in Far Eastern relations. By
