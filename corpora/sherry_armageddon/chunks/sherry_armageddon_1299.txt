that might be said is that air officers, despite or because of their naivete, did no worse than officers more experienced in Far Eastern relations. By the time the bombing began, official policy was rightfully cautious about the psychological intimidation it might inflict. Japanese air raid protection was known to be weak, but the bomber commanders of the Twentieth Air Force were instructed to question the claim that “in the event of bombing, collapse will be rapid.” The airmen who fought the Japanese had learned the hard way to discount coarse stereotypes about how “Japan- ese airplanes were made out of bamboo and paper” and to regard the Japanese as a formidable, if not altogether comprehensible, enemy. Prewar hopes for decisive psychological effects from bombing, already in decline since the war began, were at odds with the commonplace notion of the Japanese as a docile and regimented people. About the most airmen could hope for was a slowly mounting de- moralization and fatigue that would foul the machinery of Japanese production and mobilization.7©  Rash proposals still came forward, such as Norstad’s, late in 1944, to “commemorate December 7th... by a large scale attack on the Imperial Palace in Tokyo” in order to demolish the Japanese notion of their emperor as an “invulnerable deity.” (Apparently just such a commemorative raid was what Tokyo expected and feared.) But outside experts, including Under Secretary of State Joseph Grew, were consulted, and they pointed to the potential of Norstad’s plan to trigger the “grossest mistreatment” of American POWs as well as to play into the hands of the die-hard militarists. Arnold’s own objection was more ominous, characteristically resting not on a view of the enemy but on strategic timetables. “Not at this time,” he instructed Norstad: “Our position—bombing factories, docks, etc.—is sound—Later destroy the whole city.”2”  Arnold’s comments reflected the dominant tone in air force speculation about Japan’s fate.
