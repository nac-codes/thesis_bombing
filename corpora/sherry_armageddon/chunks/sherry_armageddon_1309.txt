a ‘break’ comes the effect is more violent and extreme than with Europeans.” The problem was one “of discovering a technic for the demoralization of a community.” One promising approach was to exploit class an- tagonisms by bombing “workers’ dwelling regions, while (to some extent) sparing upper-class zones.”82  These observations drew upon the language, techniques, and sometimes the specific analyses of a pathbreaking group of social scientists working the new field of “national character” studies. At first glance, their contributions promised to offset the crude racial stereotyping of wartime culture, for they explicitly repudiated racist language and biological determinism. In practice, however, they probably strengthened the impulses of that culture. By drawing on cultural anthropologists’ work on primitive peoples, which focused on “the web of tribal behavior, communal cults, and the like,” wartime students of Japan “reinforced the impression that the Japanese were dressed-up primitives,” thus subtly confirming popular stereotypes of a backward, barbaric people. The social scientists’ characterization of the Japanese as a culturally and psychologically immature and childish people victimized by repressive toilet training—the “Scott Tissue interpretation of history,” as one anthropologist snidely described this line of argument—dovetailed with more vicious popular stereotypes of a simian race arrested in its development. Similarly, the language of individual and social pathology gave sophisticated expression to popular notions of a mad people driven by a lust to torture and conquer. More specifically, the impression they conveyed of a psychologically brittle people provided sanction, if unwitting, to the terror bombing of Japanese cities—a kind of scientific gloss on the widely held (if also disputed) notion that the Japanese would crack under the strain of bomb- ing. In short, the use made of the concept of national character permitted pejorative stereotyping
