if even bombing satisfied the conflicting needs.85 An enemy that continued to fight beyond the point of defeat, as measured by all the conventional standards, was baffling; hence the conclusions of those who tried to understand the enemy pointed in no certain strategic dir- ection and fell into a system where responsibility for acting on conclusions was diffused.

Second, not all air force officers were so quick to dismiss moral issues. Hansell’s memoirs offered a critique of the choices made about bombing policy based on their wastefulness and their damaging consequences for the postwar image of the air force, but also explicitly on the failure to choose a strategy which “would have been far less costly in civilian lives.”8° Even those who asserted that moral concerns did not guide them at the time have since felt compelled to offer a defense of the policies they sanctioned.  A third qualification is broader. When Spaatz later acknowledged that “it wasn’t for religious or moral reasons that I didn’t go along with urban area bombing,” he also recalled how he had believed that precision bombing “could win the war more quickly.”®! That argument was as much a moral as a utilitarian claim, one applied by some to incendiary as well as to precision bombing. Of course, few military men were pressed in wartime to justify strategies in moral terms, except that the protection of American lives and interests was itself a moral concern. But in 1945, as earlier in the war when bombing strategy was formulated, speedy victory at minimum cost remained the implicit moral justification for what the airmen wanted to do.
