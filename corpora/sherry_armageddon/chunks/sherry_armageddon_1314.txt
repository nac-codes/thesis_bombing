category for the application of technique. In war there are many ways to achieve distance from the enemy and from what is done to him. In fighting an elusive enemy, civilian experts cast that elusiveness in new terms rather than clarifying it. Not for them was there the explicit language of racial vengeance. Rather, the language of pathology sanctioned in more subtle and disguised ways the destruction that others justified in bloodier but franker terminology.  By December 1944, as the final air campaign against Japan began, the distance on air war achievable through bureaucracy, methodology, and strategy was also evident culturally and intellectually. A fanatical and cruel enemy deserved punishment, but an unworthy one did not command a commitment in blood to realize that punishment. Bombing might limit the costs. But if, as one high-ranking officer worried, “they will not give up even when faced with certain annihilation,” it was by no means clear if even bombing satisfied the conflicting needs.®5 An enemy that continued to fight beyond the point of defeat, as measured by all the conventional standards, was baffling; hence the conclusions of those who tried to understand the enemy pointed in no certain strategic dir- ection and fell into a system where responsibility for acting on conclusions was diffused.  The American government succumbed to a “failure to distinguish between the problem of inflicting strategic defeat on the enemy and that of inducing him to surrender.” Masters at solving the first problem, its leaders had long assumed that its solution compelled capitulation. As Hansell recalled, “We failed to weigh the urban decimation in terms of our national policies and purposes and in terms of alternate strategies, and ... we were hasty in making a long-term decision in order to provide a solution based upon expediency.”®¢ For this failure responsibility was widespread and rested to a degree with the enemy. It derived from the newness of total war and of ai
