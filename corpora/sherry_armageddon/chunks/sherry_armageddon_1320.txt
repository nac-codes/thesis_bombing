Moreover, “fanaticism is a megalomaniacal condition,” one notable for “a jealous, vindictive and monomaniacal faith,” usually in a party, an organization, or a leader in which is invested a “unique saving function.”8? The air force certainly inspired among its professional officers an intense loyalty but rarely a monomaniacal allegiance. While some wartime scientists maintained an unquestioning faith in their methodology and its beneficence, by no means did all. Nor was faith in the American or the Allied cause always intense or evenly shared. What characterized the experts in air war was their flexibility and control, the ease with which they worked among a variety of organizations serving many purposes, and the skill with which they balanced personal, professional, bureaucratic, and ideological goals. Indeed, the practice of air war grew out of a convergence of diverse appeals, needs, and opportunities, diversity imparting to the bombing much of its  Page 249 of 368 57%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON Olle CULicel eu.  Destruction would win the war. As in Harris’s approach to bombing Germany, it would win by brutalization; terror and economic decline were hard to calculate and gradually became desirable side effects to a strategy that promised victory by total destruction of the enemy state. Without a clear and accurate model of how the enemy thought and how destruction might compel his surren- der, little guided the course of bombing beyond its own internal dynamics and the fearsome prospect of invasion. Once again, intangible criteria invited unlimited destruction.  The formula for unconditional surrender has been faulted often enough for making the enemy fight on. At least as plausibly, it led the Allies to fight on. Particularly in the American war against Japan, it provided few criteria for measuring the relationship of destruction to the attainment of political ends. It seemed only to indicate that the path to unconditional
