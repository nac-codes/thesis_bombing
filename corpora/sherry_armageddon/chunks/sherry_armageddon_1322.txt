What characterized the experts in air war was their flexibility and control, the ease with which they worked among a variety of organizations serving many purposes, and the skill with which they balanced personal, professional, bureaucratic, and ideological goals. Indeed, the practice of air war grew out of a convergence of diverse appeals, needs, and opportunities, diversity imparting to the bombing much of its momentum.

In contrast, if anything seemed to bind Americans together during World War II, it was self-preservation, the lowest common denominator of support for the war effort.  Why, then, call the practitioners of air war fanatics, and what shared mentality constituted their fanaticism? For one thing, fanatical acts are not always the product of frenzied or hateful individuals, as Hannah Arendt has shown in capturing the banality of Adolf Eichmann.*® For another, there was a suggestion of the megalomaniacal among the practitioners of air war in their aspirations for technological omnipotence: over the natural universe for some of the scientists, over the geographic and political world for the airmen striving to achieve a “global” air force, with men like John von Neumann embracing both aspirations. For sure, these aspirations did not often appear suicidal or self-destructive to the men who held them. Yet the technology they created or promoted —finally the atomic bomb but to some degree the apparatus of “conventio
