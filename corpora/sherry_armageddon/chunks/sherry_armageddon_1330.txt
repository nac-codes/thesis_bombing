OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON them to escape responsibility or fulfilled a wish to do so. Actions ceased to be recognized as the product of aggressive wills and became foreordained, irresistible. Certainly, the complexities of modern technology, bureaucracy, and war-making were real enough. The American political system had built-in impediments to accountability because of its diffuse nature, aggravated by the division of responsibilities among the three services. The functional distribution of power along the chain of command and the compartmentalization that accompanied it had much the same effect. Efforts to centralize power, as with Arnold’s command of the Twentieth Air Force, did not necessarily enhance accountability at the top because leaders were so remote from war’s realities. Rarely were these arrangements designed deliberately to negate accountability—as usual, they were a response to perceived necessities. Yet, for a nation with a benign image of its role in the world, eager to mete out punishment to its enemies but reluctant to proclaim its intent to do so, these arrangements were also attractive, desirable.82  The lack of a proclaimed intent to destroy, the sense of being driven by the twin demands of bureaucracy and technology, distinguished America’s technological fanaticism from its enemies’ ideological fanaticism. That both were fanatical was not easily recognizable at the time because the forms were so different. The enemy, particularly the Japanese, had little choice but to be profligate in the expenditure of manpower and therefore in the fervid exhortation of men to hatred and sacrifice—they were not, and knew they were not, a match in economic and technological terms for the Allies. The United States had different resources with which to be fanatical: resources allowing it to take the lives of others more than its own, ones whose accompanying rhetoric of technique disguised the will to destroy. As lavish with machines as th
