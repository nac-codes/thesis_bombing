and he was not about “to waste our bombs on large urban areas as a secondary effort.” Replying directly to Arnold, he opposed Norstad’s demand in no uncertain terms. He had “with great difficulty implanted the principle that our mission is the destruction of primary targets by .. . precision bombing methods.” which he would not abandon just when he was “beginning to get results.” Only after Norstad promised that the fire raid would be only a test for “future planning” would Hansell run the mission, which took place on January 3 with dubious results.®  Hansell sensed the pressure he was under but not its nature and intensity. Area incendiary raids, he wrote in his memoirs, “were to be undertaken only as last resort,” according to the “original plans.” But after Hansell had left Washington, the original plans had been revised to upgrade the priority on incendiary attacks. He had missed out on a crucial stage in planning. Even in Washington, the vague circumlocutions employed and the incremental way by which new assumptions crept into planning obscured the shift. The test raids were repeatedly described as “not a departure from our primary mission to destroy Japanese air power” but as “merely necessary preparation for the future.””  Moreover, Hansell was given the usual reassurances of Arnold’s confidence in him.” ’Who said anything about putting the heat on Possum?’”, Norstad quoted the commanding general in a letter to Possum Hansell. On January 1, Arnold sent Hansell a cheerful New Year’s testament to his “pride” in the 21st’s achievements.
