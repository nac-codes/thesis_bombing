the long arm of Washington, whose grip of command and communication Hansell had helped to mold, was reaching out to him. Later he wished he had rejected Norstad’s advice that “the normal run of difficulties will only be an annoyance to him [Arnold]” and instead have passed them on to Arnold “in more detail.”8  Sometime in December, Arnold decided to sack Hansell. Committed to a doctrine in which for him inhered strategic, political, and moral wisdom, Hansell had aroused his boss’s notorious impatience. Determined to try whatever worked and to try aman who shared that determination, Arnold turned to Curtis LeMay. As Hansell commented at the time, “The boss considers LeMay as the big time operator and me as the planner.” The boss, he later wrote, was also inclined “to measure strategic air attack in terms of tonnage and sorties.” The good soldier, Hansell did not fault Arnold for this inclination, knowing the political pressures on Arnold for results. But he disliked the change in policy his dismissal implied and declined to stay on to assist LeMay, in a relationship he knew would be embarrassing to both men.  If Arnold felt under pressure, it came from an army and navy still eager to make a claim on his big bombers, for neither Roosevelt nor Congress and the press were looking critically at air force operations.
