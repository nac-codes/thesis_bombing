se. Perhaps they thought a final, savage blow by air to the enemy would rescue the air force’s fortunes by forcing early capitulation.13  Impatience to finish off Germany quickly and by a decisive contribution from the air, along with the collapse of German capacity to defend and retaliate, culminated in the bombing that took place over the war’s last winter. The climax came at Dresden, struck on the night of February 13-14 in two ferocious assaults brilliantly executed by British bombers, followed the next day by American bombers (except for forty that mistakenly hit Prague). The resulting firestorm, visible to bomber crews two hundred miles away, struck a city clotted with refugees fleeing other crumbling towns and advancing Soviet armies. Residents of Dresden were also unusually ill-prepared, believing their city exempted from Allied bombing perhaps to save it as the capital of anew Germany. The Dresden death toll, even as later revised downward to thirty-five thousand, was catastrophic and became the focal point of postwar debate about the moral distinctions between the Allies and the Axis. Dresden added to a tally of German civilian fatalities from Anglo-American bombing that reached somewhere between three hundred thousand and six hundred thousand; untold thousands more were killed in other Allied operations, the Red Army in particular razing cities by shelling and tactical air strikes.14  The Dresden raids were less the product of conscious callousness than of casual destructiveness. Indeed, so many had a hand in the decision and so many reasons were available to run it that no clear rationale had to be furnished. One source was plans advanced from the previous summer for terror attacks to force the final breakdown of German morale. Supported by some AAF leaders, momentarily resisted by others and by Eisenhower, indirectly encouraged by Roosevelt, those plans—“baby killing schemes,” as one AAF officer complained—generated intense debate over whether terror at
