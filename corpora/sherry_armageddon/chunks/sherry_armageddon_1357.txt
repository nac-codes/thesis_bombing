momentarily resisted by others and by Eisenhower, indirectly encouraged by Roosevelt, those plans—“baby killing schemes,” as one AAF officer complained—generated intense debate over whether terror attacks would complement the precision campaign or dilute it, enhance the AAF’s reputation or tarnish it, teach Germans a lasting lesson or only embitter them, and inflict righteous revenge or cause American shame. Slow to gain explicit approval, such plans were informally implemented anyway over the winter, particularly in Spaatz’s February 3 raid on Berlin, claimed to have taken twenty-five thousand lives.15  For the RAF’s Harris, the obliteration of cities was routine practice, and Dresden was one city on his list as yet relatively unscathed.
