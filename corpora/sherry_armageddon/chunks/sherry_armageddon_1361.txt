in Spaatz’s February 3 raid on Berlin, claimed to have taken twenty-five thousand lives.15  For the RAF’s Harris, the obliteration of cities was routine practice, and Dresden was one city on his list as yet relatively unscathed. Yet the impetus within British circles to attack Dresden itself came more from Churchill, who knew well how “increasing the terror” could take place “under other pretexts.” Dresden’s marginal war industries, though sometimes cited as justification for the attacks, were not even targeted. With Marshall’s support, Eisenhower’s headquarters probably cut the explicit orders for Dresden, having in mind German morale, plus assisting the Soviet advance westward by disrupting German rail transport and fouling it with refugees. For their part, the Russians encouraged the assistance, though they did not specifically request an attack on Dresden. At least a few British and Americans also sought to impress and perhaps intimidate the Soviets with Anglo-American air power. Certainly Arnold was chagrined that “Stalin hasn't the faintest conception of the damage done to Germany and Japan by strategic bombing,” and his representatives came to the Yalta conference in February with Hollywood pictures and combat footage to make an impres- sion on the assembled Big Three leaders.1®  But to the bomber commanders involved, the Dresden raids did not appear unusual before they were run except for the circuitous channels and prodding by superiors that produced them. Indeed, had the hands of Churchill, Eisenhower, and Marshall not been evident and had not fortuitous factors produced a firestorm, Dresden would probably have escaped critical scrutiny. Harris’s Bomber Command had, on its own authority, already demolished other German cities with a ferocity exceeding that displayed in Dresden. Darmstadt, for example, had been incinerated in a September firestorm because it was destroyable, not because it had even the strategic importance Dresden momentarily possessed.!”
