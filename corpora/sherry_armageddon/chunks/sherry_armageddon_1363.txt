successful interception of Allied bombers. More than that, it further obscured the issue of whether bombers might win wars substantially on their own. Armies drove into a nation that would not submit to terrifying blows from the air. At the same time, armies proceeded at such a slow pace that no ground general discounted the value of air power, tactical and strategic. Still, it must have distressed Arnold to hear Marshall suggest, even before the Battle of the Bulge, that “long-range objectives of strategic bombardment be abandoned for an all-out effort to force an early victory.” Nor could he have been pleased to admit to Marshall on January 8 that strategic bombing was “not having the effect upon the German war effort we had expected and hoped.” For all that Arnold and other air officers had muted their rhetoric about the war-winning capability of air power, they had not substantially changed their views. But vindicating those views was something else. Perhaps they thought a final, savage blow by air to the enemy would rescue the air force’s fortunes by forcing early capitulation.13  Impatience to finish off Germany quickly and by a decisive contribution from the air, along with the collapse of German capacity to defend and retaliate, culminated in the bombing that took place over the war’s last winter. The climax came at Dresden, struck on the night of February 13-14 in two ferocious assaults brilliantly executed by British bombers, followed the next day by American bombers (except for forty that mistakenly hit Prague). The resulting firestorm, visible to bomber crews two hundred miles away, struck a city clotted with refugees fleeing other crumbling towns and advancing Soviet armies. Residents of Dresden were also unusually ill-prepared, believing their city exempted from Allied bombing perhaps to save it as the capital of anew Germany. The Dresden death toll, even as later revised downward to thirty-five thousand, was catastrophic and became the focal point of
