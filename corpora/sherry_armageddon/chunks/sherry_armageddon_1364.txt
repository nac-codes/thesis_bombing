d from Allied bombing perhaps to save it as the capital of anew Germany. The Dresden death toll, even as later revised downward to thirty-five thousand, was catastrophic and became the focal point of postwar debate about the moral distinctions between the Allies and the Axis. Dresden added to a tally of German civilian fatalities from Anglo-American bombing that reached somewhere between three hundred thousand and six hundred thousand; untold thousands more were killed in other Allied operations, the Red Army in particular razing cities by shelling and tactical air strikes.14  The Dresden raids were less the product of conscious callousness than of casual destructiveness. Indeed, so many had a hand in the decision and so many reasons were available to run it that no clear rationale had to be furnished. One source was plans advanced from the previous summer for terror attacks to force the final breakdown of German morale. Supported by some AAF leaders, momentarily resisted by others and by Eisenhower, indirectly encouraged by Roosevelt, those plans—“baby killing schemes,” as one AAF officer complained—generated intense debate over whether terror attacks would complement the precision campaign or dilute it, enhance the AAF’s reputation or tarnish it, teach Germans a lasting lesson or only embitter them, and inflict righteous revenge or cause American shame. Slow to gain explicit approval, such plans were informally implemented anyway over the winter, particularly in Spaatz’s February 3 raid on Berlin, claimed to have taken twenty-five thousand lives.15  For the RAF’s Harris, the obliteration of cities was routine practice, and Dresden was one city on his list as yet relatively unscathed. Yet the impetus within British circles to attack Dresden itself came more from Churchill, who knew well how “increasing the terror” could take place “under other pretexts.” Dresden’s marginal war industries, though sometimes cited as justification for the attacks, were not even target
