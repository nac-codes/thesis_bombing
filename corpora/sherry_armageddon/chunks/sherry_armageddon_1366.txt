es.  Dresden also stirred controversy because of its status as the cultural capital of Germany and because of an Associated Press story based on a SHAEF officer’s briefing and unaccountably cleared by censors. The AP reported that “the Allied air commanders have made the long-awaited decision to adopt deliberate terror bombing of the great German population centers as a ruthless expedient to hasten Hitler’s doom.”!8 Both the British and American high commands were shocked by the appearance of such a claim and fearful of the controversy it seemed destined to arouse. An assistant to the ailing Arnold warned Spaatz of the “nation-wide serious effect on the Air Forces as we have steadily preached the gospel of precision bombing against military and industrial targets.”12  Spaatz’s headquarters labored to assure Washington that there had been “no change in the American policy of precision bombing directed at military objectives.” In a sense the claim was technically correct, and these men really believed that because American planes still flew under directives assigning precise targets, nothing in American targeting practices had changed. But by the end of 1944, American bombers relied on radar or “blind bombing” techniques so often, for roughly three-fourths of their missions, that terror became their inevitable consequence even when defined targets were the avowed objectives. Because that consequence seemed inadvertent and because it came about through a slow erosion of the distinction between precision and area bombing, any con- frontation with moral scruples was forestalled for American commanders, just as it had been earlier for the British until civilians were finally acknowledged as the target. “Radar bombing was better than no bombing,” air force historians aptly paraphrased the bomber commanders’ thinking. On paper there was a policy against “indiscriminate bombing,” Schaffer has pointed out: “Sometimes it was adhered to; often it was not, or it was so broadly r
