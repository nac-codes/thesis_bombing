aphrased the bomber commanders’ thinking. On paper there was a policy against “indiscriminate bombing,” Schaffer has pointed out: “Sometimes it was adhered to; often it was not, or it was so broadly reinterpreted as to become meaningless.” In those circumstances, it was hard to recognize, or at least easy to deny, when the line to a different kind of bombing had been crossed.22  Page 259 of 368 59%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  westWwalu vy UlsL upliip UELiildit Lau LiallspuLe dad LUULLLIE at WiLiL 1eLugees.

Certainly Arnold was chagrined that “Stalin hasn't the faintest conception of the damage done to Germany and Japan by strategic bombing,” and his representatives came to the Yalta conference in February with Hollywood pictures and combat footage to make an impres- sion on the assembled Big Three leaders.1©  But to the bomber commanders involved, the Dresden raids did not appear unusual before they were run except for the circuitous channels and prodding by superiors that produced them. Indeed, had the hands of Churchill, Eisenhower, and Marshall not been evident and had not fortuitous factors produced a firestorm, Dresden would probably have escaped critical scrutiny. Harris’s Bomber Command had, on its own authority, already demolished other German cities with a ferocity exceeding that displayed in Dresden. Darmstadt, for example, had been incinerated in a September firestorm because it was destroyable, not because it had even the strategic importance Dresden momentarily possessed.17 But the world had not noticed, any more than it noticed Hankow or the fate of other German, Italian, and Asian cities.  Dresden also stirred controversy because of its status as the cultural capit
