that are being evacuated to Munich that there is no hope.” Even after Dresden, CLARION was formally ordered by Eisenhower’s headquarters.22  Earlier, Eaker had objected that CLARION would show the Germans “that we are the barbarians they say we are, for it would be perfectly obvious to them that this is primarily a large scale attack on civilians, as, in fact, it of course will be.” But in a climate of degraded sensibilities and informal encouragement, Dresden, like other cities, was razed as the casually accepted by-product of attacks still designated as precise and limited. Spaatz’s deputy revealed as much when he parried Washington's queries about what happened at Dresden. “These attacks [on cities he listed] have not been hailed as terror attacks against populations. ... There has been no change of policy... only a change of emphasis in locale.” The wording simultaneously implied that “terror attacks” were taking place, and yet that they were not because they had not been “hailed” as such.23  Whatever concern Dresden evoked among American leaders was limited. The matter apparently never came to Roosevelt’s attention. Stimson was upset over a German account that made “the destruction seem on its face terrible and probably unnecessary,” but his stated reasons for concern were political: since Dresden was in the “least Prussianized part of Germany,” he explained to Marshall in an eerie echo of the dashed hopes of its residents, it needed to be saved as the “center of a new Germany.” There may have been more than this to Stimson’s anxiety.
