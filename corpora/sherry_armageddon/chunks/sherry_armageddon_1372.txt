OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON ailing Arnold warned Spaatz of the “nation-wide serious effect on the Air Forces as we have steadily preached the gospel of precision bombing against military and industrial targets.”12  Spaatz’s headquarters labored to assure Washington that there had been “no change in the American policy of precision bombing directed at military objectives.” In a sense the claim was technically correct, and these men really believed that because American planes still flew under directives assigning precise targets, nothing in American targeting practices had changed. But by the end of 1944, American bombers relied on radar or “blind bombing” techniques so often, for roughly three-fourths of their missions, that terror became their inevitable consequence even when defined targets were the avowed objectives. Because that consequence seemed inadvertent and because it came about through a slow erosion of the distinction between precision and area bombing, any con- frontation with moral scruples was forestalled for American commanders, just as it had been earlier for the British until civilians were finally acknowledged as the target. “Radar bombing was better than no bombing,” air force historians aptly paraphrased the bomber commanders’ thinking. On paper there was a policy against “indiscriminate bombing,” Schaffer has pointed out: “Sometimes it was adhered to; often it was not, or it was so broadly reinterpreted as to become meaningless.” In those circumstances, it was hard to recognize, or at least easy to deny, when the line to a different kind of bombing had been crossed.2°  Strangely, a drift in the reverse direction had received equally little recognition from the British. “By a curious development of the war’s circumstances,” it was explained to Arnold, “the AAF now bombs blind by day, while the RAF bombs visually (through the use of visual markers) by night. RAF bombing is now in fact frequently more accurate than our own.”2
