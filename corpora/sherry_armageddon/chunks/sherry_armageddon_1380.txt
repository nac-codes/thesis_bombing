At the same time, widely publicized pictures and descriptions of how the great cathedral of Cologne was left standing offered ritual reassurance that for all its destructiveness, Allied bombing had somehow been selective and humane in its targeting.

Commonweal expressed bitter but helpless resignation. It effectively captured how governments had used euphemisms to obscure their barbarism: “ ‘Evacuation of the homeless’ creates ‘a traffic problem.” But “all the best violent words were used up long ago,” and none seemed “left to argue the question of ‘deliberate terror bombing’ ” or to wonder “about how to win the war without making Europe a desert.” The socialist Norman Thomas condemned Allied bombing practices against Japan as well as Germany and correctly linked them to a failure to determine America’s objective in the war—to the “incredibly stupid slogan of unconditional surrender.” Even Thomas, however, had his eye more on the shape of politics to come than on the present: because American airmen “are burning the cities of Japan and the people in them,” Russia will be “the one victor in Asia.” Only in England, which bore greater responsibility for the fate of Germ
