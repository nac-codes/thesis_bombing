sent: because American airmen “are burning the cities of Japan and the people in them,” Russia will be “the one victor in Asia.” Only in England, which bore greater responsibility for the fate of Germany’s cities, did a clear debate take shape, beginning the process of “dishonoring” Harris for practices his superiors had sanctioned.28  In general, then, American military leaders had feared an outcry that never arose.?2 Yet their nervousness had significance, indicating their perceptions of limits to what the nation might accept in the way of destruction against the Germans. Although uncritical, press coverage of Germany’s destruction was notably free of the spirit of revenge, implying that bombing was acceptable only as a military necessity. And as the Joint Chiefs were advised by Elmer Davis, long-standing distinctions made by Americans between their two major enemies were still evident in the muted reactions offered to the winter’s bombing campaign: “There did not appear to be a great deal of opposition from the humanitarian point of view to the bombing of Japan,” the head of the Office of War Informa-  Page 261 of 368 60%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  bombers stirred Admiral Leahy’s fear of an “inhumane and barbarous type of warfare with which the United States should not be associated.” But Leahy’s doubts were overcome by reassurances from the air force that accuracy had been improved and would not be any worse than in the radar bombing already going on. Besides, the use of war-weary bombers against Germany would be a warm-up for employing them against Japan, and as Leahy advised Roosevelt, tests would be of “inestimable value” for postwar development of guided missiles, a field in which German superiority had caused Anglo-American embarrassment. All of these arguments, plus the dividend of “creating further destruction in an already frantic condition in Germany,” appear to have been accepted by Roosevelt. They were also pressed by
