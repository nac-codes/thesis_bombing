lay of air power than had been possible in Europe. At the same time, though cautious about how attacks on Japan should be portrayed, it had cause for believing that the constraints of public opinion, loose enough in any event, would be few indeed in the Asian war. After all, the enemy there was still identified as “rats” in respectable publications, and Americans were cheered on as “Rodent Exterminators.”3 Indignation was recharged by the sight of gaunt and maimed American POWs rescued in February during the Philippines campaign and by the stories of kamikaze attacks over the winter and spring of 1945. To be sure, the same period brought stunning revelations of Nazi atrocities as concentration camps were at last overrun. But Americans were rarely the victims, Germany was clearly a defeated nation, its performance in the field still commanded grudging respect, and the cruder forms of indignation that emerged were largely confined to its Nazi leaders.  GRAND STRATEGY ON HOLD  Delays in defeating the Germans were worrisome in their own right and also for the genera] urgency they stirred about B-29 operations against Japan. Their negative repercussions for the Pacific war were also quite specific. For one thing, prolongation of the European war threatened to postpone redeployment of American forces in Europe to the Pacific. The previous summer, in the flood tide of optimism that swept in after the Normandy landings, American planners had hoped that Kyushu and maybe even Honshu could be invaded by October 1, 1945, or perhaps even as early as July 1. After the Ardennes offensive, the summer date, at the least, was out of the question. For the AAF, the delay was something of a mixed blessing. “We may thus be forced,” noted the Joint Staff Planners, “from our ‘invasion’ strategy into a ‘blockade’ strategy, at least temporarily, by our inability to assemble [the] forces required.”32 The air force thereby gained more time to exercise the muscle of the B-29s. But there was no
