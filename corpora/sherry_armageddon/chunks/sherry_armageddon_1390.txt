Japanese surrender on the continent. A seemingly minor matter—Soviet weather reports—also became vital in light of the obstacles facing the B-29s; the only information LeMay was getting from the Russians came through breaking their codes, not the most seemly practice among Allies. Encouragingly, in the fall Stalin had promised American access to air bases in the Maritime Territory, promises renewed at Yalta. American military leaders still welcomed Russian help: MacArthur grasped at the opportunity (just as he had in 1941), though finding it convenient to lie about his views once the Cold War heated up. But particularly for those Americans familiar with the shuttle bombing affair in Europe, hope was tempered by uncertainty about stripping the veil of Soviet secrecy and securing practical arrangements.34  For Arnold and his new bomber commander in the Marianas, these complications of global strategy composed the backdrop for vexing operational concerns. On January 6, Norstad had flown out to the 21st’s sprawling new headquarters on Guam to give Hansell the bad news and confer with LeMay, who arrived the next day. For the men on Guam, wary of the new general coming in to replace a trusted commander, LeMay provided a bit of surprise. Despite his reputation for toughness, he was quiet to the point of being tight-lipped, his voice barely audible to the men around him.

He still worried about the backlash of inflated expectations: “We have built up ideas in the Army, the Navy, and among civilians of what we can do with our B-29s.” The enormous investment poured into the B-29 had to be justified. “These airplanes are quite expensive a
