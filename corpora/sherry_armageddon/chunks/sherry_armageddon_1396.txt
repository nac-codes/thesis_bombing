r. Such bombing had long been in the plans, and the rare attempts to justify hastening it simply cited previous decisions for an early invasion—invasion sanctioned a quick campaign of aerial destruction, not slower paralysis by precision bombing and blockade of economic lifelines. This was also the rationale for resisting Chester Nimitz’s pleas to supplement the navy’s devastating submarine campaign against  Page 264 of 368 60%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  this stocky, plain-looking new commanding general.”35  Back in Washington, the change of command did not make Arnold confident of early success. He still worried about the backlash of inflated expectations: “We have built up ideas in the Army, the Navy, and among civilians of what we can do with our B-29s.” The enormous investment poured into the B-29 had to be justified. “These airplanes are quite expensive and carry with them a crew of 12 men, and yet our results are far from what we expected and from what everyone else expects.” Politics once again accounted for Arnold’s demand to step up operations, as Hansell had discerned.3®  Once again, Washington pressed for an incendiary campaign, now questioning the wisdom of postponing the fire raids until precision targets were finished off. When LeMay, his precision attacks meeting the same fate as Hansell’s, urged a switch to less “hotly defended” industrial targets, Norstad suggested—after the usual words about not wanting to erode a commander’s prerogatives —an incendiary raid on the most densely settled area of Kobe. In Washington, it now was clear that “the purpose of this attack is not experimental,” and LeMay’s Kobe strike on February 3 was demonstrably more successful than the earlier tests of incendiary attacks. The same day Washington was preparing plans for a similar strike on an area of Tokyo that “does not include many high priority industrial targets” but had “the highest density of population found” in the city and was “r
