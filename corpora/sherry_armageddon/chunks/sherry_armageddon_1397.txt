gton was preparing plans for a similar strike on an area of Tokyo that “does not include many high priority industrial targets” but had “the highest density of population found” in the city and was “rated as highest in fire hazard for insurance purposes.” On the twelfth, Norstad instructed LeMay to prepare for creating a “conflagration” in Nagoya, apologizing for going “into tactical detail that properly is your responsibility.”37  On February 19, Washington further clarified the priority for incendiary runs. LeMay was informed that Japanese aircraft engine plants remained his primary objective, but now “selected urban areas for test incendiary attack” became a clear “secondary” priority. The next day Norstad told LeMay to launch a maximum mission against Japan. When LeMay responded with the kind of objection that Hansell had earlier served up—a wish not to interrupt his “rigid training schedule”—Norstad overrode him, citing “circumstances beyond our control,” quite possibly the bloody effort to capture Iwo Jima; as the primary beneficiary of that effort, the air force could hardly refuse to support it. LeMay ran the biggest mission yet of the war and the biggest “test” of fire raid tactics. Choos- ing between Nagoya and Tokyo, he sent out some 231 B-29s to hit the capital on the twenty-fifth.28  Pressure on LeMay was communicated in other ways besides the push for incendiary bombing. There was the usual concern about public relations, Washington fearful that “the news interest in [B-29] operations is watered pretty thin.” Air force head-quarters also noted the difficulty LeMay was having in hitting the Japanese aircraft industry: one important plant had been singled out eight times for attack, to no avail, and yet, embarrassingly, the navy did more damage to the plant with only one carrier strike. True, Japanese aircraft production was falling rapidly by February, but due partly to general shortages and a decision to disperse the industry; the Twentieth could claim
