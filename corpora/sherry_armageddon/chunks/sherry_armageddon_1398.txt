with only one carrier strike. True, Japanese aircraft production was falling rapidly by February, but due partly to general shortages and a decision to disperse the industry; the Twentieth could claim only indirect credit for the enemy’s decline. Moreover dispersion threatened to make targets harder to find, increasing the urgency of inflicting as “much destruction of existing factories” as possible in the next six weeks, as Norstad told LeMay on February II.32  The movement toward area bombing of cities was accelerating in these weeks but still apart from any sustained effort to rethink strategy for bringing about Japan’s surrender. Such bombing had long been in the plans, and the rare attempts to justify hastening it simply cited previous decisions for an early invasion—invasion sanctioned a quick campaign of aerial destruction, not slower paralysis by precision bombing and blockade of economic lifelines. This was also the rationale for resisting Chester Nimitz’s pleas to supplement the navy’s devastating submarine campaign against Japanese shipping by having B-29s sow the enemy’s narrow sea-lanes with mines. In reality the air force remained fearful of being drawn into the navy’s war, although in February LeMay began training crews in mine-laying operations, lest the navy have an excuse for acquiring its own long-range bombers for such operations. As the air force’s historians noted pointedly, “Evidently the air planners did not envisage the extraordinary success that was to follow, but it is questionable whether they could have acted differently if they had.” For them, the only task was to carve out the heart of Japan’s industrial economy; veins and arteries had little attraction.4°  The AAF’s resistance to blockade and mining also stemmed from poor insight into the perilous nature of Japan’s war economy. The air force’s winter attacks on Japan, though disappointing, had far more dire consequences for Japan than did the early bombing of Germany because they stru
