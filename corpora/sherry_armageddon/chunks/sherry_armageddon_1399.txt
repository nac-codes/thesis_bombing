perilous nature of Japan’s war economy. The air force’s winter attacks on Japan, though disappointing, had far more dire consequences for Japan than did the early bombing of Germany because they struck a nation already mobilized almost to the limit. Whereas the Allies for years had to bomb through a sizable cushion of German productive capacity, any destruction against Japan hurt, far more so when magnified by the navy’s efforts. In restrospect at least, the long and vexing delay in air operations against Japan turned out to be a boon for the air force, making almost any bombs dropped count for something—and in the process, making the flaws of tactics, strategy, and moral vision less glaring because quick success seemed to justify what had been done. The relative success against Japan resulted primarily from the accidents of strategic timing and Japan’s relative defenselessness.  More sensitive to operational considerations than to grand strategy, air planners in February 1945 worried about the weather. Volatile enough over the winter, it seemed likely to “get progressively worse over the homeland of Japan until midsummer.” Forecasters thus sanctioned a hurry-up effort against Japan’s aircraft industry while some precision attacks remained possible and then a campaign against cities. Further-more, Germany’s collapse seemed likely to coincide with the bad weather campaign, and the effect of its defeat “upon the Japanese people might be significantly if not critically increased by a comprehensive attack on Japan’s major urban industrial areas.”41 Speculation about a strategy of early surrender was rare, however; the staff’s energies focused on ex- panding operations and the economic dislocation they would cause.  With the air force attending to operations and the Joint Chiefs’ deliberations dwindling, it fell to others to peer into the future of Japan’s surrender. At Yalta Churchill had opened a new path by suggesting “mitigation” of the unconditional surrender formu
