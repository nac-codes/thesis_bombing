hiefs’ deliberations dwindling, it fell to others to peer into the future of Japan’s surrender. At Yalta Churchill had opened a new path by suggesting “mitigation” of the unconditional surrender formula and an ultimatum to call on the Japanese to surrender. Marshall and other military leaders were sympathetic to modification of the formula, particularly on the question of the emperor’s fate, but met resistance from State’s representatives and apparently had no sanction from Roosevelt to pursue Churchill’s idea. Progress in thrash- ing out a formula would not resume until April.42  Secretary of War Henry L.

Yet through February and March they dwelt on issues at the fringes of surrender policy—Philippine independence, the economic rehabilitation of Japan after the war, the fate of Japan’s mandated islands—but not surrender itself. On February 20, the newly re-turned Admiral William “Bull” Halsey warned Stimson against any relaxation of peace terms because too many Japanese were “unregenerate and there was no hope of educating them to a decent life.” But neither the talk with Halsey nor other deliberations that month prodded Stimson into immedi- ate action.43  Stimson was also critically located to connect atomic policy with conventional military strategy and the concern about surrender.
