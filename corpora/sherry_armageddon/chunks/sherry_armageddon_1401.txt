When LeMay, his precision attacks meeting the same fate as Hansell’s, urged a switch to less “hotly defended” industrial targets, Norstad suggested—after the usual words about not wanting to erode a commander’s prerogatives —an incendiary raid on the most densely settled area of Kobe. In Washington, it now was clear that “the purpose of this attack is not experimental,” and LeMay’s Kobe strike on February 3 was demonstrably more successful than the earlier tests of incendiary attacks. The same day Washington was preparing plans for a similar strike on an area of Tokyo that “does not include many high priority industrial targets” but had “the highest density of population found” in the city and was “rated as highest in fire hazard for insurance purposes.” On the twelfth, Norstad instructed LeMay to prepare for creating a “conflagration” in Nagoya, apologizing for going “into tactical detail that properly is your responsibility.”3”  On February 19, Washington further clarified the priority for incendiary runs. LeMay was informed that Japanese aircraft engine plants remained his primary objective, but now “selected urban areas for test incendiary attack” became a clear “secondary” priority. The next day Norstad told LeMay to launch a maximum mission against Japan. When LeMay responded with the kind of objection that Hansell had earlier served up—a wish not to interrupt his “rigid training schedule”—Norstad overrode him, citing “circumstances beyond our control,” quite possibly the bloody effort to capture Iwo Jima; as the primary beneficiary of that effort, the air force cou
