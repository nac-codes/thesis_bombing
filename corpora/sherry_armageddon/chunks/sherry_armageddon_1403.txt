blockade of economic lifelines. This was also the rationale for resisting Chester Nimitz’s pleas to supplement the navy’s devastating submarine campaign against Japanese shipping by having B-29s sow the enemy’s narrow sea-lanes with mines. In reality the air force remained fearful of being drawn into the navy’s war, although in February LeMay began training crews in mine-laying operations, lest the navy have an excuse for acquiring its own long-range bombers for such operations. As the air force’s historians noted pointedly, “Evidently the air planners did not envisage the extraordinary success that was to follow, but it is questionable whether they could have acted differently if they had.” For them, the only task was to carve out the heart of Japan’s industrial economy; veins and arteries had little attraction.4°  The AAF’s resistance to blockade and mining also stemmed from poor insight into the perilous nature of Japan’s war economy. The air force’s winter attacks on Japan, though disappointing, had far more dire consequences for Japan than did the early bombing of Germany because they struck a nation already mobilized almost to the limit. Whereas the Allies for years had to bomb through a sizable cushion of German productive capacity, any destruction against Japan hurt, far more so when magnified by the navy’s efforts. In restrospect at least, the long and vexing delay in air operations against Japan turned out to be a boon for the air force, making almost any bombs dropped count for something—and in the process, making the flaws of tactics, strategy, and moral vision less glaring because quick success seemed to justify what had been done. The relative success against Japan resulted primarily from the accidents of strategic timing and Japan’s relative defenselessness.  More sensitive to operational considerations than to grand strategy, air planners in February 1945 worried about the weather. Volatile enough over the winter, it seemed likely to “get progressiv
