nder policy—Philippine independence, the economic rehabilitation of Japan after the war, the fate of Japan’s mandated islands—but not surrender itself. On February 20, the newly re-turned Admiral William “Bull” Halsey warned Stimson against any relaxation of peace terms because too many Japanese were “unregenerate and there was no hope of educating them to a decent life.” But neither the talk with Halsey nor other deliberations that month prodded Stimson into immedi- ate action.*3  Stimson was also critically located to connect atomic policy with conventional military strategy and the concern about surrender. No one else of his stature had given the bomb as much thought. But, as earlier, when leaders lifted their eyes from immediate technical and policy concerns, they looked past the intermediate issue of surrender and gazed into the murkier reaches of postwar policy. Indeed, as his biographer has said, “On the question of whether this power should or should not be applied within the particular context of the war the Secretary said no single word.” Just as Arnold’s vision oscillated between the daily task of operations and the lure of greatness for the air force after the war, Stimson was pulling away from the rapidly disappearing problems of the bomb’s technical development to ponder its place in long-run strategy for handling the Soviet Union. Much the same could be said of scientific advisors like Bush and Conant and of working scientists, who, when not still immersed in just trying “to get the job done,” ignored the bomb’s use and wondered: “What should be done to make sure the possibilities of atomic weapons in the hand of a future Na- poleon or Hitler would not bring world disaster?”44  Page 266 of 368 61%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON PLepale LUL CLeally a CULaplauUll 111 INaBUYd, APOLOBIZINIY LOL BULB LILU LACLICaL UELALL Lal PLUpe lly 15 YOUL LESPULISIDILILy, =  On February 19, Washington further clarified the priority for ince
