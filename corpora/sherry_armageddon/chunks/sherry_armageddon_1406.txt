LeMay was informed that Japanese aircraft engine plants remained his primary objective, but now “selected urban areas for test incendiary attack” became a clear “secondary” priority. The next day Norstad told LeMay to launch a maximum mission against Japan. When LeMay responded with the kind of objection that Hansell had earlier served up—a wish not to interrupt his “rigid training schedule”—Norstad overrode him, citing “circumstances beyond our control,” quite possibly the bloody effort to capture Iwo Jima; as the primary beneficiary of that effort, the air force could hardly refuse to support it. LeMay ran the biggest mission yet of the war and the biggest “test” of fire raid tactics. Choos- ing between Nagoya and Tokyo, he sent out some 231 B-29s to hit the capital on the twenty-fifth.28  Pressure on LeMay was communicated in other ways besides the push for incendiary bombing. There was the usual concern about public relations, Washington fearful that “the news interest in [B-29] operations is watered pretty thin.” Air force head-quarters also noted the difficulty LeMay was having in hitting the Japanese aircraft industry: one important plant had been singled out eight times for attack, to no avail, and yet, embarrassingly, the navy did more damage to the plant with only one carrier strike. True, Japanese aircraft production was falling rapidly by February, but due partly to general shortages and a decision to disperse the industry; the Twentieth could claim only indirect credit for the enemy’s decline. Moreover dispersion threatened to make targets harder to find, increasing the urgency of inflicting as “much destruction of existing factories” as possible in the next six weeks, as Norstad told LeMay on February II.32  The movement toward area bombing of
