ld’s vision oscillated between the daily task of operations and the lure of greatness for the air force after the war, Stimson was pulling away from the rapidly disappearing problems of the bomb’s technical development to ponder its place in long-run strategy for handling the Soviet Union. Much the same could be said of scientific advisors like Bush and Conant and of working scientists, who, when not still immersed in just trying “to get the job done,” ignored the bomb’s use and wondered: “What should be done to make sure the possibilities of atomic weapons in the hand of a future Na- poleon or Hitler would not bring world disaster?”44  In a way, it was odd that Stimson in particular overlooked the surrender issue. Self-appointed expert on Japan, he might have been expected to take the lead. But when he had a “long talk with Marshall on the coming campaign against Japan” on February 27, he acknowledged that “it is a new problem for me.” One difficulty for Stimson, as for many tired leaders late in the war, was a calendar cluttered with more immediate issues. But if a fatigued nearsightedness had been the only problem, Stimson would not have looked so closely at issues of postwar policy. More likely, he saw nothing problematical about securing Japan’s surrender and using the bomb to get it. A half century in public life had taught that “power when available but renounced as an instrument of policy—out of fear or guilt or presumptions of kindness—had, in his time, produced meaningless confusions and then the perilous circumstance.”45  To the extent that Stimson and his staff did think about the bomb’s use, politics and public relations were the prods: concern about how to announce the bomb’s use and about “a growing restlessness and impatience among Members of Congress on account of the size and cost of the project.” No one recorded the possibility of using the bomb in order to justify the lavish expenditures blindly allocated, but the War Department’s senior administ
