use and about “a growing restlessness and impatience among Members of Congress on account of the size and cost of the project.” No one recorded the possibility of using the bomb in order to justify the lavish expenditures blindly allocated, but the War Department’s senior administrators did record threats of congressional investigation and the helpfulness of telling concerned congressmen that the Manhattan Project would provide “the possible ultimate success of the war in case of a deadlock.”46  Roosevelt himself had his eyes on the postwar implications of atomic energy. He continued, of course, to approve efforts to develop the bomb and deliver it against Japan. But in his last months, perhaps the only major operational issue of the Pacific war to which he made a concrete contribution was one of a very different sort. According to one account, Roosevelt received the approval of Nimitz and the Combined Chiefs for use of poison gas against the Japanese on Iwo Jima but scotched the idea. If he made such a decision, it probably rested on no aversion to new weapons, given his simultaneous support of the bomb’s development and the use of war-weary bombers against Germany. But initiating use of a weapon with a loathsome reputation posed a different problem than that raised by atomic bombing, about which no prior judgment could be reached in public and against which no enemy could retaliate. With the grimmest fighting still anticipated in Germany and the Pa- cific, introducing chemical or biological weapons would have established a nasty precedent.47  COMMAND DECISION  Regarding the winter’s exercises in grand strategy and diplomacy, LeMay contributed and heard little. He was a field commander, and his job was to mobilize and direct his force. Sometime that winter he was informed about the atomic bomb project because training for an atomic mission had to take place in the Marianas, using the planes in which LeMay was expert and coordinated with the operations he conducted
