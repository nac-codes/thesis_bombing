He got the best out of weak men, and more out of the best men. It was not just wartime hyperbole for his public relations officer to write a few months later: “He had trained them heartlessly, having a heart that revolted at the idea of what lack of discipline and training would mean to his young crews.”5°  Still, there was little immediate success.

No one questioned the cooperativeness of Nimitz, whose navy provided so much of LeMay’s logistical support. But under Nimitz were the admirals and captains who aroused LeMay’s amusement and disgust.
