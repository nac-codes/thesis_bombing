steadily, though stepped-up training kept combat sorties from rising as fast. In February, he gained another important advantage with the capture of Iwo Jima, robbing the enemy of a forward warning station, placing American escort fighters within reach of Japan, and providing new weather stations and an emergency landing field that reduced B-29 losses dramatically.  The “tender and the trivial” matters that saved crewmen and put bombs on target consumed LeMay. He led men with skill, even though privately he condemned “a blundering staff” that was “practically worthless.” He had inherited shoddy outfits before; he knew what to do. Only a few key men were replaced, a few others reshuffled. Otherwise he led by example, by a kind of unadorned optimism, by simple command rather than exhortation or intimidation, and by the good humor men under stress must have. Those who knew him better soon learned that his “grimace is a smile,” his Bell’s palsy simply inverting what pleasure did to other men’s faces. He got the best out of weak men, and more out of the best men. It was not just wartime hyperbole for his public relations officer to write a few months later: “He had trained them heartlessly, having a heart that revolted at the idea of what lack of discipline and training would mean to his young crews.”5°  Still, there was little immediate success. Some precision strikes worked, some incendiary raids showed promise, but the direction of LeMay’s command was still indeterminate as February drew toaclose, when he “woke up... to the fact that I hadn’t gotten anything much done any better than Possum Hansell had.” Beyond him loomed the Washington command structure, so haltingly trying to get a grip on strategy, so firmly in the grip of continued rivalry among the services. LeMay had never been part of the “skullduggery that went on in Washington” regarding conflict among the armed forces, but he was fully aware of how the services warred for glory and resources.5!
