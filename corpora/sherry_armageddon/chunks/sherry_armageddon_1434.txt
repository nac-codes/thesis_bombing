Washington had repeatedly urged further incendiary runs. How much LeMay improvised with his own staff was unclear, perhaps even to him in the haste to make decisions: ideas and precedents could be in the back of his mind without ransacking the files. His command genius lay in his decision to avoid introducing these methods piecemeal, to take the parts and throw them together at once, producing a whole dwarfing the sum of its parts.  The decision did not come easily. Despite his toughness, the doubts kept bubbling up. There was a career at stake. There was Washington to satisfy, with Norstad due to be on the scene. Above all, there were the men in the bombers, flying in low and defenseless. He could hope for their success; he could not rule out for them suicide. As LeMay later dramatized what went through his mind: “Dear General Washington. Dear General Knox. Dear General Gates. Dear General Greene. This is the anniversary of the day you killed my son Eben, my son Jeremiah, my son Watson, my son John. You killed him at Princeton, at Monmouth, at Saratoga, at Germantown.”58 LeMay had faced this responsibility before but never with so many men, never trying such a sudden leap into new tactics, never with so much anxiety.  There was another anxiety, but LeMay was not in touch with it. Harboring no special hatred for the enemy whom he now proposed to slaughter, he confronted no overt anxiety about doing so. But lack of hateful intent did not entirely placate a primitive sense of uneasiness. Everything that he had learned of command responsibility made it acceptable to be anxious about the fate he might deliver to his own men. On their fate his conscious anxiety comfortably focused. But he was troubled and defensive in other ways which he did not articulate to himself or others.52  There was hardly time to do so anyway. The tactical elements involved were assembled in a rush, and no subordinate was likely to question a commander about the ethical and strategic issues pos
