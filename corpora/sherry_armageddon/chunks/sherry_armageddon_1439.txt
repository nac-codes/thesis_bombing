ht, residents of Tokyo began noticing a strange display in the skies over their city. They had been through air raids before, and some, like their counterparts in Europe’s threatened cities, had developed superstitions—food rituals, the wearing of Western clothes—to ward off danger.®? That night’s activities seemed different.  In daylight raids, the B-29s had appeared “translucid, unreal, light as fantastic glass dragonflies.” Now, at night, flying low and catching spectral colors from flak bursts and searchlights and explosions below, they evoked more menacing images, one moment “their long, glinting wings, sharp as blades” as they caught the light, another appearing as “black silhouettes gliding through the fiery sky,” only to reemerge “shining golden against the dark roof of heaven or glittering blue, like meteors, in the searchlight beams spraying the vault from horizon to horizon.” With each flash of light, the bombers would be momentarily frozen in the sky, like giant insects caught in amber. Then, as the fires spread and coalesced to produce a steadier glow, “ghastly reflections of the fire” were seen “on the wings of those silvery ghosts.” In the sustained, garish light, the insects gained motion.
