districts; followers fed and broadened it for some three hours thereafter. LeMay’s tactical design worked. Another design, the government’s plan for defense, was being played out below. “Why should we be afraid of air raids?” a patriotic song had run. “The big sky is protected with iron defenses. For young and old it is time to stand up. .. . Come on, enemy planes. Come on many times.” Their government had instructed Japanese that they had “only two choices before them: to be victorious, or perish.” Victims of faithful obedience to their leaders’ edicts, having at first little reason to know their futility, fire fighters and citizens stayed to quench the flames with their thousands of wet mats and waterbuckets. Or they cowered in the promised safety of shallow slit trenches—Tokyo’s water table turned anything deeper into a cesspool—that had indeed earlier provided a little protection when high explosives had fallen. Too quickly to allow easy escape, the bombs “scattered a kind of flam- ing dew that skittered along the roofs, setting fire to everything it splashed and spreading a wash of dancing flames everywhere.”®©  Tokyo was unprepared. Despite Japan’s own experience in bombing others in China, despite the warnings served up in test fire raids, despite some vivid reporting on the fate of Germany’s cities, little had been done. Before March 9, perhaps 1,700,000 residents had already left the city. But except for the evacuation of schoolchildren—carried out not to protect them but to save them “as a human resource in the abstract”—their exodus owed little to the government, far more to the lash of fear. Some 6,000,000 remained. On the government’s part, waterways had been too much trusted to stop flames, firebreaks had been widely but incompletely cleared, concrete shelters had rarely been constructed. Antiaircraft defenses were technically inadequate except for a fairly efficient radar detec- tion and warning system. With defense overwhelmed, the battle, insofar a
