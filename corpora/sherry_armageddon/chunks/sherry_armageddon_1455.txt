With defense overwhelmed, the battle, insofar as there was one, took place between civilians on the ground and technicians in the air.S”  Tokyo did not explode, it descended into “an ‘infernum’ ... like that which Dante... describes in his Divina commedia.”®8 A few months later, the atomic bombs would erupt without warning and with apocalyptic instancy, most of their fury telescoped into seconds of transcendent destruction. There is no way to compare different experiences of terror when each has its own kind of totality, but Tokyo held a different horror and fascination.

In Hiroshima and Nagasaki, most victims did not know what hit them, confronting personal extinction first; the survivors only later suffered the shock of communal annihilation as they crawled out of their wreckage and met the parade of the damned.
