To these buildings police directed panicked crowds, but sometimes incendiaries pierced roofs of corrugated steel or reinforced concrete, or smoke filtered in and asphyxiated the refugees, or fires sucked out their oxygen, or heat penetrated to ignite the building’s interior or bake its inhabitants.”  That, at least, is the gruesome speculation about the manner of death left behind by witnesses and survivors who entered the blackened area. But it is almost a black hole of speculation. The number killed was possibly double the number injured, probably a higher ratio than at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,”3 suggesting that escape and survival were harder in this conventional raid than in the atomic blasts. Most survivors started their journey to safety already on the fringes of the storm, and accounts of the struggle at its center are few. Furthermore, the Japanese government made few efforts to study the pathology of death and injury, a contrast to German medical resourcefulness that American survey teams later regarded as “almost unbelievable.” Later, the political notoriety, scientific interest, and symbolism attached to Hiroshima and Nagasaki so eclipsed the Tokyo fire raid that far less interest developed in collecting its victims’ recollections and examining their  Page 274 of 368 62%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON pusneda over oy the surlace winds to toucn the ground ana gain new fury trom the oxygen and comoustibies It seizea.
