as a giant bellows to superheat the air to eighteen hundred degrees Fahrenheit.”°  In flight lay the only salvation, just as at Dresden and Hamburg, but few who fled successfully could recall how they did so. Hisaki Imai remembered deciding to gather up his younger brother and race against the prevailing tide of humanity to strike out for a vacant lot. Then, somehow, when he found the vacant lot was built wp with houses sure to catch the flames, the two fled with dampened towels over their faces to the Tokyo waterfront and survived the night. Most made the wrong choice or found their flight blocked by the debris whistling through the air or by the thicket of fallen poles and charged electric wires that clogged the streets. Fire alone was not the only danger. The superheated vapors rushing ahead of the wall of flames killed or knocked unconscious its victims even before the flames reached them, just as “entire block fronts burst into flames before the main body of the fire reached them.” The mechanisms of death were so multiple and simultaneous—oxygen deficiency and carbon monoxide poisoning, radiant heat and direct flames, debris and the trampling feet of stampeding crowds—that causes of death were later hard to ascertain, though the position in which many were found indicated, in the misleading words of the Strategic Bombing Survey, that they “died peacefully and without evidence of struggle.”74  Natural instincts betrayed thousands. Waterways running through the city offered apparent relief: the chance to get across to an area as yet untouched by flame or to douse oneself in the waters. But bridges were often burned out and crowds piled up at their approaches, trampling some and pushing others into the water to drown; on surviving bridges, others were forced to jump when the steel structures became unbearably hot. A head above water was no guarantor of safety, as the noxious fumes and superheated air still snuffed out life or fired the water until “the luckless ba
