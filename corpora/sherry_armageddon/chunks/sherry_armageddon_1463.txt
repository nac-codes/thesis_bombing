Perhaps that is why Europeans in Tokyo sometimes referred to the March 10 raids as a “frightful Pentecost” or a realization of Dante’s inferno. But a French priest abandoned religious imagery in trying to describe “that fairy scene” of “shooting stars and meteors” and “comets,” “these phenomena of nature.” Even more so among Tokyo’s natives, images of the great raid usually referred to the natural world, as if what man had destroyed by harnessing nature had sprung from nature herself, as if Tokyo had been visited by a plague of monstrous, demonic, fire-breathing insects. These images occurred readily in a society that placed heavy emphasis on the visual sense; that had a well-developed idiom for describing “a pure and sacred homeland imperiled by bestial and demonic outsiders”; that had, by the style of its residential construction and the abruptness of its modernization, less distance than European societies from the natural world.
