Perhaps that is why Europeans in Tokyo sometimes referred to the March 10 raids as a “frightful Pentecost” or a realization of Dante’s inferno. But a French priest abandoned religious imagery in trying to describe “that fairy scene” of “shooting stars and meteors” and “comets,” “these phenomena of nature.” Even more so among Tokyo’s natives, images of the great raid usually referred to the natural world, as if what man had destroyed by harnessing nature had sprung from nature herself, as if Tokyo had been visited by a plague of monstrous, demonic, fire-breathing insects.

Moreover, because the conflagration did not simply happen, but evolved and mutated, and because the wind did so much to spawn the conflagration, as it ihight in the fires following an earthquake, nature herself seemed to have revolted—perhaps why, as Kato noted, “a popular debate” soon developed “about which was more dangerous, earthquakes or bombs.” The allusions to nature’s revolt reflected and sustained the sense of a horror transcending human capacity and culpability, unleashed on people too numbed anyway to attempt much conscious effort at explanation.®®  The sense of an incomprehensible experience was borne out in reactions to the enemy. To be sure, the trappings of patriotic resistance were maintained in the raid’s wake. Even on March 10, as some fires were still burning, a parade marking armed forces day marched down undamaged sections of downtown Tokyo. “In the heart of the ordinary Japanese,” Kato later claimed, “there was hatred and bitterness against
