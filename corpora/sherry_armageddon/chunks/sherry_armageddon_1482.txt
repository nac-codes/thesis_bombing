ly arose, however, despite exodus: housing in Japan’s cities, densely packed before the raids, never had the cushion of extra space or the time to recover that characterized the bombed-out cities of Europe.%3  The city, however, did not die the quick death that some Americans hoped it would. Instead, “the limitless acres of ruin seemed to spread everywhere, like a desert, in a drab and monotonous panorama of hopelessness.” As shelter burned, heating and electricity went out (even before March 10), food stocks diminished further, and sanitation systems fouled, a gradual but grim decline set in. The city’s experience was still another instance where air power’s promise of devastating shock, even in what was by many indices the war’s most devastating raid, trailed off into agonizingly slow attrition.  Even as death’s hand began gripping Tokyo, it reached out elsewhere. Emboldened by his success against Tokyo, LeMay immediately set out to repeat it. Giving his crews little pause lest the Japanese have time to regroup, he sent the bombers against Nagoya on the eleventh, and then in rapid succession against Osaka, Kobe, and Nagoya again. Yet the countless ingredients of the Tokyo holocaust could not be predictably reassembled. Attempting to widen the area of destruction, LeMay pressed his luck too far in spacing the distribution of incendiaries against Nagoya the first time, though eight square miles of Osaka soon disappeared in one raid. Weather affected success, though not always adversely: bad weather over Kobe forced crews to use radar, which enabled them to lay a more perfectly spaced carpet of bombs than visual methods usually achieved. On occasion Japanese defenses met their test a little better, and most of all, as news of Tokyo rapidly spread, abandon- ment of primitive shelters and attempts to fight fires, along with general flight from the cities, kept casualties down. Thousands more died, however, and millions were rendered homeless.  LeMay and his crews were
