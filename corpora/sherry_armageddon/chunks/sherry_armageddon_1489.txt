r test a little better, and most of all, as news of Tokyo rapidly spread, abandon- ment of primitive shelters and attempts to fight fires, along with general flight from the cities, kept casualties down. Thousands more died, however, and millions were rendered homeless.  LeMay and his crews were immensely satisfied. Losses were neglible and results spectacular, and whereas crew morale had seemed “ominous” before March 9, now cases of “personnel disorders” suddenly dropped almost to nothing, to the point that LeMay’s experts believed the crews could be “ ‘flown to death” without developing “ ‘escape behavior” (the maladies or excuses that took men out of action). But after ten days of blitzing Japan’s greatest cities, LeMay had to pause. Both fliers and ground personnel were exhausted, supplies of incendiary bombs had given out, and orders had come down to support the invasion of Okinawa—like Iwo Jima, an operation whose benefits for the air force and even bloodier consequences gave Arnold and Norstad no choice but to lend a hand. The stra- tegic campaign had to go on hold.  ASSESSMENT AND AFTERMATH  It seemed that LeMay had made one of the supremely important command decisions of the war, one that reversed the fortunes of a faltering air force, set the strategic course for the remainder of the war, and even cast the mold of postwar American air power as a weapon of strategic devastation against cities. As LeMay himself said in November 1945, his actions were “an example of the terrible responsibility upon the shoulders of a commander who must risk thousands of lives and perhaps the future of an entire campaign, or even an entire war and must in the final analysis make that decision himself.” Earlier, when the New Yorker published the first extended account of the March blitz, LeMay’s skillful public relations officer (and former New Yorker editor) portrayed LeMay’s role in even more sweeping terms: “LeMay had settled down to make a decision of the kind that this war
