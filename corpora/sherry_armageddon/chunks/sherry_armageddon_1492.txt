e May’s contacts with his superiors, Arnold and the air force had gotten the casual nod from their superiors, the Joint Chiefs and the president. Roosevelt had conveyed his interest in bombing Japan (and Tokyo in particular), though couching it largely in political terms, and he had been informed of the test fire raids, and then of the March 10 raid, but made no recorded inquiries.1° The Joint Chiefs had sanctioned preliminary plans that included the firebombing of cities but did not direct their preparation or monitor their progress. The destruction proceeded with accountability, beyond LeMay’s, poorly fixed.  And yet the destruction was hardly unintended or the outcome primarily of the operational considerations usually cited, for plans to firebomb had emerged well before some of the operational obstacles facing the Marianas bombers were even known. Just as telling an indication of the minimal role those obstacles played was the bomber’s record elsewhere in Asia.  Incendiary tactics similar to LeMay’s were employed against other Asian cities where the obstacles LeMay faced either did not arise or took very different form. The weather was less ferocious  Page 281 of 368 64%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON Japanese have time to regroup, he sent the bombers against Nagoya on the eleventh, and then 1n rapid succession against Osaka, Kobe, and Nagoya again. Yet the countless ingredients ot the Tokyo  holocaust could not be predictably reassembled. Attempting to widen the area of destruction, LeMay pressed his luck too far in spacing the distribution of incendiaries against Nagoya the first time, though eight square miles of Osaka soon disappeared in one raid. Weather affected success, though not always adversely: bad weather over Kobe forced crews to use radar, which enabled them to lay a more perfectly spaced carpet of bombs than visual methods usually achieved. On occasion Japanese defenses met their test a little better, and most of all,
