ted, though of course often missed, only if their relationship to the enemy war effort was demonstrably intimate. In Asia the criteria were far looser and their formulation did not even warrant review by heads of states or chiefs of services. There, a different set of standards applied not only to the enemy population, but to conquered friendly peoples as well.  Those standards measure the casual nature of the destruction that took place in Asia. They also suggest that bombing against Japan was shaped not simply by operational considerations or even by the enemy’s nature and the lust for revenge it aroused, but by the lower value Americans put on Asian lives whatever their nationality or allegiances. At best, the operational factors cited to justify firebombing Formosa were not compelling but only permissive. Nor did the destruction have the sanction of saving American lives that its counterpart in Japan did. By the spring of 1945, Formosa had been stricken from the list of American objectives for landing, and the gain in American lives came only in the modest attrition in Japanese war production (by then almost nullified anyway by de- struction of Formosan railways and shipping to Japan) and in the damage (largely by precision strikes on airfields) done to the fearsome kamikaze effort.  As for bombing the cities of Japan itself, the principal rationale was a vast feeder system of home shops and cottage industries that saturated workers’ residential areas and kept the main war industries supplied with parts. The existence and importance of this system ran through virtually every argument offered for incendiary raids against urban areas and was offered after the fact in justification. “I'll never forget Yokohama,” LeMay wrote after the war about the sights he saw in Japan. “That was what impressed me: drill presses. There they were, like a forest of scorched trees and stumps, growing up throughout that residential area.”1°4 With the main factories themselves hard to
