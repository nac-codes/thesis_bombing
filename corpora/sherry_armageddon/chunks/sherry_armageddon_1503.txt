eleven principal cities were almost completely destroyed, another four half ruined, with predictable casualties: 6,100 killed and thousands more wounded (by Japanese estimates which, if they followed the homeland pattern, were probably low), and over a quarter of a million people made homeless. The weaponry was the same as LeMay’s—at least 62,445 gallons of napalm. Against Chinese cities, area bombing apparently continued until for- bidden late in July 1945.10  The issue is not whether there were legitimate military targets in Formosa and China. There were and these were hit. Much more was hit. To some degree, the rationale was similar to the one used to justify the torching of Japan’s cities. As the official historians wrote, “So many of the significant targets of Formosa were situated in the island’s cities and towns that area bombing was frequently employed. The resulting destruction, it was assumed, not only would reach supplies of military importance and many small industrial units, but would impose upon the enemy, through destruction of housing and municipal services, a serious loss of labor.” But in this case the “municipal services” also supported friendly civilians, and the “serious loss of labor” was inflicted on the same population. The rationale for area bombing, it seemed, hardly need be confined to the enemy.10  Except for his mission against Hankow, this torch of destruction was not even wielded by LeMay. Falling to other air force commands, its systematic employment suggests again how much the decision LeMay made for the March 10 fire raid was not uniquely personal; he grasped a weapon others were free and encouraged to use as well. More than that, it suggests that racist assumptions guided bombing in Asia as much as operational considerations. To be sure, the cities of occupied Europe had often been bombed: thousands were killed in French and Belgian cities by Anglo-American bombers prior to and after OVERLORD. In part simply because the air war in
