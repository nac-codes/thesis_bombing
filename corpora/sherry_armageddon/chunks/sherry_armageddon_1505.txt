came only in the modest attrition in Japanese war production (by then almost nullified anyway by de- struction of Formosan railways and shipping to Japan) and in the damage (largely by precision strikes on airfields) done to the fearsome kamikaze effort.  As for bombing the cities of Japan itself, the principal rationale was a vast feeder system of home shops and cottage industries that saturated workers’ residential areas and kept the main war industries supplied with parts. The existence and importance of this system ran through virtually every argument offered for incendiary raids against urban areas and was offered after the fact in justification. “I’ll never forget Yokohama,” LeMay wrote after the war about the sights he saw in Japan. “That was what impressed me: drill presses. There they were, like a forest of scorched trees and stumps, growing up throughout that residential area.”!°4 With the main factories themselves hard to hit, the only method of disabling Japanese war production was to get those drill presses, and that could be done only with firebombing, so the rationale went.  The feeder system was indeed extensive and commented on by Japanese as a target whose destruction did serious damage to Japan’s war economy and thereby was implicitly justified.1° But its importance in 1945 was another matter altogether. Japan’s industrial economy, like that of every combatant, had undergone a concentration into larger enterprises to achieve economies of scale and reflect accompanying shifts in the location of economic power. Large numbers of men (by conscription) and women (by economic necessity) had been drawn into the factory system, and “the drift toward oligopoly,” Thomas Havens notes, saw “11,000 small shops forced to close in Tokyo alone by mid-1943.” Doubtless many of those were in the rapidly collapsing consumer sector, but as the Strategy Bombing Survey later concluded: “By 1944 the Japanese had almost eliminated home industry in their war economy.” Fac
