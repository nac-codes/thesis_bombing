s many of those were in the rapidly collapsing consumer sector, but as the Strategy Bombing Survey later concluded: “By 1944 the Japanese had almost eliminated home industry in their war economy.” Factories with fewer than 250 workers still played a vital role, but these were hardly backyard drill presses. Simply the well-known dispersal of war industry out of the cities made the cottage industries a less practical source of supply.1°  Beyond industrial concentration and relocation, other factors reduced the importance of the feeder system. The war plants it fed were themselves caught in a spiral of declining production, partly because of the direct destruction in some precision attacks and in area raids that spilled over onto them, even more because the lifeline of supplies from outside Japan was being strangled by American attacks on shipping. The attacks on Japanese cities hastened that decline, but LeMay’s bombers destroyed a feeder system that would soon have had few working factories to feed, killed or “dehoused” workers from factories whose machines were starting to go silent, and smashed plants whose chimneys were already going smokeless. In short, much of LeMay’s bombing simply made the rubble of Japan’s war economy bounce. Furthermore, by an economist’s standard the destruction achieved was an inefficient way to secure desired ends. Targeting housing, firebombing “hit what was physically the most vulnerable but socially the least effective component of a city,” for even in Japan housing was a relatively “elastic” commodity, improvised arrangements would work for a while, and few factories shut down because workers fled cities. Finally, other methods remained to still the factories and the feeder system. They were wholly dependent on electric power systems and (ex- cept for accumulated stocks) on rail transport and shipping lines; of those, only the last was the air force beginning to attack in the spring, and then only reluctantly.1°  So it appears in hind
