e answer, then, is that a good deal of knowledge was available and more could have been assembled. To be sure, some of it was only arriving in the spring of 1945, but as events that summer showed, it was often resisted by airmen asked to confront it. Much of it suggested the navy’s critical role in shutting down Japanese industry, a role airmen were reluctant to acknowledge. None of it directly addressed the harsh fact that operational limitations made precision bombing difficult, but incendiary attacks persisted after those difficulties moderated. LeMay and the air force had chosen  Page 284 of 368 65%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  PROPUT Cerne te CUPUUTULOCTS BUST OMUTUSV ERE YUILUT LOR CLOTCUTOFT RUT OOUTELOFET ETS FoROR ROT ar a aan CPE LUSSUTULOTTU RUT aEUUTOPELUUS LOCOTUTO CrUUULOTOTEY RUTTLOMESEOITTLOIVELUSS 1LOCUSTLOTETUT OR ETO ONTCrED Ly) AAU URE ke ed ed Ca By Uy eras, Had Cae ede  toward oligopoly,” Thomas Havens notes, saw “11,000 small shops forced to close in Tokyo alone by mid-1943.” Doubtless many of those were in the rapidly collapsing consumer sector, but as the Strategy Bombing Survey later concluded: “By 1944 the Japanese had almost eliminated home industry in their war economy.” Factories with fewer than 250 workers still played a vital role, but these were hardly backyard drill presses. Simply the well-known dispersal of war industry out of the cities made the cottage industries a less practical source of supply.1°°  Beyond industrial concentration and relocation, other factors reduced the importance of the feeder system. The war plants it fed were themselves caught in a spiral of declining production, partly because of the direct destruction in some precision attacks and in area raids that spilled over onto them, even more because the lifeline of supplies from outside Japan was being strangled by American attacks on shipping. The attacks on Japanese cities hastened that decline, but LeMay’s bombers destroyed a f
