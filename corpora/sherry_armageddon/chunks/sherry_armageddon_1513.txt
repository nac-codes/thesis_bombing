en more because the lifeline of supplies from outside Japan was being strangled by American attacks on shipping. The attacks on Japanese cities hastened that decline, but LeMay’s bombers destroyed a feeder system that would soon have had few working factories to feed, killed or “dehoused” workers from factories whose machines were starting to go silent, and smashed plants whose chimneys were already going smokeless. In short, much of LeMay’s bombing simply made the rubble of Japan’s war economy bounce. Furthermore, by an economist’s standard the destruction achieved was an inefficient way to secure desired ends. Targeting housing, firebombing “hit what was physically the most vulnerable but socially the least effective component of a city,” for even in Japan housing was a relatively “elastic” commodity, improvised arrangements would work for a while, and few factories shut down because workers fled cities. Finally, other methods remained to still the factories and the feeder system. They were wholly dependent on electric power systems and (ex- cept for accumulated stocks) on rail transport and shipping lines; of those, only the last was the air force beginning to attack in the spring, and then only reluctantly.1°  So it appears in hindsight, a luxury LeMay of course did not have. The question is whether it was known or could have been known at the time. Through increasingly sophisticated photographic intelligence and other sources, much was understood about the collapse of the Japanese merchant marine, and therefore the sharp decline in raw materials for factories. The decline in home industries was less visible, although American economists and intelligence experts had considerable insight into how war was changing industrial production in the major powers; even in the winter, air force experts had commented on the dispersal of Japanese industry out of the cities, begun in response to precision attacks and reducing the value of urban cottage industries.
