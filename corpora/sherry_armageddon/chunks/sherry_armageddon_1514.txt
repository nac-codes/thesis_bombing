winter, air force experts had commented on the dispersal of Japanese industry out of the cities, begun in response to precision attacks and reducing the value of urban cottage industries. Attacks on the German petroleum industry and other German economic objectives were already discrediting the value of incendiary attacks on cities there. And Hansell, among others, had already mounted a considerable case for the efficacy of precision attacks.  The answer, then, is that a good deal of knowledge was available and more could have been assembled. To be sure, some of it was only arriving in the spring of 1945, but as events that summer showed, it was often resisted by airmen asked to confront it. Much of it suggested the navy’s critical role in shutting down Japanese industry, a role airmen were reluctant to acknowledge. None of it directly addressed the harsh fact that operational limitations made precision bombing difficult, but incendiary attacks persisted after those difficulties moderated. LeMay and the air force had chosen a kind of bombing they could do best, without a compelling rationale for the economic benefits claimed.  What is striking is that so few in the air force asked questions. There had at least been some discussion and action about attacking Japanese shipping but virtually none about the changing structure and dynamics of Japanese industrial production. No one thought to check on whether the feeder system remained economically important or vulnerable to paralysis by less gruesome but still feasible methods. The legitimacy of it (and therefore its people) as a target was simply assumed.  Of course, an alternative bombing strategy, one that extended the blockade of oceanic shipping to all forms of transportation, would have been cruel in its own right, killing thousands when targets were in urban areas, accelerating Japan’s devastating decline in food stocks, and perhaps, if its effects had worked more slowly, prolonging the suffering of civilians and
