was often resisted by airmen asked to confront it. Much of it suggested the navy’s critical role in shutting down Japanese industry, a role airmen were reluctant to acknowledge. None of it directly addressed the harsh fact that operational limitations made precision bombing difficult, but incendiary attacks persisted after those difficulties moderated. LeMay and the air force had chosen a kind of bombing they could do best, without a compelling rationale for the economic benefits claimed.  What is striking is that so few in the air force asked questions. There had at least been some discussion and action about attacking Japanese shipping but virtually none about the changing structure and dynamics of Japanese industrial production. No one thought to check on whether the feeder system remained economically important or vulnerable to paralysis by less gruesome but still feasible methods. The legitimacy of it (and therefore its people) as a target was simply assumed.  Of course, an alternative bombing strategy, one that extended the blockade of oceanic shipping to all forms of transportation, would have been cruel in its own right, killing thousands when targets were in urban areas, accelerating Japan’s devastating decline in food stocks, and perhaps, if its effects had worked more slowly, prolonging the suffering of civilians and of Japanese and American soldiers. Still, there would have been a difference: less destruction. Malnutrition was occurring anyway—at most, it would have been worse. Factories shuttered but not destroyed could have been re-opened; malnourished but alive children and workers could be returned to health; isolated but uncharred cities could have revived.  Yet even if LeMay and his superiors had grasped the weakness of their economic argument for area attacks, it is doubtful that they would have acted differently. The momentum behind razing Japan’s cities had developed too long and too intensely to be arrested by the collapse of any one argument.
