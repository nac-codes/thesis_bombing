attacks, it is doubtful that they would have acted differently. The momentum behind razing Japan’s cities had developed too long and too intensely to be arrested by the collapse of any one argument. Others were available. If not the workers’ drill presses, then their contribution to the factory system would have justified attacking their lives and housing; or there would have been arguments for undermining the entire urban infrastructure of Japan or for creating class animosities and mob terror to corrode the enemy’s will to fight. Each of these justifications had already been voiced months or years before the March 9 raid. If each successively posited a more distant connection between what the worker did and what Japan needed to sustain war, such looseness would have bothered few, certainly not LeMay. In his opinion, expressed after the war, “There are no innocent civilians. It is their government and you are fighting a people, you are not trying to fight an armed force anymore. So it doesn’t bother me so much to be killing the so-called innocent bystanders.” Even if the “innocent bystanders,” in an atomic conflict, “might be entire nations that aren’t even at war,” that would be a situation which “bothers me,” but “it doesn’t change the picture of what you are trying to do any.”108  However, LeMay’s conscience could not rest with his claim for the totality of war and the legitimacy of anything that wins. To establish collective guilt, he pointed also to “the way they were treating their prisoners and their captured people,” a justification many Americans cited during the war. But his main justification, if pressed to a moral argument, was a classic one of moral reasoning about war, one that cannot be facilely dismissed—and one that turned 180 degrees away from the enemy civilian’s guilt, to claim instead a favor for him: “Actually I think it’s more immoral to use less force than necessary, than it is to use more. If you use less force, you kill off more of humani
