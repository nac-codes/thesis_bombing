was primarily visual, events that left little visual record tended to disappear. Perhaps the closest the newsreels came to spelling out the truth visually came in the scenes released in May of firebombed German cities.

One solution was the resort to a rhetoric of cost-benefit analysis, contrasting the B-29s’ strikingly low loss rates with stunning statistics: “1,200,000 factory workers ... made homeless” and “at least 100,000 man-months” of labor lost to Japan and “369,000,000 sq. ft. of highly industrialized land .. . leveled to ashes” in the Tokyo raid alone. Of course the human carnage was implicit in such statistics, but they kept the emphasis on the economic objectives of precision bombing. Of course there was no denial that incendiaries were t
