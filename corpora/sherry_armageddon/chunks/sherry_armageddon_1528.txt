d alone. Of course the human carnage was implicit in such statistics, but they kept the emphasis on the economic objectives of precision bombing. Of course there was no denial that incendiaries were the weapon and great conflagration the result, but incendiary attack was simply “the economical method of destroying the small industries in these areas... of bringing about their liquidation.”  When asked about “the reasoning behind this switch from explosives to incendiaries,” Norstad denied any switch because the mission still remained “the reduction of Japanese ability to produce war goods.” Even off the record he would not budge. Asked for “any idea how many civilians might have been effected [sic],” Norstad only repeated the figure on homeless. Was there any change in “the basic policy of the Air Forces in pin-point bombing [and] precision?” “None.” At the same time, Norstad stressed that the incendiary raids were just beginning; one thousand B-29s would soon fly whereas only three hundred had gone against Tokyo. Every Japanese city was deemed a legitimate target. Who would decide the limits of the forthcoming attacks? “The Japs will decide it”—that is, the raids would continue as long as “they can take it.”114  A few months later, McKelway’s article in the New Yorker nicely brought together the same contradictions maintained by Norstad. True, LeMay was prepared to see all of Japan’s cities “wiped right off the map.” At the same time, McKelway did not find it contradictory to say that the “incendiaries were dropped with precision.” McKelway also tried to distinguish LeMay’s methods from those of the RAF against Germany: “It was pin-point, incendiary bombing from a low level, designed not simply to start fires or destroy a single factory but to start one great conflagration whose fury would double and redouble the destructive force of the bombs.” It was hardly what most Americans understood by “pin-point, incendiary bombing,” but it was useful to keep repeating the
