tion whose fury would double and redouble the destructive force of the bombs.” It was hardly what most Americans understood by “pin-point, incendiary bombing,” but it was useful to keep repeating the phrase.115  In one sense, the media’s reporting of the March 10 raid seemingly stripped away the veneer of official obfuscation. Certainly the raid received due play, given “eight column banners” in great metropolitan newspapers, as the AAF public relations officers proudly noted.116 Often, coverage was also graphic. New York Times headlines proclaimed that “300 B-29’s FIRE 15 SQUARE MILES OF TOKYO,” hitting “Thickly Populated Center of Big City.” A day later, the Times’s headline drove home the same message: “CENTER OF TOKYO DEVASTATED BY FIRE BOMBS,” with “CITY’s HEART GONE.” The Times described precisely the density and size of the area hit and invited readers to imagine the destruction of a comparable area in New York City. Readers were told of the “jellied gasoline” used and were given a vivid report by a correspondent who accompanied the mission: “I not only saw Tokyo burning furiously in many sections, but I smelled it.” And though given no figures by the air force, the Times at least ac- knowledged that the civilian toll constituted “a holocaust.”117  Yet there were limits on what press coverage could communicate. In lieu of good film footage, newsreel companies were first forced to show only stateside tests of napalm bombs. Later newsreels conveyed verbally the message of Tokyo’s destruction, but pictures were usually confined to the better-quality footage available for day raids. In that sense, the historical void into which the Tokyo conflagration fell was not created simply by the nature of the atomic attacks: for the media whose message was primarily visual, events that left little visual record tended to disappear. Perhaps the closest the newsreels came to spelling out the truth visually came in the scenes released in May of firebombed German cities. Even
