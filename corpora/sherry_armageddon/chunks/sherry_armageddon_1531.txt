particularly the role of air power in the postwar world. With the battle over postwar unification of the armed forces heating up, that role was ripe material for commentary. The more expansive view was that the Twentieth Air Force showed the way to the “future global air power upon which American security will proportionately rest” and through which the nation would achieve “realistic world influence.”112  Amid these commercial and political preferences, little inclination was left for pondering what happened on the ground in Japan. If noted at all, loss of enemy life was sometimes mentioned with passing regret, but also the reminder that “Tokyo is a prime military target, so recognized under the rules of war and... civilians remain there to man Japan’s armament industries at their own peril.” More often, the attacks were just described as “the bombing of factories and plants,” undertaken against “a fanatical foe prepared to fight to the death.” The New York Herald Tribune followed a more tortured path around the humanitarian issue. “Any impression that precision bombing is abandoned by the 20th [Air Force] should be corrected.” It was simply the case that Japan’s “unique in- dustrial set-up ... makes area bombing necessary.” Anyway, “the incendiary raids cause little loss of life but drive inhabitants into the country and destroy their industrial utility.”12°  Only the vengeful (plus a handful in left-wing, religious, and pacifist journals) acknowledged bluntly the scale of human destruction. The Atlanta Constitution, finding it “shocking to think of the thousands who must be burned to death,” wrongly characterized the fatalities as unavoidable by-products that can occur even in “the most perfect precision bombing.” Still, the paper also took satisfaction:  If it is necessary, however, that the cities of Japan are, one by one, burned to black ashes, that we can, and will, do.  And with each city thus attacked, we remember the treachery of Pearl Harbor and find cal
