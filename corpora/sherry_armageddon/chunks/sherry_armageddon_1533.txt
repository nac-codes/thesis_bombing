the “jellied gasoline” used and were given a vivid report by a correspondent who accompanied the mission: “I not only saw Tokyo burning furiously in many sections, but I smelled it.” And though given no figures by the air force, the Times at least ac- knowledged that the civilian toll constituted “a holocaust.”117  Yet there were limits on what press coverage could communicate. In lieu of good film footage, newsreel companies were first forced to show only stateside tests of napalm bombs. Later newsreels conveyed verbally the message of Tokyo’s destruction, but pictures were usually confined to the better-quality footage available for day raids. In that sense, the historical void into which the Tokyo conflagration fell was not created simply by the nature of the atomic attacks: for the media whose message was primarily visual, events that left little visual record tended to disappear. Perhaps the closest the newsreels came to spelling out the truth visually came in the scenes released in May of firebombed German cities. Even that footage showed only the still aftermath of destruction, not the act of destruction itself. Perhaps the lack of good photographs also led Life to give the fire raids little play. As always there was a preference for action pictures whose heroic or grisly content was immediate. One consequence was continued attention to men and planes, not to the destruction they did on the ground; even Japanese newsreels featured the brave handfuls of fighter pilots still ris- ing to meet the enemy hordes.
