re too mammoth to be stopped; kamikazes were almost useless against the B-29s, Japan's worst scourge; and fanatical resistance might only harden the enemy’s attitude. Yet American losses to kamikazes were indeed appalling (so much so that the American government wrapped them in censorship). Coming when American “war-weariness” was already pronounced, when leaders like Marshall wondered if the nation would even stay the course, the kamikaze attacks may well have had the desired effect.123 Without the threat of greater losses in invasion they seemed to prophesy, it is doubtful that American leaders would ever have compromised on the critical issue of the imperial throne, on whose preservation Japan’s civilian leaders pinned hopes for their continued role in Japanese life.  But if successful in this way, suicide tactics worked at a great price: countless servicemen’s deaths on both sides and the continued exposure of Japan’s cities to destruction while the tactics were given time to work. Drawing on deeply rooted cultural notions of Japanese purity and outsiders’ defilement of it, government propaganda now spoke of “the shattering of the hundred million like a beautiful jewel.” As one historian has summed up the mood instilled in Japanese as the bombing climaxed, “The supreme sacrifice and ultimate state of purification, by this terrible logic, had finally come to mean readiness to embrace extermination.” “The ‘national polity’ took precedence over the people,” concludes another historian.124 In any calculus of blame for the destruction of Japan’s cit- ies, its leaders figured alongside America’s, just as Germany’s did in the case of its destruction.  On the American side, too, leaders reacted cautiously to new possibilities. Age was no barrier to Stimson’s realization of the atomic bomb’s novelty, which he had conveyed to Roosevelt and now made emphatic to Truman: “The world in its present state of moral advancement compared with its technical development would be eve
