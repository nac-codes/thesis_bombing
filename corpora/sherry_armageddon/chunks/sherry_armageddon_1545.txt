the atomic bomb’s novelty, which he had conveyed to Roosevelt and now made emphatic to Truman: “The world in its present state of moral advancement compared with its technical development would be eventually at the mercy of such a weapon. In other words, modern civilization might be completely destroyed.” Yet Stimson still did not connect the issue for mankind raised by the bomb with the immediate conduct of the war against Japan. He and most others who thought about the bomb overlooked the moral issue at hand and its connection to the larger matter of mankind’s fate: the possibility that the bomb’s use against Japan might establish a precedent for future use and intensify an international arms race. That connection was suggested only by those on the fringes of nuclear policy, among the Chicago scientists, and by that somewhat mysterious gadfly to Roosevelt, Alexander Sachs.125  As Stimson later suggested, no one at his level questioned the assumption that the bomb would and could be used against the enemy: “At no time, from 1941 to 1945, did I ever hear it suggested by the President, or by any other responsible member of the government, that atomic energy should not be used in the war. ... The entire purpose was the production of a military weapon; on no other ground could the wartime expenditure of so much time and money have been justified.” And yet Stimson’s recollections on this point were confusing, for he also claimed that “the first and greatest problem was the decision on the use of the bomb—should it be used against the Japanese, and if so, in what manner?” Clearly, given unquestioned acceptance of the bomb’s use, any “decision” about use was no decision at all.
