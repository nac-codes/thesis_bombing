On both sides, officials were aloof to the destruction, glimpsed few dramatic possibilities in the bombing, and worked through cumbersome bureaucracies responding slowly to changing conditions. Circumstances of the moment also delayed quick response. Leadership changed on both sides in April, with the fall of Koiso’s government and Roosevelt’s death; cautious men searched for their footing in the new political terrain.
