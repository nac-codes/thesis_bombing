y in the spring of 1945, he had extracted a “promise from [Assistant Secretary for Air Robert] Lovett that there would be only precision bombing in Japan.” Despite the March 10 and subsequent fire raids, he remained convinced as late as May 16, as he told Truman, that he was holding the air force, “so far as possible, to the ‘precision’ bombing [of Japan] which it has done so well in Europe.” It seemed important to do so because “the reputation of the United States for fair play and humanitarianism is the world’s biggest asset for peace in the coming decades.” Similar rules for “sparing the civilian population,” he added, to Truman, “should be applied as far as possible to the use of any new weapon,” that is, the atomic bomb.127  Stimson convinced himself that “precision” bombing remained American practice in part through unwillingness to confront the contrary evidence in the press and to penetrate the transparent distinctions about targeting offered by the air force. After the war he wrote: “In March, 1945, our Air Force had launched the first great incendiary raid on the Tokyo area. In this raid more damage was done and more casualties were inflicted than was the case at Hiroshima.” But there is no evidence that Stimson at the time appreciated the magnitude of the March 10 raid, unless it provided him the spur to approach Lovett—if so, he did not note it at the time. To the contrary, only the renewed fire raids on Tokyo at the end of May caught his attention and led him to query Arnold about “my promise  Page 292 of 368 67%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON future use and intensify an international arms race. That connection was suggested only by those on the fringes of nuclear policy, among the Chicago scientists, and by that somewhat mysterious gadfly to Roosevelt, Alexander Sachs.125  As Stimson later suggested, no one at his level questioned the assumption that the bomb would and could be used against the enemy: “At no time, from 1941
