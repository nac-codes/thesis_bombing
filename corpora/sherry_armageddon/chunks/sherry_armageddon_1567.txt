particularly in assessing the possibilities for peace opened by establishment of the “moderate” Suzuki cabinet. Intelligence estimates undertaken at Marshall's urging in April were emphatic: “There are no indications that the Japanese as a whole share the fanatical Nazi psychology of committing national sui- cide,” nor did “any important Japanese leaders,” who anyway had “adhered to their established constitutional procedures.”123  The obstacles to early surrender seemed formidable but not insoluble. They consisted less of the unconditional surrender formula itself than of the Allied failure to interpret it in a way allowing Japan to save face and preserve the imperial institution as well as the effective use made in Japanese propaganda of bloodcurdling statements by some Americans.about the wisdom of extermination. It seemed possibile that “clarification of Allied intentions,” particularly to the effect that “unconditional surrender does not imply annihilation or national suicide,” would hasten Japan's capitulation. So too might news of Germany’s defeat and Russia’s entry into the war. Furthermore, capitulation might occur before invasion had to take place, perhaps even before the final demolition of Japan’s cities, especially if some air effort was shifted to Japan’s “limited and vulnerable internal and external lines of communication.” Moreover, intelligence experts suggested, a compromise on the emperor's fate might have to be accepted eventually, for otherwise an orderly surrender and occupation would be impossible. The problem, they recognized, was no longer one of inflicting defeat or even a realization of defeat among Japanese—both had been accomplished by April. The problem was one largely unexamined in the annals of military theory and history: how military force could translate defeat into surrender. Guardedly, the military experts indicated there was really no military solution for such a problem except for an invasion that might command alarmingly low s
