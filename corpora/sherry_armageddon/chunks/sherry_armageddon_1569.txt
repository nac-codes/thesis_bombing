ake a psychological impression on the enemy, Stimson and many officers opposed more forthright overtures while the bloody Okinawa campaign hung in the balance, lest they be interpreted as signs of weakness. Political leaders also still feared popular reaction to any promises about an emperor whom Americans had been taught to hate. Inasmuch as the battle for Okinawa dragged on into June, the proper moment for approaching Japan was grievously delayed.13©  Without refinement of surrender terms, strategists saw little choice but to plan on applying every kind of force against Japan: conventional bombing, use of the atomic bomb, Soviet entry into the war, and of course invasion. Such a broad-front strategy conformed to the dictates of service unity and to the studied caution of military leadership; it was also compelled by the political vacuum in which strategists found themselves.
