munication.” Moreover, intelligence experts suggested, a compromise on the emperor’s fate might have to be accepted eventually, for otherwise an orderly surrender and occupation would be impossible. The problem, they recognized, was no longer one of inflicting defeat or even a realization of defeat among Japanese—both had been accomplished by April. The problem was one largely unexamined in the annals of military theory and history: how military force could translate defeat into surrender. Guardedly, the military experts indicated there was really no military solution for such a problem except for an invasion that might command alarmingly low support from soldiers, who would see invasion as a “struggle simply to dethrone the emperor or give Admiral William F. ‘Bull’ Halsey his vaunted ride through Tokyo on the emperor’s white horse.”134  But problems immediately arose in translating these realizations into a working policy. Against unprovable theorems about Japan’s future behavior was set the brutal reality of its current fanaticism. Experts themselves were divided about the best military course to accompany political strategy; army representatives still insisted on invasion, about which naval and air officers were dubious while disagreeing about the kinds of bombardment and blockade which would achieve success. These differences might have become a moot point if a change in political strategy had been aggressively pursued, but despite Marshall’s backing for it, the State Department balked at change. The new president, in his V-E Day address, had reaffirmed that unconditional surrender “does not mean the extermination or enslavement of the Japanese people.” By stating that it also meant “termination of the influence of ... military leaders,” he also implied that civilians like the emperor might escape punishment. Broadcasting to Japan, the navy’s psychological warfare experts tried to relay Truman's message, though the American voice was hardly a consistent one.135
