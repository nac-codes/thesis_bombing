Broadcasting to Japan, the navy’s psychological warfare experts tried to relay Truman's message, though the American voice was hardly a consistent one.135  After that promising start, the new political strategy stalled again. To avoid confrontation with the State Department, Marshall had “put the question of surrender terms on the treacherous ground of psychological warfare.” If their objective was to make a psychological impression on the enemy, Stimson and many officers opposed more forthright overtures while the bloody Okinawa campaign hung in the balance, lest they be interpreted as signs of weakness. Political leaders also still feared popular reaction to any promises about an emperor whom Americans had been taught to hate.
