caution of military leadership; it was also compelled by the political vacuum in which strategists found themselves. Any attempt to be selective depended on articulation of a political strategy at the highest level, as one staff committee realized: “Unless a definition of unconditional surrender can be given which is acceptable to the Japanese, there is no alternative to annihilation and no prospect that the threat of absolute defeat will bring about capitulation. The accomplishment of the unconditional surrender objectives then must be entirely brought about by force of arms.”!3” In short, plans for invasion had to go forward. For the bombing effort the implications were perhaps less clear. But whereas revision of the surrender formula might have sanctioned resort to a more limited attack on lines of communication, the prospect of invasion justified the systematic destruction of all components of Japan’s strength, including its cities.  The air force prepared to follow up on LeMay’s March successes with little direction from the top and little initiative of its own to refine surrender strategy. To the extent that any such strategy emerged at all, it was more the product than the cause of LeMay’s March 10 spectacular. Arnold certainly hoped that bombing alone might end the war, but as usual, his emphasis was on achieving “the maximum weight of effective bombs on Japanese targets” with the intent of destroying “whole industrial cities.” It was left to others to translate that effort into a scheme for victory.138  It was spelled out by Arnold’s staff. Further bombing delivered when Germany collapsed might “bring home the futility of continuing the war” to Japan’s masses and leaders. Furthermore, Germany’s surrender “might offer Japan’s leaders a face-saving basis to end the war” as well as alarm them at the prospect of quick Russian entry into the Asian war. These possibilities, along with some shrewd analysis from army intelligence about the Suzuki cabinet, flowed i
