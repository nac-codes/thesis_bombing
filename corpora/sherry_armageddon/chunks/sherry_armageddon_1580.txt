with how the United States—not always, but at its worst—waged the war.143  Page 297 of 368 68%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON such conception beyond trying to apply “maximum pressure on the Japanese Empire by increasing the sortie rate and bomb load,” as he put it to Arnold on April 5. After the war, he described his  firebombing as having “whipped the populace into a state where they could—and would—accept the idea of surrender.” At the time, LeMay and his staff developed no clear rationale even for that strategy. Youth, inexperience, and his place in the chain of command perhaps discouraged LeMay from connecting his operations to the final goal of victory. And yet Eaker and Spaatz, though senior in age and experience, held comparable commands in Europe and on occasion spoke out forcefully on larger strategic and political issues. The difference lay partly in LeMay’s mentality, partly in his unique position as subordinate to Arnold: if not to LeMay, then articulation of strategy fell to Arnold, but he had little interest. To both, converting destruction into surrender was a job for superiors in the chain of command. LeMay’s job was to destroy targets. The airmen’s hope to prove the B-29s’ war-winning capacity was not pressed on higher authority. That hope remained, as the official history put it, “not for public consumption.”14°  LeMay was sent off to destroy more cities without a clear rationale for doing so. The air staff was hedging its bets: “If the . .. incendiary attacks do not weaken the morale of the Japanese people” so that they “terminate the war,” they would in any event prepare the way for “invasion and the ultimate defeat of Japan.” In short, if bombing did not win the war one way, it would another, and there seemed neither sanction nor compulsion from higher authority to choose. Some air staff officers chafed at this vagueness, but to little avail.141  So LeMay pressed on. In April he launched only a few major fire raids,
