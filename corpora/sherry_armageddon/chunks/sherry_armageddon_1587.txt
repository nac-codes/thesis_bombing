the raids acted only as another catalyst to the more urgent pursuit of Soviet mediation, though by now Foreign Minister Togo bluntly emphasized the futility of that course. Nor did formal military strategy take a new turn. It remained harnessed to the hope, belligerently expressed but deeply doubted, that fanatical resistance on land and at sea would force the enemy to compromise on peace terms. Invasion, not air raids, would decide Japan’s fate.* But the raids’ impact could not be measured only by formal policy. Given the capacity of Japan’s “peace” faction to feel intimidated by die-hard militarists, that policy changed only at a glacial pace. Almost an unmentionable shame, the destruction of the imperial quarters produced a reaction played out less in words than in solemn ritual, particularly the many attempts to resign office. As Kido’s diary indi- cated, in court circles the May raids drove home Japan’s hopelessness in a visceral way that no other event of these last months could match.  For the short term at least, these raids also played into the hands of the die-hards. Some of its American proponents had hoped that a direct attack on the emperor would destroy his divine mystique in the eyes of the Japanese masses and thereby crush their last remaining reason for persisting in the struggle. That possibility had been on Norstad’s mind back in December, and publicly even the Christian Century, among many voices, had speculated that the great March 10 raid had “blasted large cracks in the myth by which a weak and inoffensive little man had become a conquering god.”6 But the May raids, coupled with the emperor’s show of compassion after the March 10 firestorm, seemed only to strengthen his bond with the populace.
