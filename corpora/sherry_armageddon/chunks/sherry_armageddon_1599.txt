In Newsweek, Raymond Moley proposed “to drive a wedge between the emperor and the people on one side, and the military class on the other,” noting that “the profound devotion of the Japanese people to the emperor is the root of the suicidal trend.” Moreover, Moley hoped that the political process could be speeded up if “through intensified bombing the panicky streak in the Japanese mentality may be set off.”2  Here was a stirring of interest in how the bombing might serve American purposes in a way more discrete than simply by piling up further destruction. Bolder speculation seemed out of place: the political effects of bombing were already rather discredited and almost unfathomable anyway in Japan’s case; it seemed risky to force the president’s hand in public at such a delicate moment and dangerous to nourish false hopes among Americans, all the more so since journalists shared official fears that Japan would exploit such hopes to no good purpose.
