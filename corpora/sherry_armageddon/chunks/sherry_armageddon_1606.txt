the media generally treated the bombing as a routine matter disconnected from the question of surrender. A veiled implication of an early peace appeared in LeMay’s public statement that “in a few months we will be running out of targets.” but the press did not follow it up. In commentaries linking bombing to surrender, the most frequent focus was on the possibility of starving Japan into surrender, a scenario recognized as unlikely to yield early results. Coverage of LeMay’s operations also rarely went beyond the usual official statements to evoke its full horror. Just as rare was the hint of criticism evident in a Time article describing LeMay’s blasting of Hitachi just two days after Halsey’s fleet had raked it with gunfire: the city “had long been on their [the airmen’s] list of targets and they had bombed it regardless of what Halsey’s guns might have done.” Perfunctory reporting on Japanese charges that American bombers “massacred innocent women and children” raised a moral issue only to dismiss it by asserting either the dishonesty or the hypocrisy of Japanese accusations. The New York Times’s Drew Middleton raised the issue in far more broad terms after viewing Berlin’s rubble: “The end of Western urban civilization is no longer an empty phrase but a terrible fact already within the grasp of mankind.” That danger, much debated during the infancy of air power, engaged few in 1945 until the atomic bomb invited a new perspective.16  Some peculiar circumstances that summer aggravated the long-standing difficulties in grasping the reality of bombing. LeMay’s first fire raids, in the spring, had been few in number and launched against Japan’s largest cities. After the last Tokyo raids, the trail of destruction ran mostly through unknown towns with unpronounceable names, evoking not even the hazy images that “Tokyo” or “Osaka” might trigger. In contrast to LeMay’s routine operations, the shelling and bombing by Halsey’s fleet, though far less weighty and destructiv
