ged support for Marshall’s Kyushu plan to the acquisition of vast new bases there from which to hit Japan. Clearly those bases would be ready only sometime in 1946, but lacking a plan to end the war earlier, he needed the Kyushu bases.  After the war, Arnold proclaimed his wartime confidence that air power could win the war. At the time, he had no clear idea how or when that would happen. Though given a September 1 victory date by LeMay, he made no concerted case for it. Later, at Potsdam, Arnold hinted at it, maintaining that by then Japan “will have tremendous difficulty in holding her people together for continued resistance to our terms of unconditional surrender.” But of course that was arguably the case even in July, and Arnold backed away from a more emphatic prediction. Even in early August, when LeMay’s campaign had proceeded further, Arnold suggested to the other Joint Chiefs that bombing might soon win the war, but it “in any event, will assure the success of the land campaign in Japan, and reduce the loss of American lives to a minimum.”2!  Arnold had interest in Washington’s June 18 deliberations. The next day, by teletype, he anxiously queried his Pentagon staff about the results: “Do the people in Washington realize that the bombing of Japan—the shortening of war—the saving of American lives all are dependent to some extent on this organization [?]” There was of course a strategic issue tucked away in Arnold’s question, but characteristically it was left subordinate to attainment of the recognition Arnold craved and the reorganization of air power he desired. The latter he eventually got in modified form—late in July, the Twentieth Air Force headquarters moved to the Marianas, and Spaatz (with LeMay as chief of staff) headed a new U.S. Army Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific embracing both the Twentieth and Eighth air forces. But in strategic matters, all had not gone well for the air force, either at the meeting with Truman on the eighteenth or the
