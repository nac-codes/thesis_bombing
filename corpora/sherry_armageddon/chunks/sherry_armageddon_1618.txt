Joint Chiefs that bombing might soon win the war, but it “in any event, will assure the success of the land campaign in Japan, and reduce the loss of American lives to a minimum.”2!  Arnold had interest in Washington’s June 18 deliberations. The next day, by teletype, he anxiously queried his Pentagon staff about the results: “Do the people in Washington realize that the bombing of Japan—the shortening of war—the saving of American lives all are dependent to some extent on this organization [?]” There was of course a strategic issue tucked away in Arnold’s question, but characteristically it was left subordinate to attainment of the recognition Arnold craved and the reorganization of air power he desired. The latter he eventually got in modified form—late in July, the Twentieth Air Force headquarters moved to the Marianas, and Spaatz (with LeMay as chief of staff) headed a new U.S. Army Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific embracing both the Twentieth and Eighth air forces. But in strategic matters, all had not gone well for the air force, either at the meeting with Truman on the eighteenth or the next day, when LeMay made his pitch to the Joint Chiefs and Marshall slept through it (so LeMay recalled).22  Another opportunity to reformulate strategy arose when Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) experts returned from Europe and made their recommendations for a final course of bombing against Japan. USSBS staff held several conferences with strategists in mid-June, including a meeting on the nineteenth with Stimson, Grew, Lovett, and Marshall. Hedged only by acknowledgment that the German and Japanese cases were not the same, the survey’s recommendations constituted a firm plea, based on lessons from Europe, to change LeMay’s targeting. The bombers should concentrate on Japanese transportation: the oceangoing fleet had disappeared, but railways and coastal shipping seemed prime targets whose destruction would paralyze the Japanese economy even if remaining factories and c
