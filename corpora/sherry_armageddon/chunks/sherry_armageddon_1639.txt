have to be found, and it was doubtful that transportation alone could absorb all the capacity. Operations analysts proposed moving on to “all urban areas with a population greater than 30,000 peoples,” some 180 towns in all. They could be wiped out by November, when, it was said, “the back of Japan thus will have been completely broken,” as if it was not already and as if planners had no idea of effecting earlier surrender. Another possibility lay in new methods of starvation to supplement the interdiction of food transport: the rice paddies might be sprayed with oil, defoliants, or biological agents, and the production of fertilizer further attacked. Because such a campaign would be slow to work its effects, it elicited a doubtful response from some air planners, but given the disappearance of other targets, the air force probably would have implemented it had the war continued into 1946.33  The use of gas was also pondered, for old restraints were slipping away: FDR, committed at least in public against American use, was dead; Germany’s surrender removed the threat of retaliation against European allies (though not against the Chinese), and the toll of American soldiers and sailors in Pacific combat was mounting. Arnold probably had gas in mind in May 1945 when he asked Eaker to ferret out any “Buck Rogers’ ideas” that would effect “Extermination of by-passed Jap Garrisons in [the] South Pacific,” though Arnold did not spell out why extermination was needed. Marshall apparently considered using gas, though perhaps only of a nonlethal variety, against those garrisons and in landing operations planned to follow Okinawa. If nothing else, it also seemed advantageous to make the Japanese think the Americans might employ gas in urban bombing raids, providing a “tremendous psychological effect on an already jittery populace” that might make it “crack” before invasion had to occur. Nonetheless, the services were not yet at the brink of initiating chemical warfare: popular
