ustrial capacity probably declined only by a marginal amount as a result of the summer’s area bombing; only a systematic attack on coastal shipping and inland transportation could have significantly magnified the economic paralysis caused by blockade and the initial spring fire raids. Of course the Japanese economy was sheared in so manv wavs that measuring the effect of one kind of destruction is difficult. But in economic terms the summer's fire attacks largelv inflicted redundant destruction and missed those components of  Page 309 of 368 70%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  een ane eg cee ey ence ee NE ER Ly RR ee a SS ie eS a i ty Se a eg EES Ee OO SR Ey tebe. 4 ER SS See et  even if implemented, Hansell’s favored transportation strategy would have been only marginally more discriminate in its treatment of civilians: with the impulse to kill so widely shared, the nature of target selection made only limited difference. So too did the tactical potentialities of the various forces involved. Even though B-29s were clearly best equipped for incendiary raids, other bombers sometimes resorted to the same tactics against Kyushu. “It seemed,” commented the official history, that the tactical forces “were prepared to obliterate whatever the B-29’s may have left of Japan’s urban centers.”32  Summer plans for future bombing campaigns, those not carried out because of the war’s sudden end, measured the widening circles of the destructive impulse. When the last cities were finished off, targets would still have to be found, and it was doubtful that transportation alone could absorb all the capacity. Operations analysts proposed moving on to “all urban areas with a population greater than 30,000 peoples,” some 180 towns in all. They could be wiped out by November, when, it was said, “the back of Japan thus will have been completely broken,” as if it was not already and as if planners had no idea of effecting earlier surrender.
