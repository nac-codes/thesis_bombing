depression, and anger still did not add up to an immediate threat to the government or constitute the lever Americans could work to effect surrender. The key to capitulation still lay in the machinations of court circles, to whom the danger remained subtle: the venting of pent-up anger against the elites when the inevitable surrender came and a newer prospect, that the masses might lack the strength or will to support any fight to the finish. As official reports noted with uncharacteristic bluntness, “The people are losing confidence in their leaders and the gloomy omen of deterioration in public morale is present,” Here was ammunition, used only cautiously, for the peace faction, and later a source of its hope that surrender would not be resisted once it came. The American attack on Japanese morale was having its effect, although as with most of bombing’s results, in circuitous ways.42  Finally there was the added human carnage of the summer, a tangible matter hopefully more precisely measurable than morale and public opinion. But no reliable figure exists, either for the summer raids or for the entire bombing campaign. The survey’s own claims for that campaign differed wildly, ranging from 268,157 to 900,000 killed. If near the latter figure, a minimum of 100,000, and probably far more, died in the war’s forgotten raids, especially the dozens of area raids on smaller cities during the summer. Though the death count of March 10 was never repeated in later fire raids, a gruesome toll still mounted because so many raids took place even as each inflicted relatively few fatalities. Whatever the total, it was only a fraction of the war-related civilian deaths (excluding those by extermination) suffered by some warring nations, particularly China and the Soviet Union, where perhaps 900,000 died in Leningrad’s siege alone. It was probably comparable to German deaths from air raids. Weighed against Japanese battle deaths, however, it probably means that more Japanese civi
