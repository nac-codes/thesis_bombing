tragically demonstrated in the final deliberations upon the atomic bomb, for in them the bomb’s use was never seriously debated and its destructive consequences were barely examined. Truman did agree in May to the establishment of the Interim Committee to consider issues raised by the bomb’s development. But though its decisions were crucial, it was never charged with weighing whether to use the atomic bomb against Japan, only with how its use would affect the many problems of domestic and international control of atomic energy sure to arise. One member, James Conant, later claimed that the bomb’s use against Japan was “the most important matter” on which the committee rendered judgment. But that matter was never formally on its agenda.48  The committee’s composition and its relationship to the rest of the policymaking community further weakened its attention to the bomb’s employment against Japan. Stimson chaired the committee, with his trusted aides Harvey Bundy and George Harrison doing much to shape its agenda and speed its workings. State was represented by its new secretary-designate, Jimmy Byrnes, and by Assistant Secretary Will Clayton, and navy by Under Secretary Ralph Bard. Three barons of science were also represented—Conant, Vannevar Bush, and Karl T. Compton—and attached to the committee was a scientific panel comprised of Oppenheimer, Lawrence, Arthur Compton, and Enrico Fermi, all men involved with the bomb’s development. None of these men, except Bard and Stimson in limited ways, was responsible for or familiar with military operations against Japan. By “invitation,” Marshall and Groves did attend many committee meetings, but establishment of a military panel was never carried out, and even as conceived it included no air force officer. Likewise, again with Stimson and Marshall as exceptions, committee members had not been involved in the formulation of surrender strategy.  Skewed by composition, the committee was also insulated by operation. Beyond
