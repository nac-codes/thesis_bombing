Oppenheimer had turned to discussing the bomb’s “visual effect” after noting that the result of “one atomic bomb on an arsenal would not be much different from the effect caused by any Air Corps strike of present dimensions.” At the same meeting, Groves had offered as one reason against making several simultaneous atomic strikes the assertion that the “effect would not be sufficiently distinct from our regular Air Force bombing program.” Earlier, the Target Committee had been firmly told, in words that hinted almost at a rivalry between the nuclear and incendiary bombers, that the Twentieth Air Force had “the prime purpose in mind of not leaving one stone lying on another.” It was “laying waste all the main Japanese cities,” and its commanders “do not propose to save some important primary target for us if it interferes with the operation of the war from their point of view.” If the atomic bomb had little to add in the way of carnage and rubble except its singular efficiency, attention naturally turned to other dimensions of its novelty.5®  The apparent similarity between atomic bombing and firebombing caused anxiety as well as uncertainty, a fear that the incendiary attacks would eliminate the virgin targets needed to rev
