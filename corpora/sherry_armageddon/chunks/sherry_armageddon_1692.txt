morality here, when it is a question of degree, not a question of kind?” It was a good question from a very obscure project worker whose superiors left little record indicating that they raised it. Indeed, given that most high-level officials comprehended the firebombing so inadequately and indifferently, it could not have served as a point of departure for reasoning about the bomb.*!  Furthermore, the claim that the atomic bomb saved the Japanese from the horror of continued fire raids was loose indeed, leaving unclear whether Japan was saved from a day’s fire raids or a month’s or a year’s. The calculus of alternative carnage was haphazard. It rested on unprovable assumptions that without use of the bomb the war would have continued for some lengthy period and on confidence—which most of the bomb’s managers refrained from claiming they had—that the bomb’s use would terminate the war quickly. It also rested on the assumption that without employment of the bomb, the Twentieth Air Force would have inflicted an unending succession of holocausts on the Tokyo model. But March 10 was not a repeatable success. It would have required many dozens of incendiary raids to inflict a death toll comparable to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. To be sure, only a handful of fire raids would have piled up a similar record of destroyed urban acreage but without the same loss of life.  Clearly there was something different about nuclear weapons. The comparisons to firebombing later made to justify use of the atomic bomb revealed the difficulty scientists and politicians had in grasping that difference. Nuclear weapons had peculiar consequences, radiation and fallout, whose insidious and persistent potential the bomb’s managers understood poorly. But the bomb’s uniqueness lay less in its lethality, either immediate or lasting, than in the certainty of its effects. An incendiary fire-storm, its creation so dependent on the vagaries of both man’s and nature’s behav- ior, was not predictably repea
