It also rested on the assumption that without employment of the bomb, the Twentieth Air Force would have inflicted an unending succession of holocausts on the Tokyo model. But March 10 was not a repeatable success. It would have required many dozens of incendiary raids to inflict a death toll comparable to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. To be sure, only a handful of fire raids would have piled up a similar record of destroyed urban acreage but without the same loss of life.  Clearly there was something different about nuclear weapons. The comparisons to firebombing later made to justify use of the atomic bomb revealed the difficulty scientists and politicians had in grasping that difference. Nuclear weapons had peculiar consequences, radiation and fallout, whose insidious and persistent potential the bomb’s managers understood poorly. But the bomb’s uniqueness lay less in its lethality, either immediate or lasting, than in the certainty of its effects. An incendiary fire-storm, its creation so dependent on the vagaries of both man’s and nature’s behav- ior, was not predictably repeatable. It also could not erupt without some warning to its victims. It was a kind of planned accident, like “a hole in one in a game of golf,” as Freeman Dyson said.  The atomic holocaust was a planned certainty. Of course, no one knew the thing would work until it did, and depending on just how and where it was delivered its effect might be marginally raised or lowered. (Hence the bomb’s managers pondered whether surrounding hills might focus the blast or low-level detonation might create radioactive dust or explosion in a rainstorm blanket the surrounding area with fallout.) But o
