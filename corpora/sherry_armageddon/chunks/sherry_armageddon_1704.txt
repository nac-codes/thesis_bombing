power of atomic energy. Such targets were of course few by the summer of 1945, and the bomb was far too powerful for its destruction to be limited to them. But they were ruled out for other reasons, because the bomb’s managers wanted to do much more than destroy a target, while the collapse of a meaningful distinction between target and city allowed them to do so under the guise of abiding by the rules of the war.® Just as almost all of Tokyo could be regarded as a military target, so could Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Just as workers could be “dehoused” without being killed, they and their leaders could be impressed without being incinerated. Just as it had rarely been clear whether conventional bombing aimed to achieve practical effect against the enemy’s war-making power or psychological impact on his “will” to fight, so too was the distinction blurred in rationales for the bomb’s use.  Nuclear policymakers also ignored the bomb as a reality of war by drawing upon another tradition of looking at air power: viewing it as a transcendent force offering opposed and mutually exclusive possibilities. It was a commonplace to recognize, as Truman did, that the bomb gave Americans “possession of a weapon that would not only revolutionize war but could alter the course of history and civilization.” As Stimson put it, and Marshall concurred, “This project should not be considered simply in terms of military weapons, but as a new relationship of man to the universe.” The bomb’s advent seemed to offer only two possibilities: it “might even mean the doom of civilization or it might mean the perfection of civilization. ... It might be a Frankenstein which would eat us up or it might be a project ‘by which the peace of the world would be helped in becoming secure.’65  Viewed that way, the bomb’s use seemed as compelling as it did revolting. Only “the actual use with its horrible results,” Stimson later paraphrased the advice he received from scientists like Conant, could “awaken the
