the creation of rationalizations and euphemisms to mask the terror, the distinction between “military target” and “city” had totally collapsed. The attention to Kyoto indicated that the shell of a distinction remained, but not its substance, reflecting less a confrontation with the moral issue than a wish it need not even arise. That failure shaped not only the fact but the manner of the bomb’s use. It helps to explain why no serious consideration was given to confining use to a military or industrial target that would have limited civilian casualties while still revealing the awesome power of atomic energy. Such targets were of course few by the summer of 1945, and the bomb was far too powerful for its destruction to be limited to them. But they were ruled out for other reasons, because the bomb’s managers wanted to do much more than destroy a target, while the collapse of a meaningful distinction between target and city allowed them to do so under the guise of abiding by the rules of the war.® Just as almost all of Tokyo could be regarded as a military target, so could Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Just as workers could be “dehoused” without being killed, they and their leaders could be impressed without being incinerated. Just as it had rarely been clear whether conventional bombing aimed to achieve practical effect against the enemy’s war-making power or psychological impact on his “will” to fight, so too was the distinction blurred in rationales for the bomb’s use.  Nuclear policymakers also ignored the bomb as a reality of war by drawing upon another tradition of looking at air power: viewing it as a transcendent force offering opposed and mutually exclusive possibilities. It was a commonplace to recognize, as Truman did, that the bomb gave Americans “possession of a weapon that would not only revolutionize war but could alter the course of history and civilization.” As Stimson put it, and Marshall concurred, “This project should not be considered simply in terms o
