eapon that would not only revolutionize war but could alter the course of history and civilization.” As Stimson put it, and Marshall concurred, “This project should not be considered simply in terms of military weapons, but as a new relationship of man to the universe.” The bomb’s advent seemed to offer only two possibilities: it “might even mean the doom of civilization or it might mean the perfection of civilization. ... It might be a Frankenstein which would eat us up or it might be a project ‘by which the peace of the world would be helped in becoming secure.’6*  Viewed that way, the bomb’s use seemed as compelling as it did revolting. Only “the actual use with its horrible results,” Stimson later paraphrased the advice he received from scientists like Conant, could “awaken the world to the necessity of abolishing war altogether.” If the bomb promised either deliverance or doomsday, if it loomed as either scourge or savior of mankind, then its psychological awesomeness became all-important, and questions regarding its immediate consequences for Japan’s cities seemed almost trivial in comparison. Of course the war had to be won, and no responsible official ignored the bomb’s potential in that regard, but it was not about that potential that they worried. Instead, they acted in that tradition of prophecy whereby the most farsighted about air power were the most nearsighted about its actual consequences in war. That predilection, so easily associated with the nuclear dilemma, in fact preceded and helped define it, for it allowed destruction to proceed almost unquestioned, while the moral energies of responsible men remained focused on man’s historical fate. Men as diverse as Oppenheimer and Stimson saw immediate employment as necessary if the world were to be forced into a contemplation of the new evil. Even the exercise of concern about that evil played a critical role in allaying doubt, for it proved that they were providing the care and consideration which this
