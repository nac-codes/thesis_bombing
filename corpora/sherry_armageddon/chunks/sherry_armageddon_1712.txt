ponent of the virtues of atomic intimidation.  While the choices were posed in familiar terms, discussion proceeded with little reference to the world’s recent experience in confronting new military technology. The informal system of deterrents against gas warfare was an encouraging example, the record of the submarine and the bomber disillusioning, and the consequences of interwar agreements on naval arms ambiguous. Neither encouraging, alarming, nor uncertain precedents were reviewed for instruction, even by the few policymakers who had had experience with arms control efforts. When a sense of the past entered into deliberations, other matters were at issue, such as the troubled record of Soviet-American relations. Marshall at least cautioned against disparaging Russian fidelity to wartime agreements and suggested that “it might be desirable to invite two prominent Russian scientists to witness the Trinity test.” Even that step seemed too bold for most of the Interim Committee, however.§?  At bottom, the awesomeness of the new weapon made the past seem irrelevant even as men unconsciously drew upon it. The bomb was seen as severing rather than unfolding familiar patterns in modern technology and international relations. Of course, this was just what many people earlier had thought of air power itself, but that continuity also escaped attention. Thus the bomb lacked reality as a weapon of war and as an instrument of international relations. An “apparition,” it could not be placed in the context of the familiar, for that seemed to ignore its awesome power. Yet the fa- miliar guided how men felt and thought about the new weapon.

Frightening as it was, the bomb would also liberate the warring nations and perhaps all of mankind from the horror of conventional warfare. Churchill gave this hope particularly vivid expression. An invasion of Japan  might well require the loss of a million
