of the bomb against Japan was sometimes questioned, the Franck Committee doubting that “the first available bombs, of comparatively low efficiency and small size, will be sufficient to break the will or ability of Japan to resist, especially given the fact that the major cities like Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Kobe already will largely have been reduced to ashes by the slower process of ordinary aerial bombing.” In a sense, this claim involved turning one argument for the bomb’s use—the marginal difference between it and conventional weapons—against employment of the atomic device. But most dissenters were too sensitive to their ignorance about the military situation in the Far East and to their lack of responsibility for American lives to press any case that the bomb was unnecessary. Although no dissenter, Oppenheimer aptly characterized the scientists’ ignorance: “We didn’t know beans about the military situation in Japan” except for being told that “the invasion was inevitable,” he recalled in 1954.4  Ralph Bard, however, was in the inner councils of nuclear decision making, and as navy under secretary was well acquainted with the war’s course. He had assented to the Interim Committee's original recommendation for use against a city without warning, but by June 27 he believed that Japan’s leaders “may be searching for some opportunity which they could use as a medium of surren- der.” He proposed that the triple effects of clarifying the surrender formula, alerting Japan to Russia's likely entry into the war, and issuing a “preliminary warning” to Japan about the bomb might avert the necessity of its use. Those initiatives would preserve America’s position “as a great humanitarian nation” and respond to “the fair play attitude of our people.” But Bard lacked and apparently did not seek out allies to back him up. By this time, Marshall had deferred to the consensus of the Interim Committee. Bard’s superior, Forrestal, was eager to change the surrender formula, but he
