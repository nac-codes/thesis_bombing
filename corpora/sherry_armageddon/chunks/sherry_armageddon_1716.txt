Of course, this was just what many people earlier had thought of air power itself, but that continuity also escaped attention. Thus the bomb lacked reality as a weapon of war and as an instrument of international relations.

For both, winning the war was an explicit objective eclipsed by other concerns. Dissenters did rais
