me token they were not especially opposed to the bomb’s employment, as long as invasion was avoided. And the navy, as a latecomer to the bomb project (Bard himself learned of it only in May), lacked the bureaucratic vantage point and intimate familiarity with the bomb to mount an effort against its use. Bard got a hearing from Truman, but it was apparently per- functory, and shortly thereafter he resigned his post. Like others who questioned the bomb’s use, he had been “hammering on locked doors.”?2  Thus the case against the bomb’s use mostly fell to men removed from ongoing operations against Japan and was advanced with little reference to the war itself. For most dissenters, the issue was the fate of mankind and their troubled consciences. At times, they seemed more concerned with absolving themselves of responsibility for the bloodbath, although of course absolution might compel efforts to avert the bombing.” Their overriding concern was that use, especially without warning, would forever jeopardize global agreement on the control or abolition of the new weapon. In this regard, they did their best to show that national interests were at stake: an unthinking or threatening introduction of the new weapon “will mean a flying start toward an unlimited arms race” in which the United States, though it might win technologically, still would lose. In atomic warfare, the advantage would “lie so heavily with the aggressor” that even an inferior power, appreciating the virtues of a first strike, might launch “a sudden unprovoked blow” or “place his ‘infernal machines’ in advance in all our major cities and explode them simultaneously.” The Franck Committee also argued that if American leaders were willing to run such a race, they would be better off not using the bomb, for use would erode the American advantage by hastening progress in competing nations.74  But in their preoccupation with the fate of mankind, dissenters paralleled the advocates in regarding the bomb’s deci
