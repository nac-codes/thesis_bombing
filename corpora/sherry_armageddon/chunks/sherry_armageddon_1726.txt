that use, especially without warning, would forever jeopardize global agreement on the control or abolition of the new weapon. In this regard, they did their best to show that national interests were at stake: an unthinking or threatening introduction of the new weapon “will mean a flying start toward an unlimited arms race” in which the United States, though it might win technologically, still would lose. In atomic warfare, the advantage would “lie so heavily with the aggressor” that even an inferior power, appreciating the virtues of a first strike, might launch “a sudden unprovoked blow” or “place his ‘infernal machines’ in advance in all our major cities and explode them simultaneously.” The Franck Committee also argued that if American leaders were willing to run such a race, they would be better off not using the bomb, for use would erode the American advantage by hastening progress in competing nations.”  But in their preoccupation with the fate of mankind, dissenters paralleled the advocates in regarding the bomb’s decisive quality as its capacity to reorder the affairs of man for good or ill. They recognized the bomb’s deadliness, but the fate of Japan became an issue for them only insofar as the bomb’s use might act perniciously on the realization of future dreams. In two ways, such an approach yielded vital territory to advocates of use. Downplaying the question of need for the bomb against Japan, it omitted altogether any claim that an atomic attack on a city was inherently evil regardless of long-run consequences, and it avoided portraying what that use would be like. In addition, by basing their argument on long-run consequences, they made it highly speculative. No one could envision those consequences with the certainty that they could predict destructive effects on a Japanese city. Moreover, the dissenters ran into the claim, equally speculative but equally defens- ible, that only the bomb’s use could shock the world into controlling the weapon and
