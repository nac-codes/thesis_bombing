rrived, to tell Groves and Arnold “his feeling that we should guard against too much gratification over our success, because it undoubtedly involved a large number of Japanese casualties.” Groves and Arnold, terribly comfortable with the new technology, pushed aside Marshall’s doubts, taking note of “the men who had made the Bataan death march.”22 Marshall and Leahy did not share their interest in revenge. Better than most policymakers, they recognized that the bomb was not an “apparition” making a “psychological” impression or important as only a new device imperiling humanity’s future; it was a military instrument for killing vast numbers of people. There was moral realism in that perspective and political foresight as well, Marshall speaking from experience with how brutal victories complicate the victor’s task after war. Those whose perspective on the bomb appeared to be narrowly military were as likely as any to explore restraints on its use, for their military experience led them to recognize the bomb’s physical destructiveness. But recognition and cautious exploration were as far as Marshall and Leahy went: their doubts had been too fragile, too wedded to a bygone ethic of warfare, too isolated by their narrow view of the officer’s role, and too attenuated by years of urgency to win the war and (in Marshall’s case) by personal investment in the bomb project.  Marshall aside, doubt about the bomb’s use usually arose when personal investment was weakest. Personal and bureaucratic distance from the Manhattan Project was the necessary precondi- tion, as shown by comparing the passivity among men making the bomb at Los Alamos to the concern among Chicago scientists and with Brewster in Tennessee and by the role that latecomers like Bard and Leahy played. But the distance that made doubt possible also made positive action improbable, for these men were not in a position to change the outcome, and they hesitated to try precisely because of their relative ignorance a
