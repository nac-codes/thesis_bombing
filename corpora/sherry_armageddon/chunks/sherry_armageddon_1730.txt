Bard got a hearing from Truman, but it was apparently per- functory, and shortly thereafter he resigned his post. Like others who questioned the bomb’s use, he had been “hammering on locked doors.”?2  Thus the case against the bomb’s use mostly fell to men removed from ongoing operations against Japan and was advanced with little reference to the war itself. For most dissenters, the issue was the fate of mankind and their troubled consciences. At times, they seemed more concerned with absolving themselves of respo
