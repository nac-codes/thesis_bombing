at an atomic attack on a city was inherently evil regardless of long-run consequences, and it avoided portraying what that use would be like. In addition, by basing their argument on long-run consequences, they made it highly speculative. No one could envision those consequences with the certainty that they could predict destructive effects on a Japanese city. Moreover, the dissenters ran into the claim, equally speculative but equally defens- ible, that only the bomb’s use could shock the world into controlling the weapon and war itself.  Only Brewster avoided slighting the immediate in favor of the fateful. For him, too, the paramount evil lay in a speculative future, which he vividly sketched: “The possession of this weapon by any one nation, no matter how benign its intentions, could not be tolerated by other great powers.” They would “watch our every move” and regard “everything we did... with suspicion and distrust.” Any time the United States spoke “we would be charged with threatening to use this weapon as a Club. ... We would be the most hated and feared nation on earth.” The resulting state of mind would crush any hopes for international agreement on atomic weapons, and some day “the spark would be struck that would send the whole world up in one flaming inferno of a third world war.”  But Brewster went beyond James Franck and Leo Szilard, who rejected immediate use as setting a bad example but skirted the decision about ending the war. He did not “want to propose anything to jeopardize the war with Japan,” but he recognized that victory was no longer the issue, and “horrible as it may seem, I know that it would be better to take greater casualties now in conquering Japan than to bring upon the world the tragedy of unrestrained competitive production of this material.” This statement squarely confronted the connection between the immediate and the long-run: the needs of the latter could not be met without short-term sacrifice. Brewster’s position probably
