ment was weakest. Personal and bureaucratic distance from the Manhattan Project was the necessary precondi- tion, as shown by comparing the passivity among men making the bomb at Los Alamos to the concern among Chicago scientists and with Brewster in Tennessee and by the role that latecomers like Bard and Leahy played. But the distance that made doubt possible also made positive action improbable, for these men were not in a position to change the outcome, and they hesitated to try precisely because of their relative ignorance and lack of final responsibility for decision. Even when they did, the prevailing secrecy, the outright suspicion of disloyalty attached to some dissent, or the adroit deflection of their efforts by Oppenheimer and other officials meant that questioning arguments often did not circulate far.  Eisenhower provided a striking example of how doubt arose outside of normal channels. When he heard about the atomic bomb is unclear, but apparently at the time of Potsdam he learned that  an atamin ham ume a umanan in hand Un immandintaler ahiantad ta ite uen Nanacdinea ta tha uaviaue ananiunte af his talls arith Ctmenn ha ahiantad an tha aenunda that Tanan eirae aleander Anfantad  Page 326 of 368 74%  _THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  i denetatetelneteia anette ete — ele — eee —aieieee A eee Se a en ny me ee a ey ne ne OR == = Sn nae re ee a oe  virtues of a first strike, might launch “a sudden unprovoked blow” or “place his ‘infernal machines’ in advance in all our major cities and explode them simultaneously. ” The Franck Committee also argued that if American leaders were willing to run such a race, they would be better off not using the bomb, for use would erode the American advantage by hastening progress in competing nations.74  But in their preoccupation with the fate of mankind, dissenters paralleled the advocates in regarding the bomb’s decisive quality as its capacity to reorder the affairs of man for good or ill.
