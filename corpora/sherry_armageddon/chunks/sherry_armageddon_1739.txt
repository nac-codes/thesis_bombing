s any to explore restraints on its use, for their military experience led them to recognize the bomb’s physical destructiveness. But recognition and cautious exploration were as far as Marshall and Leahy went: their doubts had been too fragile, too wedded to a bygone ethic of warfare, too isolated by their narrow view of the officer’s role, and too attenuated by years of urgency to win the war and (in Marshall’s case) by personal investment in the bomb project.  Marshall aside, doubt about the bomb’s use usually arose when personal investment was weakest. Personal and bureaucratic distance from the Manhattan Project was the necessary precondi- tion, as shown by comparing the passivity among men making the bomb at Los Alamos to the concern among Chicago scientists and with Brewster in Tennessee and by the role that latecomers like Bard and Leahy played. But the distance that made doubt possible also made positive action improbable, for these men were not in a position to change the outcome, and they hesitated to try precisely because of their relative ignorance and lack of final responsibility for decision. Even when they did, the prevailing secrecy, the outright suspicion of disloyalty attached to some dissent, or the adroit deflection of their efforts by Oppenheimer and other officials meant that questioning arguments often did not circulate far.  Eisenhower provided a striking example of how doubt arose outside of normal channels. When he heard about the atomic bomb is unclear, but apparently at the time of Potsdam he learned that an atomic bomb was a weapon in hand. He immediately objected to its use. According to the various accounts of his talk with Stimson, he objected on the grounds that Japan “was already defeated,” that the United States “should avoid shocking world opinion” by using the bomb, and that it might prevent a nuclear arms race if (as “I mistakenly had some faint hope”) other nations remained “ignorant of the fact that the problem of nuclear fiss
