He was not, to.be sure, stopped by Stimson’s apparently angry reaction to his arguments, for after Trinity he offered the same recommendation to “Truman and other advisors.” But Eisenhower regarded his views as “merely personal and immediate reactions; they were not based upon any analysis of the subject.” At the height of his fame, Eisenhower was too good an army man to claim authority in a theater of war for which he had no resnonsibilitv.82  Page 326 of 368 74%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON who had made the Bataan death march.””?
