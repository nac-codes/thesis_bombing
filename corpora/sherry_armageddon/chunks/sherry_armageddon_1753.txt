Words designed for home front consumption, suited well to placate or instill its belligerence, sent confusing messages to the enemy, even more so when the only way to communicate with Tokyo was through the public word. Of course, the United States might have made a direct approach through diplomatic channels, but the virtues of that method were only belatedly appreciated and pursued, in both Tokyo and Washington.

Messages aimed at home could mislead the Japanese, while messages for Tokyo could disturb Americans. Some messages to Japan were designed only to play at home. The renewed demand for unconditional surrender drafted in the midst of the Okinawa battle was intended to head off any Japanese peace feelers tempting to war-weary Americans. McCloy, the assistant war secretary, recognized the problem in speaking to two audiences: Americans “would properly and promptly resent it if the services seemed to be arguing, without sound reasons, against the possibility of surrender discussions.” And while threatening “the extinction of the Japanese people” might please some Americans, “we must not deny the Japanese people all hope,” if their suicidal resistance was to be averted.
