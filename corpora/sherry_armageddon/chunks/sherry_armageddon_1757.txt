ce chief in May, “the Japanese will be more inclined to fanatical resistance to the end.” The challenge was to calibrate the infliction of further pain against the need to leave something for the enemy to desire to preserve.®>  Better recognition in 1945 of how signals could be confused would have raised useful questions about how to proceed with the bombing, how to align it with messages to Japan, and how to interpret Japanese peace feelers. Instead, as Stimson later put it, those feelers “merely stimulated the American leaders in their desire to press home on all Japanese leaders the hopelessness of their cause; this was the nature of warmaking. In war, as in a boxing match, it is seldom sound for the stronger combatant to moderate his blows whenever his opponent showed signs of weakening.” As Paul Kecskemeti has pointed out, Stimson’s reasoning rested on a false analogy: where “the stronger boxer has good reason” to fear his opponent’s “lucky blow,” at “the terminal stage of war ...the loser cannot change the strategic outcome,” and the victor’s task is simply to forestall “superfluous losses.” Without a coherent and consistent notion of how to align words and deeds, there was no alterna- tive to ending the war except by the most rapid application of all forms of power against the enemy.8¢  There was a lot of “noise,” to use Roberta Wohlstetter’s term, in the signals sent out by Washington and flowing into it through its hair-trigger intelligence apparatus. Yet the story of surrender and the atomic bomb was not a kind of Pearl Harbor stood on its head, the Americans now with the upper hand but the perils of bureaucratic confusion the same. Distortions emerged from the swirling signals less because of their sheer volume than because of the predilections of bureaucrats to screen out some signals and emphasize others, on their own initiative or on cue from higher authorities. The confusion about signals reflected disorder in Washington (and in Tokyo as well) about w
