had done little to prepare Americans to make them. The divergence between the public and private utterances of Leahy was not unique. Grew, the most forceful advocate of an open mind on the emperor's fate, earlier had conjured up visions of a Japan whose fanaticism was almost limitless, whose intent was to invade the United States, whose ambitions were so “overweening” that “even the megalomania of Hitler is surpassed.” Privately taking a more textured view, Grew began to offer it publicly in 1944 and 1945. But as late as July 1945, Grew publicly insisted on “unconditional surrender” and dismissed Japanese peace feelers in light of “Pearl Harbor, Wake, Manila.” Perhaps he considered public stridency as neces- sary to protect patriotic credentials and private influence. At no time in his memoirs did he recognize how his public statements encouraged the mood he sought to counter in 1945.82  Grew, Stimson, Marshall, and others failed in their efforts to include in the Potsdam declaration a clear assurance to Japan that it could retain the emperor. Even before the Potsdam Conference, Byrnes’s State Department watered down the language Stimson and Grew had drafted, validation for Stimson’s fear of “the feeling of war passion and hysteria which seizes hold of a nation like ours in the prosecution of such a bitter war.” Byrnes also consulted the retired Cordell Hull, who found the assurances “too much like appeasement of Japan.” Hull’s fears were vague, but like other leaders earl- ier, he worried that “appeasement” would cause “terrible political repercussions” in the United States and undermine the will of Americans to sustain the costs of invasion.22  Hull only told Byrnes, with his keen eye for public opinion, what he wanted to hear. After learning of Hull’s position, Grew, Stimson, and Marshall ceased to press their case zealously. Hull, after all, was willing to offer the assurances later, during “the climax of allied bombing and Russia’s entry into the war.” Though
