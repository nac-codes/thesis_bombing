, Stimson, and Marshall ceased to press their case zealously. Hull, after all, was willing to offer the assurances later, during “the climax of allied bombing and Russia’s entry into the war.” Though Stimson might have liked those assurances to come earlier, his only binding deadline was the moment of invasion, and Hull’s timing accorded with the need to coordinate all forms of leverage against Japan. Besides, when it came to public opinion, Byrnes had Truman's attention. As finally issued—by broadcast rather than through private channels—the Potsdam declaration of July 26 did include a vague promise, salvaged by Marshall, of American withdrawal from Japan when “there has been established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people a peacefully inclined and responsible government.” Experts in diplomatic code might find buried in that phrasing the assurances Tokyo needed, but in their more explicit form they had been excised.24  Since precisely this issue of the emperor’s fate held up surrender even after Hiroshima and Russia’s entry into the war, until Byrnes and Truman offered firmer assurances, their decision at Potsdam has been widely and rightly condemned as the most tragic blunder in American surrender policy, even by insiders who otherwise supported the bomb’s use. There can be no certainty that Japan would have accepted in July what it submitted to in August, but the chance was there, and as Ralph Bard had argued earlier, the risks of pursuing it small. Moreover, the moral risks in the oppos- ite direction, in pursuing an atomic solution before attempting to break the diplomatic impasse, were large. Michael Walzer has explained them persuasively:  if killing millions (or many thousands) of men and women was militarily necessary for their conquest and overthrow, then it was morally necessary—in order not to kill those people—to settle for something  Page 332 of 368 76%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  These d
