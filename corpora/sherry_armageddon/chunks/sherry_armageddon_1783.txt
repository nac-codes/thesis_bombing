ortant thing.” Six months later, Truman recalled that at Potsdam “we were anxious for Russian entry,” just as his memoirs stated that as of July 24 “Churchill was as anxious as I was for the Russians to come into the Japanese war.” In turn, Churchill, despite his expressed confidence in a quick, atomic victory, still doubted that Japan would surrender if the terms remained unconditional. In any event, Churchill, de- feated in elections at home, had to leave Potsdam, and his successor, Clement Attlee, apparently harbored no hope that the bomb would end the war before Russian entry.10°  Truman’s uncertainty came out in other ways. On the twenty-third, Stimson noted, the president was still “very anxious to know whether Marshall felt that we needed the Russians in the war or whether we could get along without them.” Via Stimson’s oversimplification of Marshall’s views, Truman got the assurance he wanted, but his query alone suggested that his newfound confidence was shaky. Certainly any desire to delay Russian entry was compromised when Truman informed Stalin, if only with euphemisms, of America’s possession of its new weapon; if Stalin understood Tru- man’s message, it would only have prompted him to order his armies to march sooner.101  Most likely, Truman wanted to believe that Trinity eliminated his problems and made all objectives obtainable, and some advisors, most often Byrnes, backed him up in that hope. But Truman was still too untutored in war, too dependent on the counsel of military advisors, too erratic in his own outlook to sustain his hope about the bomb. In turn, Marshall, Arnold, Leahy, and other military advisors—for different reasons but with the same results—still could not promise that the thing would even work in battle, much less that it would end the war before the Russians came in, especially since only two bombs would be ready for immediate use. Indeed, when it occurred, “the abrupt surrender of Japan came more or less as a surprise” to Arnold
