Another navy man, Admiral Leahy, “indulged in a hope that Japan might get out of the war before the Soviet Government came in.” None of these men had Marshall’s stature or access to Truman, but they had influence. More important were the views of Stimson: “The news from Alamogordo . . . made it clear to the Americans that further diplomatic efforts to bring the Russians into the Pacific war were largely pointless. The bomb as a merely probable weapon had seemed a weak reed on which to rely, but the bomb as a colossal reality was very different.” Stimson, caught between the perils and temptations of nuclear diplomacy, did not follow the consistent line this passage from his memoirs might suggest.
