The possibility of using the bomb to crowd Stalin out of the war sent Churchill into bellicose ecstasy, although his military chiefs were more cautious. The exhausted and erratic prime minister did not always impress or get his way with Truman. He certainly made his views known.28  Nonetheless, at the time and afterward, Truman revealed better than anyone else how difficult it was to fix the possibility that loomed so temptingly. On July 17, after the first sparse message on Trinity had already arrived, Truman recorded good news from Stalin. “He’ll be in the Jap War on August 15.

A more surefooted leader might have seized the moment and mobilized his government behind a strategy to preempt Soviet entry. Truman was unsure what to believe.
