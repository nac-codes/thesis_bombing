alling the latter. If then the bomb failed quickly to win the war and if word later leaked out that the war had been prolonged because Americans delayed Russian entry—all this allowing the Russians off the hook and American boys to die in their place—American leaders could have been deeply embarrassed. Sen. Alexander Wiley had made quite clear on July 25 the feeling at home that “countless American lives are at stake in Russia's decisions.” Out in the Pacific, MacArthur, belatedly informed of the bomb, told reporters Russian entry was “welcome” for just the same reason: “Every Russian killed was one less American who had to be.”295  To enter the most speculative realm, it seems likely that even had Russian entry been greeted with open arms, rather than accepted as a painful aid and inevitability, the bomb would have been used on the same timetable. Given the momentum to use the bomb and end the war quickly, the appropriate rationale for the quickest employment could have been assembled: would not the Russian allies themselves be pleased by any action reducing their losses? In the event, Stalin, on hearing from Truman of America’s “new weapon of unusual destructive force,” did express the hope “we would make ‘good use of it against the Japanese.” The point again is that a different course was not so much rejected as never seriously pondered; its implementation would have required a painful reversal of momentum already deeply established, by an administration whose untidy methods (it took months simply to hammer out the wording of the Potsdam declaration) make it foolish to think it could have abruptly reversed years of interest in bringing Moscow into the Pacific war.1°%  The temptation to regard the bomb as eliminating hard choices among priorities could not become an operating policy in a few weeks. Resistance to making hard choices preceded the bomb’s arrival, which at most simply made more tolerable the prevailing confusion. Confusion arose out of uncertainty abo
