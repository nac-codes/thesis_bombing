perating policy in a few weeks. Resistance to making hard choices preceded the bomb’s arrival, which at most simply made more tolerable the prevailing confusion. Confusion arose out of uncertainty about America’s purposes in the war, out of the disorderly processes of policy, and out of Truman's understandable difficulty in mastering the machinery designed to help him set a course. It also grew out of a long-standing view of air power as a weapon capable of fulfilling so many purposes that hard choices and precise rationales for its use did not seem necessary. In turn, the confusion about methods and goals in achieving Japan’s surrender helped men to make decisions without full consciousness of their consequences. Therein lay the tragedy of American policy over the summer of 1945, more than in the specific failure to risk assurances to Japan necessary to secure surrender. American leaders bore a heavy responsibility, and none treated it cavalierly. But war’s momentum and confusion, combined with air power’s inviting ease and multiple attractions, allowed responsibility to be exercised in decisions whose consequences, for the war and for mankind, were not firmly addressed.  After the war, Truman took full responsibility for ordering atomic bombs to be dropped on Japanese cities. His claim has diminished upon inspection, even of some of the statements Truman himself later made. “The final decision of where and when to use the atomic bomb was up to me. Let there be no mistake about it,” Truman later wrote in his memoirs: he decided “where” and “when,” not whether to bomb. There was no soul-searching moment when his hand trembled above an order he had to sign. The order to Spaatz for the Twentieth Air Force to “deliver its first special bomb” was dated July 24, citing the explicit “approval of the Secretary of War and the Chief of Staff,” and was confirmed on July 25 by Marshall and Stimson in communication between Potsdam and War Department headquarters in Washington.
