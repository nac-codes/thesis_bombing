most speculative realm, it seems likely that even had Russian entry been greeted with open arms, rather than accepted as a painful aid and inevitability, the bomb would have been used on the same timetable. Given the momentum to use the bomb and end the war quickly, the appropriate rationale for the quickest employment could have been assembled: would not the Russian allies themselves be pleased by any action reducing their losses? In the event, Stalin, on hearing from Truman of America’s “new weapon of unusual destructive force,” did express the hope “we would make ‘good use of it against the Japanese.” The point again is that a different course was not so much rejected as never seriously pondered; its implementation would have required a painful reversal of momentum already deeply established, by an administration whose untidy methods (it took months simply to hammer out the wording of the Potsdam declaration) make it foolish to think it could have abruptly reversed years of interest in bringing Moscow into the Pacific war.10  The temptation to regard the bomb as eliminating hard choices among priorities could not become an operating policy in a few weeks. Resistance to making hard choices preceded the bomb’s arrival, which at most simply made more tolerable the prevailing confusion. Confusion arose out of uncertainty about America’s purposes in the war, out of the disorderly processes of policy, and out of Truman’s understandable difficulty in mastering the machinery designed to help him set a course. It also grew out of a long-standing view of air power as a weapon capable of fulfilling so many purposes that hard choices and precise rationales for its use did not seem necessary. In turn, the confusion about methods and goals in achieving Japan’s surrender helped men to make decisions without full consciousness of their consequences. Therein lay the tragedy of American policy over the summer of 1945, more than in the specific failure to risk assurances to Japan
