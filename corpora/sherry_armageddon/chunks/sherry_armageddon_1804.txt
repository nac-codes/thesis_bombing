it was ready—irrespective of other threats to Japan that might be applied. Moreover, just as no one could predict that the bomb would end the war quickly, no one could be certain that Russian entry would do so. Even Marshall had hedged his bets: it would be “decisive . . . at that time or shortly thereafter if we land in Japan.” In that climate of uncertainty, it seemed to make little sense to delay on either option, atomic bombing or Russian intervention. And there were palpable risks in forestalling the latter. If then the bomb failed quickly to win the war and if word later leaked out that the war had been prolonged because Americans delayed Russian entry—all this allowing the Russians off the hook and American boys to die in their place—American leaders could have been deeply embarrassed. Sen. Alexander Wiley had made quite clear on July 25 the feeling at home that “countless American lives are at stake in Russia’s decisions.” Out in the Pacific, MacArthur, belatedly informed of the bomb, told reporters Russian entry was “welcome” for just the same reason: “Every Russian killed was one less American who had to be.”105  To enter the most speculative realm, it seems likely that even had Russian entry been greeted with open arms, rather than accepted as a painful aid and inevitability, the bomb would have been used on the same timetable. Given the momentum to use the bomb and end the war quickly, the appropriate rationale for the quickest employment could have been assembled: would not the Russian allies themselves be pleased by any action reducing their losses? In the event, Stalin, on hearing from Truman of America’s “new weapon of unusual destructive force,” did express the hope “we would make ‘good use of it against the Japanese.” The point again is that a different course was not so much rejected as never seriously pondered; its implementation would have required a painful reversal of momentum already deeply established, by an administration whose untidy meth
