But none of these signs pointed clearly to the value or necessity of Tokyo's immediate acceptance. Without a Russian signature, time to maneuver still seemed to remain. If the Allies did not declare they would abolish the throne, they did not say they would preserve it. And if they regarded Hirohito as one of those “war criminals” to whom they promised “stern justice,” would there be an emperor left whom the “freely expressed will” could enthrone?  In face of conflicting pressures and signals, the government’s response to Potsdam was one of caution and delay. Suzuki’s famous response to the Potsdam declaration contained the word “mokusatsu,” a term subject to various translations (“to kill with silence” or “to ignore”) none of which was likely to deflect the Americans from their path.1°  So preparations to deliver the bomb went forward. For the scientists and officers responsible for its development, the decisive moment had already come in New Mexico on July 16 when the plutonium bomb was tested (no test of the uranium bomb was deemed necessary before its use). They knew then they had captured the power of the gods, knew it when they heard the “awesome roar which warned of doomsday and made us feel that we puny things were blasphemous to dare tamper with the forces heretofore reserved to The Almighty.” They knew it when they saw a fireball that “closely resembled a rising sun,” when they created “a searing light with the intensity many times that of the midday sun,” when they transformed the desert “from darkness to brilliant sunshine in an instant.” Even the unsentimental Groves felt a “profound awe.” Almost rhapsodic recollections of the moment spoke of an ultimate experience: the fireball “lighted every peak, crevasse and ridge of the nearby mountain range with a clarity and beauty that cannot be described but must be seen to be imagined. It was that beauty
