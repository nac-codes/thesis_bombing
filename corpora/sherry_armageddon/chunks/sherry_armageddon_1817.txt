Rain fell after the atomic firestorms, as it often had after incendiary raids, but it was a black rain carrying a deadly residue of fallout. The aiming point of the Hiroshima bomb—the Aioi bridge— perversely survived the attack, as other nominal targets had survived other bombing raids, but this time inaccuracy made little difference.11¢ Like countless others, two cities had been destroyed, but in seconds rather than hours or days.
