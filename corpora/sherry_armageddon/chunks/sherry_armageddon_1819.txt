relations. They honed the statements to be released when the bomb had been used and cleared away last-minute objections to disclosure of certain scientific information on the bomb. The various proposals and petitions about the bomb’s use from the scientific community inched their way through the bureaucracy, reaching the White House too late to influence Truman. Then the managers and their president waited.  On the morning of August 6 (still August 5 in Washington), the untested uranium bomb exploded over Hiroshima, and on August 9, after the aircrew diverted from its primary target, the plutonium bomb struck Nagasaki. At last the overstrained bomber crews could experience the relief that scientists and other officers had enjoyed on July 16. What they had seen was a macabre vari- ation on six macabre years of aerial warfare, as if a film of all that had happened had been rewound and suddenly replayed in an instant. The results both confirmed and mocked the facile comparisons made then and later between incendiary and atomic bombing. Blast and fire killed tens of thousands, as they had at Hamburg and Tokyo, but there were also the special victims of radiation poisoning. Rain fell after the atomic firestorms, as it often had after incendiary raids, but it was a black rain carrying a deadly residue of fallout. The aiming point of the Hiroshima bomb—the Aioi bridge— perversely survived the attack, as other nominal targets had survived other bombing raids, but this time inaccuracy made little difference.1!6 Like countless others, two cities had been destroyed, but in seconds rather than hours or days. On August 6 and August 9, and in the stream of deaths that has continued since, a minimum of one hundred thousand and more likely over two hundred thou- sand Japanese died.117  The psychic scars that survivors carried were in many ways similar to those which Germans in Dresden or countrymen in Tokyo had suffered. Many reacted like the Nagasaki victim who felt “no bitternes
