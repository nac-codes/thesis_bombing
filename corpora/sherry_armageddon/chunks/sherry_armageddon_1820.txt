The psychic scars that survivors carried were in many ways similar to those which Germans in Dresden or countrymen in Tokyo had suffered. Many reacted like the Nagasaki victim who felt “no bitterness against the Americans. He would rather blame the Japanese government for prolonging the war.”118 A minority did feel bitter, of course, just as in Tokyo, and as always there were subtle variations among individuals and groups and over time. As earlier, there were also many for whom accusation seemed pointless. What decisively distinguished the atomic bomb survivors was their reactions in the months and years to follow. Knowledge of the long-term lethality of radiation, of their special place in the inauguration of nuclear technology, and of the special attention given them fed a lasting sense of experiencing a life-ending trauma with global implications. Before 1945 it had been possible to see in air war the potential for global destruction, but survivors of Hamburg or Tokyo rarely connected the extinction of their cities with the fate of the species. For atomic bomb victims, that connection became indissoluble.1!2  That implication, however, like many others of the atomic attacks,, was not immediately apparent, either in Japan or in the United States, where people struggled to grasp or to ignore what distinguished these two cataclysms from the war’s other horrors. Even among men knowledgeable about the bomb in advance of its use, news of Hiroshima produced no quick conviction that they might now halt the making of war. On the eighth, Marshall angrily cabled Spaatz about the “incalculable harm” he and LeMay had done to the army by making public statements “that our present Army is not necessary for the further prosecution of the war in the Pacific,” that “invasion will be unnecessary, and that the future of Armies has been decidedly curtailed.” Stimson also caught the mood of uncertainty persisting even after Stalin’s armies rolled. “The bomb and the entrance of the R
