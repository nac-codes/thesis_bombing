unnecessary, and that the future of Armies has been decidedly curtailed.” Stimson also caught the mood of uncertainty persisting even after Stalin’s armies rolled. “The bomb and the entrance of the Russians into the war”—notably enough, he put the two on equal footing—“will certainly have an effect on hastening the victory. But just how much effect is on how long and how many men we will have to keep to accomplish that victory, it is impossible to determine.” From his vantage point in the Pacific, MacArthur still insisted on going forward with the planned invasion of Japan. “In my opinion, there should not be the slightest thought of changing the OLYMPic operation.” In a long-run perspective, perhaps these three pillars of the army were not so shortsighted as they might appear; the bomb did not sound the death knell of the foot soldier so readily as many Americans rushed to believe. It is only fair to add that army generals, far from feeling cheated out of the glory of invasion, could feel great relief that it did not have to take place. But the acerbic comment Haywood Hansell later made was also appropriate: “The atomic bomb was needed not only to convince the Japanese that further resistance was futile,” but to “save the Army from its obsession with invasion.”12°  Yet the air force was scarcely more capable of reversing course in light of the new developments. Both Spaatz and General Farrell wanted a third atomic bomb to be dropped on Tokyo, although on August 10, when news came of the Japanese response to the Potsdam declaration, Spaatz was uneasy about further area bombing; halting it, he sparked erroneous reports of an American cease-fire. But final settlement of the surrender terms was delayed until the fourteenth, and in the meantime, as the official history puts it, “Arnold wanted as big a finale as possible.” He got it on the fourteenth, when 1,014 aircraft, including 828 B-29s, sortied against Japan. Combat flights then ceased, although Spaatz ordered a “
