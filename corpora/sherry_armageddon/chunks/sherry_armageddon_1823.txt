of Hamburg or Tokyo rarely connected the extinction of their cities with the fate of the species. For atomic bomb victims, that connection became indissoluble.142  That implication, however, like many others of the atomic attacks,, was not immediately apparent, either in Japan or in the United States, where people struggled to grasp or to ignore what distinguished these two cataclysms from the war’s other horrors. Even among men knowledgeable about the bomb in advance of its use, news of Hiroshima produced no quick conviction that they might now halt the making of war. On the eighth, Marshall angrily cabled Spaatz about the “incalculable harm” he and LeMay had done to the army by making public statements “that our present Army is not necessary for the further prosecution of the war in the Pacific,” that “invasion will be unnecessary, and that the future of Armies has been decidedly curtailed.” Stimson also caught the mood of uncertainty persisting even after Stalin’s armies rolled. “The bomb and the entrance of the Russians into the war”—notably enough, he put the two on equal footing—“will certainly have an effect on hastening the victory. But just how much effect is on how long and how many men we will have to keep to accomplish that victory, it is impossible to determine.” From his vantage point in the Pacific, MacArthur still insisted on going forward with the planned invasion of Japan. “In my opinion, there should not be the slightest thought of changing the OLYMPIc operation.” In a long-run perspective, perhaps these three pillars of the army were not so shortsighted as they might appear; the bomb did not sound the death knell of the foot soldier so readily as many Americans rushed to believe. It is only fair to add that army generals, far from feeling cheated out of the glory of invasion, could feel great relief that it did not have to take place. But the acerbic comment Haywood Hansell later made was also appropriate: “The atomic bomb was needed not only to
