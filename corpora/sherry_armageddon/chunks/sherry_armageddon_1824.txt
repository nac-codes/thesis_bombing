Combat flights then ceased, although Spaatz ordered a “display of air power” to continue until the surrender was signed, ostensibly to remind the Japanese die-hards that they had lost the war.121  Most of these operations after the tenth were public relations, not strategy. The public relations officers instantly recognized that the atomic bomb story was the biggest of the war, “giving Army Air Forces vast prestige,” but they also feared that in the public relations “rat race,” the navy was “having the edge.” They maneuvered and pleaded to make sure “our Air correspondents go in on the first phase of this occupation, comic opera that it is”; to “get our gang onto the Missouri to witness the signing of the surrender”; and to seize some “Japanese bigshots who might give us the right kind of quotations for publication about what bombing did to win the war.” The “whole damn thing from now on is politics and publicity,” and it was time the generals realized that “effective public relations is never an immaculate
