all day after the punishment is over; if you want to keep his affection, punishment takes care of itself.” The Japanese “are a smiling people and we have to get on those terms with them.” The comment was flavored with Stimson’s genteel, unselfconscious racism, and ostensibly it related to Japan’s treatment after surrender. But it was also a far cry from the boxing metaphor he used to describe his justification in July for the bomb’s use, implying a recognition of the helplessness of a nation whose punishment Stimson had so recently accepted. Now he wanted further bombing halted.13°  Stimson was also moving toward his eloquent plea to Truman and the cabinet in September for an agreement with the Soviet Union about sharing and controlling the secrets of atomic energy. The agreement should be made, he contended, even if it meant speedier Soviet acquisition of the bomb technology, which Stimson regarded as inevitable within five years in any event. Only concessions and mutual trust could produce the agreement, and it had to be a bargain “that has some chance of being kept and saving civilization not for five or for twenty years, but forever.” It was Stimson’s finest hour, though his eloquence went unheeded. As with most of the protesting scientists before Hiroshima and with Eisenhower in July, the distance from power that provided Stimson perspective also limited his persuasiveness and influence.134  Truman’s own reactions to the bomb’s use are less clear. He lacked Stimson’s capacity for productive doubt, and his brittle defensiveness yielded a stream of contradictory reactions. His initial comment, made to the men of the Augusta, was an ill-chosen remark: “This is the greatest thing in history.” Once in Washington, he may have momentarily flinched at what he had done. As Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace recorded the August 10 cabinet meeting: “Truman said he had given orders to stop atomic bombing [no third bomb would be ready for several days anyway].
