n his own defense of his actions. “The world will note,” he stressed on August 9, “that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base,” as if city and base were one and the same. True, in addressing his subordinates amid the Berlin crisis in 1948, Truman seemed to imply something else, emphasizing that the atomic bomb “is so terribly destructive. ... It is used to wipe out women and children and unarmed people, and not for military uses.” But Truman made no explicit reference to Hiroshima on that occasion, and out of office he reasserted that he “had ordered the A Bomb dropped on Japan at two places devoted almost exclusively to war production.” Almost nine years later, the phrasing he and Stimson had worked out at Potsdam remained intact.134  Like American officials, the America media tried with indifferent success to measure the novelty of the atomic cataclysms. A continuity between reactions to the nuclear bomb and responses to conventional bombing provided steady undercurrent to the surface waves of astonishment, delight, and horror about the bomb’s revolutionary nature. Even a casual reading of stories on the bomb would have driven home the quantum leap in destructiveness it represented. Yet the terms understandably used to express that leap—the atomic bombs were commonly equated in destructive force to twenty thousand tons of TNT, or the bomb load carried by some two thousand B-29s in a conventional raid—indicated also that the novel could be understood only in terms of the ordinary. Furthermore, the AAF tended to deemphasize the difference between its conventional and atomic weapons. Knowing that the last ready bomb had been delivered against Nagasaki, Spaatz emphasized that the nuclear bomb “as of now is only a comparatively insignificant weapon in [my] arsenal.” The Enola Gay’s commander, Paul Tibbets, was quoted about what he witnessed, often to vivid effect, but he also pointed out that his bomber “was not shaken as much by the [atomic]
