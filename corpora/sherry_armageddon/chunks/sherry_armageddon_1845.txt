ls suppressed information, resorted to euphemisms, or selectively released the truth about the atomic attacks, as they had done earlier with firebombing. Even visual testimony, Japanese film confiscated by the American government and the lengthy color footage shot by army filmmakers early in the occupation, remained hidden for decades, the result of a combination of military secrecy and bureaucratic ineptitude. Censorship expressed rather than defied common assumptions about what was decent or useful for portrayal. An old pattern of looking away from bombing continued, perhaps compounded by the need to deny what the United States itself might experience. As often happened during the airplane’s infancy, the immediate was slighted in favor of the transcendent. The reality of Hiroshima and Nagasaki seemed less important than the bomb’s effect on “mankind’s destiny,” on “humanity’s choice,” on “what is happening to men’s minds,” and on hopes (now often extravagantly revived) to achieve world government. The bomb’s “measurable destruction” seemed less telling to the novelist Mary McCarthy than its explosive impact on “the moral world.”137  Like American governmental leaders, the American media emphasized the pro-found novelty of nuclear technology. The bomb story “read like some incredible fiction,” commented the New York Times, although it was, as the New Yorker wryly pointed out, something that science fiction writers had merrily published during the war years.138 It seemed that the bomb’s advent, far from being a logical culmination of an air war long practiced, had severed the continuity of history itself. This was what the War Department called the “Cosmic Bomb,” and it marked the dawn of a “New Age,” not the high noon or sunset of an older one.132  Even the few critics of bombing had trouble placing atomic weapons in historical context. The Christian Century mounted a harsh attack on the bomb’s use, but its mention of the war’s earlier bombing was perfunctory, allo
