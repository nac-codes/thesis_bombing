The Christian Century mounted a harsh attack on the bomb’s use, but its mention of the war’s earlier bombing was perfunctory, allowing the magazine to speak of “the impetuous adoption of this incredibly inhuman instrument,” when in fact the bomb’s use, seen in war’s context, was hardly impetu- ous at all.
