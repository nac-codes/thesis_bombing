about the bomb’s revolutionary nature. Even a casual reading of stories on the bomb would have driven home the quantum leap in destructiveness it represented. Yet the terms understandably used to express that leap—the atomic bombs were commonly equated in destructive force to twenty thousand tons of TNT, or the bomb load carried by some two thousand B-29s in a conventional raid—indicated also that the novel could be understood only in terms of the ordinary. Furthermore, the AAF tended to deemphasize the difference between its conventional and atomic weapons. Knowing that the last ready bomb had been delivered against Nagasaki, Spaatz emphasized that the nuclear bomb “as of now is only a comparatively insignificant weapon in [my] arsenal.” The Enola Gay’s commander, Paul Tibbets, was quoted about what he witnessed, often to vivid effect, but he also pointed out that his bomber “was not shaken as much by the [atomic] blast as it would have been by thermal updrafts fron an incendiary attack on a Japanese city at low level.” Headlines provided another gauge to the media’s difficulty in separating the new from the familiar. In the New York Times’s August 7 edition, the new bomb had sole billing, but the next day it had to share space with other war news headlined “CARRIER PLANES STRIKE NEAR CHINA COAST” and with reports of an especially devastating fire raid on Yawata.135  As throughout the air war, the media also had trouble translating bombing into vivid words and images. The atomic clouds over Hiroshima and Nagasaki made an awesome sight in photographs but obscured what happened on the ground. High-altitude before-and-after photographs were impressive documents to the acreage destroyed, but abstract and similar to earlier images of firebombed cities. The best clue to what happened in Japan came from eyewitness accounts quickly published about the Trinity test—vivid descriptions, but not about a city. Meanwhile, Japanese news-papers and broadcasts reported the destruc
