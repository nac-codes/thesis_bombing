acknowledging the em- peror’s place without offending Americans at home and by writing the Russians out of a role in occupation.142  Diplomacy still ended the war. In its first use, the unconditional power of the atomic bomb did not compel unconditional surrender. By itself, it neither won nor ended the war, though certainly it hastened that end. Yet it quickly became possible for most Americans to think and speak as if the bomb had “won” the war, and as the cold war heated up, their leaders were disinclined to acknow- ledge a significant Soviet role in hastening Japan’s surrender or a significant limitation on a weapon becoming the mainstay of the American arsenal.  It was probably the conviction that the bomb was winning the war that made Americans, in an August 8 poll, so approving of the bomb’s use. The polls soon indicated subtle variations on that approval: many Americans wished the bomb had not been used first on a city or used the second time so quickly; on the other hand, in a Fortune poll taken in December 1945, almost 23 percent wished that the United States had “quickly used many more of them before Japan had a chance to surrender,” still another measure of the persistent appeal of bombing as act of vengeance. Poll data do not allow precision in measuring how Americans judged the relative role of Russia and the atomic bomb in securing Japan’s surrender. But probably most were convinced of the bomb’s decisiveness. Because of that dubious assumption, atomic bombing seemed to have met the minimum criteria for legitimacy as an act of war—it was useful—and therefore moral inquiry tended to be limited. Among those who pressed that inquiry a bit further, acommon view was that the atomic attacks had saved thousands of Japanese (and of course American) lives; or as the Chicago Tribune editorialized about American leaders, “Being merciless, they were merciful.”15°  In any event, there was perhaps another reason, besides relief at the war’s end, to embrace the bom
