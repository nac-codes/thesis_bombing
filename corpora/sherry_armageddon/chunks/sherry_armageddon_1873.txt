ny attempt to realize it again imperiled those who held it as well as those others whom the bomb was to instruct. Some hoped that air power in its new form would realize its old promise by deterring war altogether. There was no easy or safe way to validate that notion. In an earlier age, it had been possible to test fantasy, even if little enlightenment had been drawn from London in 1917, Barcelona in 1938, and Berlin in 1943. In the new age, it seemed likely there would be no rehearsal for Armageddon.  Epilogue  Today, few Americans know much about what happened at Hamburg, Dresden, Tokyo, and scores of other cities during World War II. The atomic bomb’s use against Japan—or rather, how people have chosen to remember and regard it—has largely obliterated awareness of the bomber’s earlier toll. In a longer view, however, continuity in the history of aerial warfare seems as striking as change. For all that 1945 demarcates the start of a second age in that history, indeed in human history, the burden of the atomic age has been similar to the one shouldered by an earlier generation.  Continuity has been most apparent in how people have thought and argued about bombing. The disputes they pursued for four decades after 1945, though more arcane because the technology became more rarified, were depressingly similar to earlier debates. Much as they did a half-century ago, for example, the American armed services still quarreled vigorously over which should control aerial technology and which can best survive its advances. Disagreement about the accuracy and potency of air power, though burdened with obscure terms like fratricide in recent times, echoed in substance the debates that swirled around Billy Mitchell in the 1920s. Argument about the vulnerability of military forces to an enemy’s first strike, renewed with particular force several years ago dur- ing the MX missile controversy, played upon much the same nightmare that vexed strategists and statesmen, especially in
