o an enemy’s first strike, renewed with particular force several years ago dur- ing the MX missile controversy, played upon much the same nightmare that vexed strategists and statesmen, especially in England, during the 1920s and 1930s.  Just as the issues are often similar, the assumptions behind them have changed little. In both eras, most people assumed that the offensive use of air power would triumph over the defensive. Those who dissented from that proposition—most recently, the proponents of President Ronald Reagan’s so-called Star Wars program—still shared another widespread assumption, that the problems created by modern military technology could be solved by further advances in it.1 Still another persistent assumption underlay the tendency of nuclear powers to construct modern versions of the  chan-urindaur air fareac canctricted hy Puranean rivale an tha ave af World War 11_fnreac that ic dacionad ta intimidate ar ta damanctrata racalva hit aftan hacked hy an annaratie af eammand  Page 353 of 368 80%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON  Diplomacy still ended the war. In its first use, the unconditional power of the atomic bomb did not compel unconditional surrender. By itself, it neither won nor ended the war, though certainly it hastened that end. Yet it quickly became possible for most Americans to think and speak as if the bomb had “won” the war, and as the cold war heated up, their leaders were disinclined to acknow- ledge a significant Soviet role in hastening Japan’s surrender or a significant limitation on a weapon becoming the mainstay of the American arsenal.  It was probably the conviction that the bomb was winning the war that made Americans, in an August 8 poll, so approving of the bomb’s use. The polls soon indicated subtle variations on that approval: many Americans wished the bomb had not been used first on a city or used the second time so quickly; on the other hand, in a Fortune poll taken in December 1945, almost
