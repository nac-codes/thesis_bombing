the history of aerial warfare seems as striking as change. For all that 1945 demarcates the start of a second age in that history, indeed in human history, the burden of the atomic age has been similar to the one shouldered by an earlier generation.  Continuity has been most apparent in how people have thought and argued about bombing. The disputes they pursued for four decades after 1945, though more arcane because the technology became more rarified, were depressingly similar to earlier debates. Much as they did a half-century ago, for example, the American armed services still quarreled vigorously over which should control aerial technology and which can best survive its advances. Disagreement about the accuracy and potency of air power, though burdened with obscure terms like fratricide in recent times, echoed in substance the debates that swirled around Billy Mitchell in the 1920s. Argument about the vulnerability of military forces to an enemy’s first strike, renewed with particular force several years ago dur- ing the MX missile controversy, played upon much the same nightmare that vexed strategists and statesmen, especially in England, during the 1920s and 1930s.  Just as the issues are often similar, the assumptions behind them have changed little. In both eras, most people assumed that the offensive use of air power would triumph over the defensive. Those who dissented from that proposition—most recently, the proponents of President Ronald Reagan’s so-called Star Wars program—still shared another widespread assumption, that the problems created by modern military technology could be solved by further advances in it. Still another persistent assumption underlay the tendency of nuclear powers to construct modern versions of the shop-window air forces constructed by European rivals on the eve of World War II—forces, that is, designed to intimidate or to demonstrate resolve but often backed by an apparatus of command, logistics, training, and reserves of dubi
