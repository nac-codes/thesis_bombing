, echoed in substance the debates that swirled around Billy Mitchell in the 1920s. Argument about the vulnerability of military forces to an enemy’s first strike, renewed with particular force several years ago dur- ing the MX missile controversy, played upon much the same nightmare that vexed strategists and statesmen, especially in England, during the 1920s and 1930s.  Just as the issues are often similar, the assumptions behind them have changed little. In both eras, most people assumed that the offensive use of air power would triumph over the defensive. Those who dissented from that proposition—most recently, the proponents of President Ronald Reagan’s so-called Star Wars program—still shared another widespread assumption, that the problems created by modern military technology could be solved by further advances in it.1 Still another persistent assumption underlay the tendency of nuclear powers to construct modern versions of the shop-window air forces constructed by European rivals on the eve of World War II—forces, that is, designed to intimidate or to demonstrate resolve but often backed by an apparatus of command, logistics, training, and reserves of dubious quality.? In the nuclear age, as in the 1930s, one of the oldest temptations of air power was evident, the temptation to regard it as serving less the needs of battle than the opportunity to avoid it. Given the frightful consequences of actual war, that temptation has only deepened in the nuclear era. More than ever the aerial weapon promises to provide an emblem of great power status, a threat to an enemy’s resolve and psychic stability, and a trump card in diplomatic crises. As an unsurprising consequence of that temptation, new aerial weapons have been accompanied by loose and belatedly assembled military rationales, so that the first impulse is to build and deploy weapons and only later to find a military reason for doing so.  Assumptions that have changed little over more than half a century have
