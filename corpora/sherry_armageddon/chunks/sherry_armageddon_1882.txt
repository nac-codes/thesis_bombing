hem underwent repeated modification.  The continuities of thought and practice in turn easily arouse pessimism about the chance of overcoming the threat of aerial warfare. If both the danger and the ways of thinking about it change so little, what way out can there be? Proposals addressing the danger, advanced with considerable eloquence in a number of recent appeals, would themselves require another book at this point.

Given the frightful consequences of actual war, that temptation has only deepened in the nuclear era. More than ever the aerial weapon promises to provide an emblem of great power status, a threat to an enemy’s resolve and psychic stability, and a trump card in diplomatic crises. As an unsurprising consequence of that temptation, new aerial weapons have been accompanied by loose and belatedly assembled military rationales, so that the first impulse is to build and deploy weapons and only later to find a military reason for doing so.  Assumptions that have changed little over more than half a century have yielded consequences that are distressingly similar. In World War II, the intangible criteria by which the bomber was measured invited escalation in its use. So they often did as well in the Vietnam War, In cold war politics, intangible criteria have invited escalation in the development and deployment of nuclear weapons. If those weapons only had the purpose of destroying targets in the event of war, their numbers still would
