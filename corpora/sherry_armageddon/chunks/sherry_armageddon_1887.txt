htful course. Similarly, Allied bomber forces developed considerable sophistication in guiding their bombs with precision, but in both theaters they generally employed that sophistication to perfect their techniques of destroying cities rather than to steer their bombing back into nar- rower channels.  The problem, then as now, lay partly with the unpredictable consequences of technological change, but even more with the decisions that governments often make, particularly in wartime.

More often, people rushed to embrace dogma, coping with uncertainty by denying it. Before World War II, many people did so by conjuring up the comforting horror of an aerial blitz so terrifying that no nation would unleash it or long survive if the victim of it. Similar reasoning, responsive to visions of far greater horror, generally guided people in the nuclear era.  Most commentators confronting the aerial weapon have offered only two mutually exclusive alternatives: doomsday or deliverance. Designed to alert—to express a sense of the immense danger in an uncertain future—their attempts to view that future in either-or terms nonetheless carried a hidden agenda of seeking certainty by imposing simplicity upon the unpredictable. Even Jonathan Schell’s justly noted The Fate of the Earth, at one level a grim celebration of uncertainty, climaxed with the baldest certitude about the “choice” humankind faced between two paths in the nuclear era: “One leads to death, the other to life.”4  The continuity in habits of thought and practice regarding aerial warfare arose from several circumstances. The sheer magnitude of the danger, unevenly perceived but relentlessly growing, alone invited an apocalyptic outlook. The peculiar impersonality of long-range bombing made it possible both to imagine the worst and to turn away from it. Above all, the power of historical traditi
