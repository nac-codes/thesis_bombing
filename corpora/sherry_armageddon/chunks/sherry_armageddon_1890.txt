e skeptical about technological solutions to the problem of aerial warfare. Of course, such solutions have been recurrently offered in the twentieth century: perhaps precision bombing would replace systematic destruction with selective paralysis, it was argued before World War II, just as others later hoped that precisely guided nuclear weapons might replace “countervalue” incineration of cities with “counterforce” targeting. Or, in another hope running through the history of aerial war (most recently in President Reagan’s proposals), perhaps a new tech- nology would so revive the defensive powers of a nation that an enemy attack might be doomed to failure.  Little in the record of air war supports these hopes for a technological solution. In World War II, antiaircraft defenses showed surprising capacities, inflicting a fearsome toll on both German and Allied bombers, but never enough to stop the aerial offensives before they had run at least some of their frightful course. Similarly, Allied bomber forces developed considerable sophistication in guiding their bombs with precision, but in both theaters they generally employed that sophistication to perfect their techniques of destroying cities rather than to steer their bombing back into nar- rower channels.  The problem, then as now, lay partly with the unpredictable consequences of technological change, but even more with the decisions that governments often make, particularly in wartime. Ignoring standards of rationality that observers like to impose upon war, they may choose, for the variety of reasons explored in this book, to employ new technologies for “irrational” purposes: that is, ones with little military utility or a considerable utility nonetheless overwhelmed by the evils accompanying it. Similarly, whatever current intentions the proponents of the Strategic Defense Initiative may have, their successors may employ the new space technology to different ends. Furthermore, the record of war undermines conf
