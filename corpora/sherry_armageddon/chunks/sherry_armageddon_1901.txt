that people will contribute to the solution of the problem until they are aware of their ability to take part in the solution.”2 Much the same holds true today.  Finally, instruction can be gained from the moral agony some Americans have felt about their nation’s use of the atomic bomb in 1945. That agony often represented a wish to minimize accountability. Since August 1945, concerned Americans have focused on the “decision” to use the atomic bomb as the moment of supreme moral choice. By doing so, they telescoped years of moral action into one instant of responsibility. There has been comfort in establishing neat boundaries to the choice supposedly made. If sin lay in the discrete choice of a few men at a definable moment, then the nation as a whole was not responsible. Circumscribed, the act of moral failure became retrospectively almost reversible: if only Truman had known such and such, if only Stimson had realized this or that. Reversible, the act need not be repeated in the nuclear age Americans entered: the next time, the moment of decision might go the other way.  It is almost as if we could reverse our mental film of the summer of 1945 and give Hiroshima the happy outcome that Kurt Vonnegut so compellingly proposed for Dresden. Billy Pilgrim saw that city’s fate backward:  Page 360 of 368 82%  THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: THE CREATION OF ARMAGEDDON backed off less at the appearance of their enemy’s superiority than at the prospect of nuclear war itself.  Or—to anticipate another objection—it may seem dangerous to think of nuclear explosives merely as weapons of war. To do so seems almost to belittle them or even to accept their employment in war. But it has been one theme of this book that the failure to view aerial weapons as instruments of war that kill and destroy—the habit of looking away from those obvious consequences—has contributed to their growth and encouraged their use. An appreciation of their destructiveness, although seemingly the easiest
