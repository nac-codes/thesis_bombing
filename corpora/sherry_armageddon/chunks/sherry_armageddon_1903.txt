leads to denial of an often instructive example and of the recognition of that heavy inheritance received from an earlier age.  If humility is appropriate, so too is caution in placing blame for the nuclear predicament. There is reason to hesitate before placing it too heavily on the men and women who operate and manage the weapons. They have comprised, episodically at least, a powerful interest group. Particularly during war, the bureaucratic goals they possessed, the technique they commanded, and the pressures under which they operated led them to escalate their use of force in ways often useless, indiscriminate, and unmonitored. Especially since the 1940s, their elaborate links with other interest groups and the economic interests collectively served often have strengthened their voice. And yet military leaders rarely have been the most visionary exponents of air power. Even prophets of air power like Douhet and Mitchell who worked in the armed services usually found their largest audience outside them. Especially in setting forth the more ambitious (and fuzzy) virtues of air power, civilians generally have been more successful, and civilian leaders—Hitler, Churchill, and Roosevelt, albeit in different ways—have been far more subtle and skillful at translating the appeals of air power to a wider audience as well as in developing the practical apparatus for waging air war. In these regards, they have been ably assisted by scientists and other civilian experts.  Responsibility for danger is widespread. Similarly, solutions can arise from many sources beyond the experts. Many technical matters are within the layperson’s grasp, the problem is hardly only technical in nature, and the innocent may bring fresh insights to which professionals, long trapped in debates that run in very narrow channels, may be closed off. In different ways, that potential was shown at the dawn of the air age by H. G. Wells and in its twilight by Jonathan Schell. Even if experts devise good
