s carefully selected targets--factories, shipyards, munitions dumps." Colonel Robert Morgan, who piloted the first bomber to complete twenty-five missions over Europe and who later flew a B-29 over Japan, writes in The Man Who Flew the Memphis Belle: Memoirs of a WWII Bomber Pilot: I will always be proud of the restraint shown in the United States Army Air Forces in those early months of the European air war--the time of the Memphis Belle.

Perret writes that General Doolittle "protested that such an atta
