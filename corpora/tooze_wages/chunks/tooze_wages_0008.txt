Rohland had been a party member since 1933, but the real political muscle on the Main Committee was provided by Karl Otto Saur, Fritz Todt’s pugnacious deputy. Saur, who oversaw tank production uninterruptedly between the summer of 1940 and the end of the war, earned himself a well-justified reputation as one of the war economy’s most fanatical slave-drivers. ee eee en sn ee pe nn ee eee en ee ne eee ee ne ng) ee ee ee pe een ee eee eee ee ee ee eee ee nen een nee ee eee en nnn ne ee ne enn ee eee ne ee ee ee een ee ee ee NO I OO ON NI IE OIE IIE OI EI IIE OID EI ENE mattered was not the total number of tanks, but the number of combat-worthy medium tanks—Mark IIIs, IVs and Czech-made Mark 36- and 38 tanks. If we focus on this group, German tank strength Todt seized the initiative in the bureaucratic battle in the summer of 1940, by attaching a new Main Committee for Tanks to his Ministry for Ammunition and Weapons.16 The basic ingredients for The combination of industrial and political authority provided by Rohland and Saur energized the existing members of the tank cartel as well as enrolling new capacity. By 1941, the Mark III medium tank, which was now replacing the Mark II as the mainstay of the Panzer divisions, was being produced by no less than four different factories-MAN in Nuremberg, MIAG in Brunswick and the Alkett and Daimler-Benz facilities in Berlin.12 Spreading production across so many factories was not calculated to achieve optimal economies of scale, but it was a quick way of expanding capacity. It min- imized disputes between producers and by dispersing production it was to make the German tank industry remarkably insensitive to aerial bombardment. Nor were the preparations for Barbarossa confined to the expansion in the tank force. The programme also assumed a substantial increase in the firepower of the infantry divisions with increases in the number of light field howitzers and the com
