fined to the expansion in the tank force. The programme also assumed a substantial increase in the firepower of the infantry divisions with increases in the number of light field howitzers and the complete replacement of World War I vintage machine guns, still widely used in May 1940, with the modern MG 34.18 Significantly, the programme also specified large-scale upgrades to Germany’s anti-aircraft defences, with particularly high targets set for 8.8 and 10.5 centimetre calibre guns, weapons that competed directly with the artillery requirements of the army. As can be seen from Appendix Table A4, the targets of Ruestungsprogramm B were largely met. Compared to May 1940, the Wehrmacht by the summer of 1941 was increased not only in terms of total manpower, but also firepower.

This shift in emphasis is the defining feature of the German armaments effort between the summer of 1940 and
