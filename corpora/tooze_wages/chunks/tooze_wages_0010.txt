s we have seen, had been Hitler’s number one priority in the first nine months of the war. This shift in emphasis is the defining feature of the German armaments effort between the summer of 1940 and the spring of 1942. And we can better appreciate its significance if we remind ourselves that by July 1940 ammunition accounted for no less than 36 per cent of total armaments production. By the summer of 1941 its share had fallen to less than 20 per cent. Inevitably, this sudden downgrading of ammunition in the priority list must have caused some confusion and a degree of wastage, especially in the heavy engineering sector where artillery shells were made. For the third time, after 1937 and 1939, German industry had tooled up for an ammunition  wen dee ntinn Aeten neler tn Gand ibn ned nen 22s dA ne lee nn nnn Tiaerenerne siernen thn Leen abandon Af nee bi nn 2 nee ln tnd Lee thn nee ne AL TOAD Bh een eel Lanes Lanne clineeed ba anntinsen nen desntinn a4  Page 432 of 800 53% single military operation in recorded history.12 A force numbering no less than 3,050,000 men was involved i in the assault, organized into three gigantic Army Groups operating simultaneously on doubled between May 1940 and June 1941, exactly in proportion to the number of tank divisions.15 There was also a proportional increase in half-tracks, which provided the mobility for 10 divisions Todt seized the initiative in the bureaucratic battle in the summer of 1940, by attaching a new Main Committee for Tanks to his Ministry for Ammunition and Weapons.1£ The basic ingredients for production drive only to find its orders suddenly cancelled. However, given the huge stocks of ammunition accumulated by the summer of 1940, it would have been absurd to continue production at the rates commanded by Hitler six months earlier. By September 1940, the German army had stockpiled no less than 21.9 million 10.5 centimetre howitzer rounds, each of which embodied more than 30 kilos of steel and 3 kilos of precious c
