onths earlier. By September 1940, the German army had stockpiled no less than 21.9 million 10.5 centimetre howitzer rounds, each of which embodied more than 30 kilos of steel and 3 kilos of precious copper.22 For the majority of calibres, there was enough in hand to cover more than twelve months of heavy fighting. Though it did not look good in the arma- ments statistics, halting the overproduction of ammunition was clearly a first priority of rational armaments strategy.21 Given the huge ammunition stocks accumulated by the summer of 1940, steel could be reallocated away from the immediate production of armaments without reducing the effective striking power of the German army. Between the second quarter of 1940 and the second quarter of 1941, the army’s steel ration was cut by more than a third, whilst its striking power increased by roughly the same percentage.22 The steel released from the army was not reallocated towards civilian consumption. In the second half of 1940, the reduction in the army’s steel supply was almost exactly matched by the increased allocation to exports (see Appendix, Table A3). Even after the outbreak of the war, therefore, the requirements of the balance of payments continued to compete with armaments production as one of the chief economic preoccupations of the Nazi regime. As we have seen, Germany was doing its best in 1940 to engineer a massive trade deficit. However, in the twelve months after October 1940 German exports rose by 25 per cent from the trough they had reached in the first summer of the war. This flow of goods was crucial to maintaining Germany’s relations with its Allies, including the Soviet Union, Hungary and Romania, but also with important neutrals such as Spain and Sweden. Indeed, as we have seen, one of the main advocates of wartime exports was the military-economic office of the Wehrmacht, not because it wanted to favour the ‘civilian economy’, but because it viewed continued trade as indispensable to Germany’s s
