ates of wartime exports was the military-economic office of the Wehrmacht, not because it wanted to favour the ‘civilian economy’, but because it viewed continued trade as indispensable to Germany’s survival in a long war. Another clue to interpreting German military-economic strategy in anticipation of Barbarossa can be found in the management of the labour force.23 As in the case of steel, this was arranged so as to allow the army to complete its programme, whilst at the same time releasing resources for other uses. What certainly did not happen was any reduction in the overall level of mobilization. In the immediate aftermath of the defeat of France, German industry had been promised a ‘victory dividend’ in the form of a large reduction in the front-line strength of the army. This decision, however, was reversed within weeks, following Hitler’s order to prepare for an attack on the Soviet Union. After dipping briefly from a strength of 5.767 million in June 1940, the Wehrmacht began to grow  Page 433 of 800 53% nee eee eee se eee we oe ee ee ee nen ee eee ne ee ee nee ee eee ee oe ee ene ee ne ee ee eee ee eee ee nee en eee e ee nen in ee ene nee nee ee eee ew ee ee FN OF ON RD NDE Ne RID ND IID DAD Net ON BIA DIANA EDN Be NBER Ne DD DDE was 40 per cent, the production of U-boats more than tripled.142 What has tended to obscure this considerable growth in the production of weaponry is the simultaneous decline in the production again in the autumn of 1940, reaching a total of 7.3 million men by the following summer. Teenaged cohorts provided roughly 660,000 men per annum. But a large part of this increase was attribut- able to a further extension of the draft to men previously exempted on grounds of their importance to the war economy. Compared to May 1940, the workforce census of May 1941 counted an add- itional 1.4 million workers as having been called up for military service. By the summer of 1941, the population of German men between the ages of 16 and 56 had
