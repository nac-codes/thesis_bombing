Due to the small number of children born during World War I, Germany had no option but to send virtually all its young men into battle.25 Of those aged family men, the backbone of the armaments industries, that any future recruitment would have to draw.26 Barbarossa was a Blitzkrieg campaign also in this sense. The best available manpower summer. By implication, however, the industrial effort to complete Ruestungsprogramm B by April 1941 was time-limited.22 Once the Ostheer (the German Army in the East) began to build to its maximum strength ready for the actual invasion of the Soviet Union, German industry would be stripped of some of its most valuable workers and industrial output was bound to suffer. After the ‘armaments holiday’ of the winter, the German economy would take a ‘war holiday’. This, of course, was on the assumption that the Barbarossa campaign would be brief. Hitler promised his soldiers that they would be back at their workbenches by the end of August.28 As late as the last weeks of October 1941, the Wehrmacht was still planning for the imminent dissolution of one-third of the army’s strength and the redirection of hundreds of thousands of soldiers to the production of weapons for war against Britain and the United States.22  What we would like to know, of course, is how efficiently German industry used the limited quantity of labour that was at its disposal in 1940 and 1941. Given the very bold claims that have been made about the character of the German industrial war effort, it is perhaps worth reminding ourselves that before the war it was accepted that German manufacturing was easily on a par with Great Britain and second only to the United States in terms of productive efficiency. Nevertheless, an entire narrative of ‘inefficiency, egotism and incompetence’ has been built on a set of rather rough data which appear to show a catastrop
