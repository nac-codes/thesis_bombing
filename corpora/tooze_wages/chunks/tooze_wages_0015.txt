ed States in terms of productive efficiency. Nevertheless, an entire narrative of ‘inefficiency, egotism and incompetence’ has been built on a set of rather rough data which appear to show a catastrophic collapse in labour productivity in the first years of the war.22 This result is obtained by comparing statistics for the number of people working for the Wehrmacht between 1939 and 1941 with the most widely cited indicator of armaments production. According to these sources, whereas the Wehrmacht workforce doubled, armaments production increased by only 70 per cent between 1939 and 1941. Indeed, in the case of the Luftwaffe it has been claimed that an increase in workforce of 50 per cent between 1939 and 1941 raised output by only 15 per cent.31 Both comparisons, if they were true, would imply a disastrous fall in output per worker. But in fact these claims should carry a severe health warning.
