Indeed, in the case of the Luftwaffe it has been claimed that an in e in workforce of 50 per cent between 1939 and 1941 raised output by only 15 per Workers reported Armaments as working for output index Wehrmacht cent.31 Both comparisons, if they were true, would imply a disastrous fall in output per worker. But in fact these claims should carry a severe health warnir he statistics on which they are based are 140 120 100 80 60 as working for output index 40 20 Jun-1939 Dec-1939 Jul-1940 Jan-1941 Feb-1942 Figure 17. Labour input and armaments output (1st quarter 1940=100)  Figure 17 shows a new calculation of the monthly index of armaments production plotted against a revised estimate of the armaments workforce. 22 Despite monthly fluctuations, the general move- ment of the series is parallel, suggesting no collapse in productivity. There may have been some underperformance in the later months of 1941. But this is hardly surprising given the disruption caused by the mobilization for Barbar The transport system was again in disarray and whilst the overall number of Wehrmacht workers continued to increase, production was disrupted by the drafting  of key personnel. There are serious problems in going beyond this kind of broad-brush statement, because of the difficulty of obtaining truly comparable measures for both production and the work- force in the armaments sector. In the case of the army and navy there was almost certainly no deterioration in labour productivity, because as we have seen the output of army equipment and naval vessels grew quite dramatically between 1940 and 1941, whereas the labour force in the army plants expanded by only
