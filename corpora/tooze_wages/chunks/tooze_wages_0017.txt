labour productivity, because as we have seen the output of army equipment and naval vessels grew quite dramatically between 1940 and 1941, whereas the labour force in the army plants expanded by only 20 per cent and in the navy’s case by as little as 7 per cent.33 Any shortfall due to the reduction in ammunition production must be described as the outcome of deliberate volicv rather than inefficiencv. The most likelv susvect for a productivitv decline in the run-up to Barbaro:  Aug-1941 by the mobilization for Barbarossa. The transport system was again in disarray and whilst the overall number of Wehrmacht workers continued to increase, production was disrupted by the drafting of key personnel. There are serious problems in going beyond this kind of broad-brush statement, because of the difficulty of obtaining truly comparable measures for both production and the w to the reduction in ammunition production must be described as the outcome of deliberate policy rather than inefficiency. The most likely suspect for a productivity decline in the run-up to Barbarossa is the Luftwaffe, where most of the increase in the official ‘Wehrmacht’ labour force was recorded between 1940 and 1941. The official figures for Luftwaffe employment, which are inflated by an uncertain margin, do show a 40 per cent increase in the Luftwaffe workforce between the spring of 1940 and the autumn of 1941.34 When compared to figures for aircraft output, this would imply stagnation in labour productivity in 1941 but certainly no collapse. As will be discussed below, there were specific technical factors impeding aircraft production in Germany in 1940-41. And this sector, too, suffered from the disruption caused by Barbarossa. More importantly, however, hasty comparisons of output and employment in 1941 take no account of the fact that ai t production takes time-at least six months from raw material to finished aircraft. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the large increase in the Luftwaffe
