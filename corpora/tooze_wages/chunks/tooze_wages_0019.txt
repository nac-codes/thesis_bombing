Union as a foregone conclusion, Hitler sketched a future of boundless possibilities, in which Germany would wage a ‘battle of the continents’, by which he clearly meant a war with the United States.37 To secure this future of global power, German armaments strategy in 1941 needed to be directed as much towards investment in future capacity as towards current production. In the prelude to Barbarossa, therefore, the army, the Four Year Plan and the Luftwaffe all engaged in substantial investment drives. Coming on top of the expansion programmes set in motion in 1938 and the more targeted investment triggered by the Fuehrer’s ammunition programme of early 1940, the result was an investment boom, the like of which had never before been seen by German industry.38  As far as the German army was concerned, the chief priorities were tanks and explosives. Despite the enormous scale of operation Barbarossa, the German army shared the view that the ultimate military enemies of the Third Reich were Britain and the United States. Furthermore, the army anticipated that after victory in the East it would struggle to assert itself against the rival claims of the Luftwaffe and the navy. As an alternative to the air and naval war, the army’s staff therefore devised a variety of operations through which it might strike at the British Empire in Western Asia. Once the Soviet Union had been defeated, powerful armoured columns would be launched into the Middle East and northern India from bases in Libya, Anatolia and the Caucasus. To deliver this death blow,  Page 438 of 800 54% Figure 17 shows a new calculation of the monthly index of armaments production plotted against a revised estimate of the armaments workforce. 32 Despite monthly fluctuations, the general move- with a major reorganization of the war effort in the spring of 1942. In fact, the evidence suggests that we should look to preparations begun at least a year earlier.3> In any case, as surprising as this may seem, the key t
