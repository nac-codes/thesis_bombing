tion of the war effort in the spring of 1942. In fact, the evidence suggests that we should look to preparations begun at least a year earlier.3> In any case, as surprising as this may seem, the key to understanding German armaments strategy in 1941 is to recognize that, unlike in the first months of the war, it was not directed primarily the Generals dreamed of a vast fleet of 36 Panzer divisions, 15,000 strong.22 An internal planning document produced by the army in May 1941 called for the production of almost 40,000 tanks and 130,000 half-tracks over the next three years.42 These schemes for a Eurasian war ona scale not seen since Alexander the Great have generally been dismissed as little more than thought-experiments. In fact, however, tank production by the end of the war comfortably exceeded the quantities specified in the army’s Mesopotamian fantasy.*! And this increase in production was only possible because the army’s post-Barbarossa planning did not remain on paper.42 In 1941 hundreds of millions of Reichsmarks were invested in the tank industry. In Kassel, Henschel & Sohn added almost a hundred thousand square metres of new floor space. A gigantic new plant, the Nibelungen works, was opened at Sankt Valentin, Austria, and two new factories-Vomag at Plauen and the Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen-were converted to tank production.43 The year 1941 also saw an important shift in technological terms. Germany finally abandoned large-scale production of obsolete light tanks and concentrated all available energies on the medium tank designs that were to see the Wehrmacht through to the summer of 1943. Furthermore, the decision was taken to accelerate the development of two new heavy tanks, specifically intended to counter the remarkable T-34 and KV-1 vehicles that caused so much trouble to the German forces in Russia. Like that of the Luftwaffe, the future of the German tank force was decided, not in 1942 or 1943, but in the summer and autumn of 1941.  The tank pr
