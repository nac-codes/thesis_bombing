y was a renewed effort to expand synthetic fuel capacity, another was the conquest of the Caucasus. In 1941 and 1942 the Third Reich pursued both. Over the winter of 1940-41 Carl Krauch, now acting both as chairman of IG Farben’s supervisory board and as chemicals supremo in the Four Year Plan, moved once again to the centre of the German war effort.4= As General Thomas later noted, Krauch took the question of ‘USA-competition’ very seriously.4® His first priority, therefore, was to increase dramatically the production of air fuel. The second priority was rubber. In November 1940 Krauch instructed IG Farben to expand its three existing Buna plants and to build a fourth facility in the newly acquired Polish territories, sufficiently far to the east to be safe from the threat of British bombers. In February 1941 he set fuel expansion targets that aimed to raise Germany’s production from 4.3 million tons expected in 1941 to more than 6 million tons by 1943.42 The longer-term goal, first envisioned in 1938, was to achieve production of more than 10 million tons of oil by 1945.
