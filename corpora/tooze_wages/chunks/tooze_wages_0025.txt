It was first identified by Krauch’s staff as a site for one of the new generation of hydrogenation plants, to be built by an IG licensee. But in December 1940 IG Farben itself scouted the site for its top-priority rubber plant and by February 1941 they had arranged with the SS for the transfer of an industrial terrain measuring 8 by 3 kilometres, just to the east of Auschwitz. At this point, the small prison camp occupied by the SS in Auschwitz did not figure prominently in Himmler’s planning, but in due course Krauch, IG and the SS were all to dramatically scale up their ambitions. In industrial terms, Auschwitz came to be conceived not simply as a Buna factory, but as a complex state-of-the-art chemicals facility, suitable for the production of Buna, methanol, carbide and iso-octane, the crucial additive for the Luftwaffe’s air fuel. The final budget for the Auschwitz plant was 776 million Reichsmarks, making it the largest single investment in the entire portfolio of the Four Year Plan. At least 610 million Reichsmarks were actually spent by the end of the war.42 In terms of sheer scale, the chemicals plant dw d the expanding extermination centre that the SS established just a mile to the west.
