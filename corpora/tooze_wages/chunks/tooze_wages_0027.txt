Nor was Auschwitz Auschwitz site. Altogether, the Upper Silesian chemicals complex must have consumed in the order of 1.3 billion Reichsmarks, or roughly 13 billion euros in modern money. claimed the lives of at least 30,000 inmates.2! In light of such horror, it is easier to think of Auschwitz as a place of pure negativity, of destruction pure and simple.22 Unfortunately, however, the reality one-tenth of the total supply of methanol. Heydebreck was scheduled for twice that much. When British and American bombers started doing serious damage to IG Farben’s plant at Leuna in 1944, the Silesian complex stood ready. According to the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, Auschwitz and Heydebreck ‘came to the rescue’ of the German war effort in 1944.55 By the end of 1944 Auschwitz was responsible for 15 per cent of Germany’s methanol production and, in acknowledgement of the plant’s success, Dr Johann Giesen, the man responsible for the Auschwitz fuel pro- gramme, was nominated by Speer’s Armaments Ministry to take charge of the methanol sector across the Reich. Though it is certainly true that the expenditure of resources in Silesia was out of all proportion to the net benefit received, this was a question of timing, not inherent logic. The chief beneficiaries of Krauch’s huge investment programme turned out to be the Soviets, who dismantled much
