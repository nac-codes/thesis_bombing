would be the first to face the terrifying industrial might of the United States. It was in the air war that the Germans really feared the American contribution to the Allied war effort. Roosevelt's Luftwaffe’s development programme. The aircraft that were already in production had proved themselves unable to achieve a decisive victory over the Royal Air Force. The Junkers 88 medium bomber was far from being the war-winning universal combat aircraft that had been sold to Goering in 1938. A battlefield report commissioned from squadrons stationed on the Channel coast recorded that the aircrew were ‘not afraid of the enemy, but were afraid of the Junker 88’.52 It was slow, it lacked effective defensive armament and for strategic bombing its payload was hopelessly inadequate. With upgraded engines, both the older-generation medium bombers, the He 111 and the Do 17, proved capable of outperforming the Ju 88, their designated successor. And this was no mere technicality. The Luftwaffe’s entire industrial plan since 1938 had been built around the primacy of the Ju 88, the Junkers corporation and Heinrich Koppenberg, its CEO. To call into question the qualities of the Ju 88 was to call into question the entire basis of Luftwaffe development over the previous three years, as well as hundreds of millions of Reichsmarks of investment.  The Luftwaffe’s other main aircraft, the Messerschmitt Bf 109 was an excellent short-range fighter-interceptor, but it had been in operation since the Spanish Civil War and it could be kept competitive only by repeated upgrading. Over the winter of 1940-41 the difficulties of getting the Bf 109 E, or ‘Emil’, into production accounted for a large part of the sharp dip in aircraft production ATAUCITS Stall do da sil LOL OLE OF Lille TIEW EeiMeratiOl OF MYALOESN AMO!
