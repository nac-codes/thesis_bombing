According to the records of the Four Year Plan, no less than 2.5 billion Reichsmarks were channelled into Krauch’s chemicals projects in 1940 and 1941.26 this aircraft was turning into one of the great development disasters of the war.62 The same could also be said of Heinkel’s long-range strategic bomber, the four-engined He 177. The future of the Luftwaffe as a strategic weapon, and Heinkel’s future as a major aircraft developer, depended on the performance of this plane. A dedicated factory annexe had been built at Heinkel’s state-funded plant in Oranienburg, laid out specifically to enable the large-scale employment of concentration camp labour, a major new experiment for the armaments industries.£1 However, thanks largely to its absurd specifications, which called for dive-bombing capability, the He 177 was a disaster. Its wings were prone to falling off and its peculiar back-to-back engine configuration resulted in frequent self-combustion.§2 In light of these technical difficulties, it is hardly surprising that the Reich Air Ministry in early 1941 found it hard to come up with a coherent long-range production plan. The Luftwaffe urgently needed a new generation of aircraft and this seemed all the more important given the worrying news about the American plans for mass-production. Germany’s only hope, it seemed, was to counter quantity with quality. As the Luftwaffe chief of staff put it, in far from optimistic tones, in September 1941: ‘If there is any
