in aircraft production were laid well before the results began to make themselves felt in 1942. In 1940, thanks to the huge expansion undertaken by the Wehrmacht, Germany was the world’s leader in aluminium production, with annual output of 300,000 tons. In the autumn of 1940, however, officials in the Reich Air Ministry and the Four Year Plan were alarmed by the news that the United States was planning to raise its production to 450,000 tons by 1942.64 To counter this threat, the Reich embarked on a gigantic European scheme, to be centred on Norway. As a result of its natural endowment with mineral wealth and abundant hydroelectricity, Norway in the inter- war period had become a hub for European ore mining and metal smelting. The industry was largely foreign-owned and thus susceptible to immediate German penetration. For Heinrich Koppenberg, it was an opportunity to realize his Fordist vision of a fully integrated aircraft conglomerate, producing everything from the raw material to the finished product.®> Eager to forestall any move by the established German aluminium producers, Koppenberg descended on Norway even before the fighting was over. By the end of the year, he had established a German-owned aluminium syndicate whose aim was to quadruple Norwegian production from 45,900 tons to at least 200,000 tons by 1944. This gigantic programme was costed initially at 300-400 million Reichsmarks and it was to be a truly pan-European affair. Bauxite and other raw materials were to be transported to Norway from France, Croatia and Greece. Norway would do the smelting. Then the raw aluminium would be shipped south for processing at Junkers’ plants in central Germany. By the summer of 1941, as the Luftwaffe scaled up its aircraft production plans, Koppenberg adjusted the scale of the aluminium programme accordingly. By June he was discussing with Goering a scheme to raise production within the German Grossraum to no less than 1 million tons, costed at 1.5 billion Reichsm
