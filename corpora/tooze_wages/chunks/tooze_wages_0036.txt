le of the aluminium programme accordingly. By June he was discussing with Goering a scheme to raise production within the German Grossraum to no less than 1 million tons, costed at 1.5 billion Reichsmarks.  Koppenberg was also the driving force behind the proposal to build a gigantic new aero-engine factory.66 The idea of an ‘American-style’ factory for the mass-production of aero-engines had been discussed in Berlin at least since 1938. But in the autumn of 1940 it took on a new urgency. In November 1940 Koppenberg reported to one of Ernst Heinkel’s representatives in Berlin that the  Ane et a one nt a ee 2 ne te te 2 2 ta tt AA A ne BT a a nd 8 fo a ne ed Hee  Page 445 of 800 55% this aircraft was turning into one of the great development disasters of the war.£2 The same could also be said of Heinkel’s long-range strategic bomber, the four-engined He 177. The future of the it was an opportunity to realize his Fordist vision of a fully integrated aircraft conglomerate, producing everything from the raw material to the finished product.®2 Eager to forestall any move by Koppenberg was also the driving force behind the proposal to build a gigantic new aero-engine factory.6© The idea of an ‘American-style’ factory for the mass-production of aero-engines had been Americans were planning to build a new motorworks with a capacity of 1,000 motors per month.£7 According to Koppenberg, the ‘only way’ to meet this challenge was for Germany also to build anew plant of similar dimensions, capable of reaping the full benefits of mass-production. In November 1940 Koppenberg had the Junkers engineering office draw up a plan for a thousand-engine plant to supply the engine needs of the Ju 288. By May 1941 Junkers was lobbying for an allocation of no less than 685 million Reichsmarks to build the Flugmotorenwerke Ostmark (FMO) safely beyond the reach of Allied bombers, in Austria. In practice, the FMO was to become one of the truly disastrous investments of the Third Reich.£8 After
