build the Flugmotorenwerke Ostmark (FMO) safely beyond the reach of Allied bombers, in Austria. In practice, the FMO was to become one of the truly disastrous investments of the Third Reich.£8 After two changes of management, the ‘thousand-engine plant’ reached its maximum output in 1944 at the very modest rate of only 198 engines per month. The travails of the FMO, however, should not distract from the real expansion in aero-engine capacity that was set in motion in the autumn of 1940.82 Most of the investment flowed, not into green- field sites, but into existing aero-engine and airframe plants, such as Daimler-Benz’s plant at Genshagen, which provided a precise counterpoint to the FMO debacle. In September 1940, at the same time as Koppenberg was conceiving his grandiose white elephant, Daimler-Benz agreed to raise the capacity of its main aero-engine facility from 350 engines per month to 800, at a comparatively modest capital cost of only 50 million Reichsmarks. In the summer of 1941, the target was raised to 1,200 engines per month, now requiring an investment of 170 million Reichsmarks. In practice, the rate of return at Genshagen turned out to be even better than this. With an investment of only 98 million Reichsmarks, Daimler by the second quarter of 1944 reached an output of no less than 1,200 engines per month.20 And Daimler’s expansion was compounded by investments at the other plants producing its DB 605 engine under licence. Without this investment, initiated in 1940-41, the enormous increase in the production of Me 109 fighters later in the war would simply not have been possible. In total, it is claimed that the Luftwaffe industries sank 5.18 billion Reichsmarks into expansion between September 1939 and January 1942, a figure so large as to seem implausible. 21 We can say with more certainty that between December 1940 and March 1941 the Reich Air Ministry author- ized investments totalling 762.8 million Reichsmarks, of which 533.4 million were direc
