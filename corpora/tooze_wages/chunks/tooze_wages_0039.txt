with representatives of the OKW, State Secretary Milch announced that, as of 1 May 1941, German intelligence believed that combined British and American output had exceeded that of Germany and Italy. The United States alone was turning out 2,800 high-performance aero-engines per month. On current trends, Anglo-American output would be twice that of the Axis by the end of 1942. ‘There is not a minute to lose... ’, Milch declared. By the summer of 1942 Germany needed to increase its production of aircraft by 150 per cent, to roughly 3,000 planes per month.74 The precise target set by Milch was new, but not the basic thrust of his comments. As we have seen, the expansion in productive capacity had already begun in the autumn of 1940. Milch’s new target of 3,000 aircraft per month, however, required a further scaling up. Since earlier in the year Krauch had been envisioning a medium-term increase in the production of air fuel from 1 to 1.5 million tons. Now he raised his target to no less than 3 million tons. Given the cost of the hydrogenation process, it was unrealistic to assume that this could be produced from German coal. Hydrogenation \ was simply too expensive. Krauch’s promise therefore hinged a. oe ee ee ta ee a a ee ae tt tae tet tt a ee er eS | Americans were planning to build a new motorworks with a capacity of 1,000 motors per month.£2 According to Koppenberg, the ‘only way’ to meet this challenge was for Germany also to build a new per month.2° And Daimler’s expansion was compounded by investments at the other plants producing its DB 605 engine under licence. Without this investment, initiated in 1940-41, the enormous between September 1939 and January 1942, a figure so large as to seem implausible. 71 We can say with more certainty that between December 1940 and March 1941 the Reich Air Ministry author- turning out 2,800 high-performance aero-engines per month.
