attle, as in France, in the first weeks of the campaign. This was the assumption on which Barbarossa was premised.78 A massive central thrust towards Moscow, accompanied by flanking encirclements of the Soviet forces trapped in the north and south, would allow the Red Army to be broken on the Dnieper—Dvina river line within 500 kilometres of the Polish-German border. The Dnieper—Dvina river line was critical because beyond that Page 449 of 800 55% field sites, but into existing aero-engine and airframe plants, such as Daimler-Benzs plant at Genshagen, which provided a precise counterpoint to the FMO debacle. In September 1940, at the same time per month.2° And Daimler’s expansion was compounded by investments at the other plants producing its DB 605 engine under licence. Without this investment, initiated in 1940-41, the enormous annum.2Z5 Here was the perverse logic of Barbarossa in a nutshell. The conquest of the oilfields of the Caucasus, 2,000 kilometres deep in the Soviet Union, was not treated as the awesome military- communications would hamper their efforts to restore coherence no less than it impeded the German advance.7Z Everything depended on deciding the battle, as in France, in the first weeks of the and south, would allow the Red Army to be broken on the Dnieper-Dvina river line within 500 kilometres of the Polish-German border. The Dnieper—Dvina river line was critical because beyond that point logistical constraints on the German army were binding.22 These limitations on Germany’s new style of ‘Blitzkrieg’ had not been obvious in 1940, because the depth of operations required by Manstein’s encircling blow (Sichelschnitt) had never exceeded a few hundred kilometres. The entire operation could therefore be supplied by trucks shuttling back and forth from the German border. On the basis of their experience in France, the Wehrmacht’s logistical staff calculated that the efficient total range for trucks was 600 kilometres, giving an operational depth of 3
