with which the Wehrmacht could build up forward supply bases to support a second 500 kilometre advance. The problems the Germans encountered in adapting Russia’s narrow-gauge railway lines are well known. To make matters worse, the retreating Red Army became extremely proficient at communications would hamper their efforts to restore coherence no less than it impeded the German advance.22 Everything depended on deciding the battle, as in France, in the first weeks of the and south, would allow the Red Army to be broken on the Dnieper—Dvina river line within 500 kilometres of the Polish-German border. The Dnieper—Dvina river line was critical because beyond that point logistical constraints on the German army were binding.72 These limitations on Germany’s new style of ‘Blitzkrieg’ had not been obvious in 1940, because the depth of operations required by destruction on the Dnieper-Dvina river line, the Wehrmacht would not be able to engage in hot pursuit, because it would first need to replenish its supply bases closer to the front line. After that, all evacuating rolling stock and sabotaging bridges, tracks and other railway installations. However, the problems were more fundamental than this and were evident already at the planning stage. The existing Russian rail infrastructure, even if it had been captured intact, was insufficient to support the German army. As a rule of thumb, German logistical experts liked to assign at least one high- capacity railway line to each army-sized unit. But for the ten armies with which they invaded the Soviet Union, the Wehrmacht was able to assign only three main railway lines, one for each army group.8! And the situation for Army Group Centre, where the bulk of the German forces were to be concentrated, was particularly bad. From the outset, therefore, the German army had to assume that not all units would be equally well supplied. Critical stores were to be reserved above all for the main strike force of 33 tank and motorized in
