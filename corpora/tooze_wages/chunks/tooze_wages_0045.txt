outset, therefore, the German army had to assume that not all units would be equally well supplied. Critical stores were to be reserved above all for the main strike force of 33 tank and motorized infantry divisions. If the battle extended much beyond the first months of the attack, the fighting power of the rest of the German army would dwindle rapidly. Fundamentally, the Wehrmacht was a ‘poor army’.82 The fast-striking motorized element of the German army in 1941 consisted of only 33 divisions out of 130. Three-quarters of the German army continued to rely on more traditional means of traction: foot and horse. The German army in 1941 invaded the Soviet Union with somewhere between 600,000 and 750,000 horses.83 The horses were not for riding. They were for moving guns, ammunition and supplies. Weeks prior to the invasion, 15,000 Panje carts were issued to the infantry units that would trail behind the fast-moving Panzers. The vast majority of Germany’s soldiers marched into Russia, as they had into France, on foot. Of course, things would have been better if Germany had had three times as many tanks and trucks. But to imagine a fully motorized Wehrmacht, poised for an attack on the Soviet Union, is a fantasy of the Cold War, not a realistic vision of the possibilities in 1941. To be more specific, it is an American fantasy. The Anglo-American invasion force of 1944 was the only military force in World War II to fully conform to the modern model of a motorized army. The German army was not poor in motor transport because it had neglected to prepare properly. It was poor because of the incomplete industrial and economic development of Germany itself. Most German freight transport in the 1940s was accomplished by rail. For short distances, the horse was still essential in both town and countryside. Of course, the German motor vehicle industry might have been coaxed into producing more trucks. But the basic constraint on the use of motor vehicles in wartime Europe was
