The German army in 1941 invaded the Soviet Union with somewhere between 600,000 and 750,000 horses.82 The horses were and the Soviet Union. According to the best modern estimates, German per capita GDP was two and a half times that in the Soviet Union in 1940. On this basis there was good reason to think that the huge quantitative advantage apparently enjoyed by the Red Army would turn out to be illusory. The far greater organizational capacity of the Wehrmacht, the superior quality of its equipment and the greater training of its soldiers would carry the day. After all, this was the army that had defeated the combined forces of France, the British Expeditionary Force, Belgium and the Netherlands in six weeks. By launching its army against the Soviet Union, rather than prosecuting a direct air and sea assault on Britain and its backers in the United States, the Third Reich was not making an irrational strategic choice.8> It was deploying its best weapon against what still appeared to be the ‘weakest link in the chain’.  Not that the Germans were oblivious to the modernization of the Soviet Union since World War I. As the Wehrmacht’s own economic staff well knew, Stalin’s Five Year Plans had substantially transformed the geography of the Soviet economy. According to credible Western estimates we now believe that Stalin’s regime increased total industrial output by 2.6 times between 1928 and 1940, and armaments output grew by vastly more.8§ In their haste to industrialize, the Soviet planners had placed a large amount of investment in Western economic zones vulnerable to the German onslaught.82 But as the planners
