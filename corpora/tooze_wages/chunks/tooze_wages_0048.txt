grew by vastly more.8§ In their haste to industrialize, the Soviet planners had placed a large amount of investment in Western economic zones vulnerable to the German onslaught.82 But as the planners in Berlin fully understood, the First Five Year Plan of 1928-32 had established a new Soviet industrial base, safely to the east of the Urals, which had the capacity to sustain a self-sufficient population of at least 40 million people.88 Even if an invader managed to overrun a large part of the western Soviet Union, war production could continue at new industrial centres, such as the gigantic engineering works at Sverdlovsk. Overall, Soviet industrial capacity was clearly very substantial. In 1939 the German steel association put the Soviet Union well ahead of Great Britain, in third place behind the United States and Germany, with an annual output of 18 million tons of steel, compared to Germany’s 23.3 million tons.82 And on paper at least the Red Army was a formidable force. Throughout the spring of 1941 Franz Halder recorded Hitler’s ruminations about the Soviets’ immense stocks of tanks and aircraft.20 Hitler knew that the Soviets had modern capacity railway line to each army-sized unit. but for the ten armies with whicn they invaded the soviet Union, the Wehrmacnt was able to assign only three main railway lines, one for each army was a formidable force. Throughout the spring of 1941 Franz Halder recorded Hitler’s ruminations about the Soviets’ immense stocks of tanks and aircraft.22 Hitler knew that the Soviets had modern aircraft and ‘mammoth’ tanks with enormous guns. But he comforted himself with the fact that most of the Red Army’s equipment was obsolete. On the assumption that the Wehrmacht would be able to achieve a massed concentration at strategic points he was happy to predict that the Soviets would ‘crumple under the massive impact of our tanks and planes’. No one, however, could deny the sheer vastness of the Soviet Union, and this alone made Barbaros
