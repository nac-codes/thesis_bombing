the Urals, which had the capacity to a bad situation will be made worse.’25 As in the autumn of 1939, therefore, Hitler and Halder were fundamentally at odds. As in 1939-40, Germany’s entire future was at stake. But unlike in 1939, prevail. Above all, however, everyone agreed in hoping that the main work of destruction could be done on the Dnieper-Dvina river line. Another latent disagreement is revealed by Halder’s comment that the conquest of the Soviet Union would not ‘significantly improve’ Germany’s ‘economic base’. This is remarkable because it flies in the face of Hitler’s fundamental assumption about the profits to be gained from conquest, particularly of the Ukraine. Until the middle of February 1941, however, it was Halder’s pessimistic assess- ment that reflected the mainstream view in Berlin. The army’s military-geographic study of the Soviet Union, finished on 10 August 1940, expected much from the conquest of the Ukraine, but it ruled out any consideration of the Caucasus oilfields as being beyond the immediate reach of even the Panzer divisions. It also emphasized the considerable Soviet industrial potential beyond the German reach in the Urals.26 In October, a staffer at the Moscow embassy, Gebhardt von Walther, forwarded an even more pessimistic assessment to Halder. This warned against expecting any immediate Soviet collapse following a German attack and played down the benefits to be expected from the Ukraine. The territory was even more overpopulated and impoverished that it had been when it fell into German hands in 1917, and it had been a disappointment then.22 In January 1941, both the military-economic staff of the Wehrmacht and the offices of the Four Year Plan were hard at work on negative assessments. On 22 January 1941 General Thomas's staff pointed out that an invasion would interrupt deliveries of alloy metals such as manganese, for which the Soviet Union was currently Germany’s only source of supply.28 Furthermore, any major offensive
