pointed out that an invasion would interrupt deliveries of alloy metals such as manganese, for which the Soviet Union was currently Germany’s only source of supply.28 Furthermore, any major offensive would accelerate the depletion of Germany’s already inadequate stocks of fuel and rubber.22 Similar conclusions had been reached by the offices of the Four Year Plan. The only significant exception was State Secretary Backe of the Agriculture Ministry, who had long been an advocate of expansion towards the east. What precisely Backe said to Hitler in January 1941 was not clear even to insiders such as General Thomas. As one OKW memo put it: ‘It is said that State Secretary Backe has informed the Fuehrer that possession of the Ukraine would relieve us of any economic worry. Actually what Backe is supposed to have said is that if any territory could help us, it was the Ukraine.

In any case, in the light of reports he was receiving about Hitler’s own view of the campaign, General Thomas engineered an abrupt about-turn in the view taken by his staff.101 On 22 January 1941 Thomas had informed his boss, Keitel, that he was planning to submit a report urging caution with regard to the military-economic benefits of the invasion.122 Now he reversed direction. As it became clear that Hitler was justifying Barbarossa first and foremost as a campaign of economic conquest, Thomas began systematically working towards the Fuehrer. He instructed his staff to collaborate closely with Backe in formulating plans for the agricultural exploitation of the Soviet Union, a decision that was vindicated in the second wee
