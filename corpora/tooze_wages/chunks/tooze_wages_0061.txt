the West had been forced on Germany by the world Jewish conspiracy pulling the strings in London and Washington.4 From the moment that Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, the genocidal impulses of Nazi ideology towards both the Jews and the Slavs had taken on concrete form in an extraordinary programme of population displacement and colonial settlement.2 The architects of this programme were Heinrich Himmler and his technical staffs in the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA) and the offices of the Reichskommissar fuer die Festigung deutschen Volkstums (RKF). The practical success of this early programme was limited. But it was crucial in establishing the close connection in SS thinking between the removal of the Jews and the wider project of racial reorganization and Germanic settlement.  As we have seen, the idea of colonial settlement in the East had long been central to radical German nationalism. In 1939 this was compounded by two more immediate impulses. The incorporation of a large part of Polish territory into the Reich faced Germany with the question of what to do with millions of new, non-German inhabitants. On the other hand, agreements reached with the Soviet Union and Italy in September and October 1939 meant that Germany had to accommodate the ‘return’ to the Reich of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans from the Baltic and South Tyrol. To make room for this influx, the SS prepared to remove both the entire Jewish population and the vast majority of the Polish inhabitants from the Polish territory now annexed to the Reich.4 One early version of the Generalplan specified the goal of deporting 1 million Jews and 3.4 million Poles.2 The only native inhabitants who were to remain were the small minority judged fit for incorporation into the German racial community, plus an ample supply of forced labour. This proved wildly over-ambitious. In early 1940 Himmler and Heydrich hoped to drive 600,000 people out of the newly annexed territory and into the Ge
