community, plus an ample supply of forced labour. This proved wildly over-ambitious. In early 1940 Himmler and Heydrich hoped to drive 600,000 people out of the newly annexed territory and into the General Government. To do so, however, would have produced chaos. By April 1940 ‘only’ 261,517 people had been displaced, half Jews, half Polish peasants. By the end of 1940 the total had risen to 305,000. Instead of removing the Jews, the German administrators resorted to concentrating them in large urban ghettos, the largest at Lodz. Millions of Poles, meanwhile, were conscripted for work in Germany or for forced labour on formerly Polish soil. By the end of 1940, 180,000 ethnic Germans had been settled on Polish farms, a process accompanied by brutal evictions and much publicity. However, the numerical imbalance remained frustrating. By January 1941 more than 530,000 ethnic Germans had been repatriated to the Reich, having left behind farms and  Page 461 of 800 57% programme of population displacement and colonial settlement. The architects of this programme were Heinrich Himmler and his technical staffs in the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA) and the the total had risen to 305,000. Instead of removing the Jews, the German administrators resorted to concentrating them in large urban ghettos, the largest at Lddz. Millions of Poles, meanwhile, were other property in their original homeland valued at no less than 3.315 billion Reichsmarks.® But instead of taking over prime agricultural settlements, the majority of the returnees found themselves languishing in SS-run transit camps.  This practical failure, however, did not deflate the enthusiasm of Heydrich and the SS. As of September 1940, the process of racial sifting began in earnest with the introduction of the Volksliste. Of 8.53 million Poles within Germany’s borders, only 1 million were deemed worthy of inclusion in this list. They were ranked into four classes according to the speed with which the SS ‘racial scient
