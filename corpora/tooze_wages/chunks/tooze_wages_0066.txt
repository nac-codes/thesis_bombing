Over the following twelve months the evolution of policy towards the Jews and the development of long-term planning for the settlement of Eastern Europe were pushed forward in constant inter- change between the offices of the RSHA, the RKF and the SS economic administration.14 The first sketch of the so-called Generalplan Ost was finished in a matter of weeks by the RKF’s settlement expert, Professor Konrad Meyer. It was presented to Himmler as early as 15 July 1941. In the autumn the order was given to construct a number of base camps in Poland from which slave-labour columns would begin the enormous construction programme called for by Meyer’s Generalplan. Meanwhile, Reinhard Heydrich’s RSHA worked both on the outline plan for the Final Solution anda second draft of the Generalplan. A general statement on the outline of the Final Solution, to embrace not only the millions of Jews living in Poland and the Soviet Union but also the far smaller com- munities of Western Europe, was ready by December 1941.15 The meeting had to be postponed until January, but when the Secretaries of State met at Wannsee in January 1942, Heydrich’s proposal  racaivad na eriticiom Ru eantract tha cacand rach draft anf tha Canaralnlan Net uthich addraccad itealf nat ta tha Taurich minnrity hit ta tha far larcar nan_Taurich nanulatiane af Daland and tha Caviat  Page 463 of 800 57% Eastern territory that was expected to fall under German control.12 A few weeks earlier Himmler had requested additional funds to establish an independent construction administration of the SS. columns would begin the enormous construction programme called for by Meyer’s Generalplan.
