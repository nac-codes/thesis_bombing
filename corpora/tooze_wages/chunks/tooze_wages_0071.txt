Into the enormous space cleared by the Generalplan Ost, Himmler and his staff foresaw, over a period of twenty to thirty years, the settlement of at least 10 million Germans. The ethnic boundary of the German race was to be forced 1,000 kilometres to the east.24 The SS planners involved in these discussions were only too aware that by conjuring up images of the Teutonic knights they were in danger of appearing outlandishly archaic.
