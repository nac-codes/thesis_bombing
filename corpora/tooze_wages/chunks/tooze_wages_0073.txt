And the bloody conquest of the American West provided Ger- many with the historical warrant it needed to justify the clearance of the Slav population. ‘Here in the East a similar process will repeat itself for a second time as in the conquest of America.’ A ‘superior’ settler population would displace an ‘inferior’ native population opening the way towards a new era of economic possibility. ‘Europe-and not America-will be the land of unlimited possibilities.’22  The Generalplan Ost envisioned, not a return to the past, but a new and expansive phase of German economic development. It belongs in the company of the German Labour Front’s enormous housing programme announced in the autumn of 1940 and the pre-war Volkswagen scheme. In the East, a new abundance of natural resources would be combined with German know-how and capital to enable a dramatic increase in the standard of living. The most succinct expression of this ambition was population density. In the initial planning for Poland this was set at 100 people per square kilometre. Once the territory of the Soviet Union was incorporated into the Generalplan Ost, the target was reduced to 80 people per square kilometre. This target was significantly lower than the density in Germany in 1939, at 133 people per square kilometre. But it was higher than that prevailing in France at the time.28 Nor were the agronomists working for the SS under any illusion about the standard of living that could be expected in a society consisting entirely of peasant farmers. Instead, Meyer’s ideal was the population structure of Bavaria or Hanover, which in the 1930s sustained an uncluttered balance of agriculture, industry and services.22 The Generalplan projected an agricultural share in the workforce of no more than one-third, with a similar share employed in industry, crafts, commerce and public services.
