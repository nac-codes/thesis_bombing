nal Solution.22 As Himmler put it to a meeting of  ceaninr CC landare in tha crrmmar nf 10/49. Agriculture 35 21 populated rural areas of the Reich. In addition, the SS hoped to be able to attract 220,000 young couples starting life in agriculture and at least 2 million colonists from the urban areas of Germany.33 senior SS leaders in the summer of 1942: If we do not fill our camps with slaves-in this room I mean to say things very firmly and very clearly-with worker slaves, who will build our cities, our villages, our farms without regard to any losses, then even after years of war we will not have enough money to be able to equip the settlements in such a manner that real Germanic people can live there and take root in the first generation.4@ Planners such as Konrad Meyer and the SS building chief Hans Kammler expressed themselves in less drastic language, but their intent was no less clear.4! The total labour demands of the Generalplan Ost were estimated to be in the order of 400,000-800,000 for the first phase. At a minimum, the number of forced labourers was set at 175,000-—Jews, Poles and Soviet prisoners of war’.42 On average, Meyer estimated, employing slave labour would reduce the cost of construction by 40 per cent in cash terms. Half of this saving, however, would be offset by the cost of maintaining the workforce with food and clothing, a debit item that Meyer added almost as an afterthought. For the future of the SS concentration camp system, these figures had important implications.42 In the first half of 1941 the population of the camps numbered no more than 60,000. Clearly there needed to be a dramatic expansion. To provide for the needs of the Generalplan, the SS building staff on 27 September 1941 ordered the construction of two new camps, each to house 50,000 inmates. One was to be sited in the Lublin-Majdanek. The other was to be built at Birkenau, a hamlet adjacent to the existing concentration camp at Auschwitz.44 By the end of the year the SS
