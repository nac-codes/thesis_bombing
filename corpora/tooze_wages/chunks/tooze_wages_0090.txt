Not surprisingly, therefore, when Hitler gave the definitive order in early December 1940 to begin preparing for an attack on the Soviet Union, State Secretary Herbert Backe in the Agriculture Ministry re- acted with alacrity.  For Backe this was a moment of considerable personal significance. Ever since the 1920s he had been fixated on the conquest of Russian territory as the ultimate solution to the problems of the ‘people without space’ (Volk ohne Raum).48 Now the first requirement was that Germany’s Army in the East-numbering 3 million men and 600,000 horses -should be fed from the territory of the Soviet Union. As Backe well understood, however, the Ukraine was not the limitless granary of imperialist cliché. The Ukraine, in fact, produced only a small net surplus of grain for export outside the Soviet Union. This was due. on the one hand. to the hackwardness of Russian asronomv and on the other hand to the extraordinarilv ranid growth in the Soviet urban nonulation. Since 1928 Stalin had Ota LOO Soviet Union intent upon not one, but two programmes of mass murder.47 Whereas the Final Solution and the Generalplan Ost were secrets closely guarded by the SS, for fear, amongst other things, Soviet Union. This was due, on the one hand, to the backwardness of Russian agronomy and on the other hand to the extraordinarily rapid growth in the Soviet urban population. Since 1928 Stalin had stamped an urban civilization of 30 million inhabitants out of the ground. The food for this vast new urban proletariat came from the Ukraine. To conventional economic analysts in Berlin this implied that even if the Ukraine were successfully conquered, Germany could expect little immediate benefit.42 It would, after all, take years before productivity could be substantially increased. Herbert Backe, however, drew radically different conclusions. To enable the grain surplus of the Ukraine to be directed immediately towards German needs, it was necessary simply to cut the
