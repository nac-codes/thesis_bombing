However, Backe’s imprint on the discussion is unmistakable. 51 Backe himself put the figure for the ‘surplus population’ of the Soviet Union at between 20 and 30 million, and over the following months these numbers established themselves as a common reference point. In mid-June, a week before the invasion of the Soviet Union, Himmler addressed SS Gruppenfuehrer on the forthcoming ‘race war’ (Volkstumskampf). It would, he opined, be a fight to the death in the course of which ‘through military actions and the food problems 20 to 30 million Slavs and Jews will die’.52 In November, Goering boasted to Count Ciano, the Italian Foreign Minister, that the starvation of 20-30 million Soviet citizens was an essential element of Germany’s occupation policy. Following Backe’s thinking to the letter, the guidelines issued by the OKW for the management of agriculture in the occupied Eastern territories—the so-called ‘Green Book’-called for all of the industrial and urban centres of western Russia, including the wooded region between Moscow and Leningrad, to be cut off from their food sources.23 As a result, the German occupation authorities were instructed to prepare themselves for a human catastrophe on an unprecedented scale. ‘Many tens of millions of people in this area will become surplus to requirements and will die or will be forced to emigrate to  Siberia’>4 In case the occupying authorities should be moved to alleviate the situation, the guidelines reaffirmed the essential connection between mass starvation and the continuation of the German wrar affart: 3.)
