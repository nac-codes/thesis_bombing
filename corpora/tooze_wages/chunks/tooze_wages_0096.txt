The rate and were subject to the same limitations encountered by the rest of the Wehrmacht’s motorized transport in Russia. As a means of killing, asphyxiation by carbon monoxide was simply too slow. Whilst experiments began in Poland with more efficient stationary gassing facilities, execution by hand remained the favoured practice in the Soviet Union even in the second sweeps in 1942, which claimed the lives of at least another 360,000 Jews in the Ukraine and Belorussia. In Galicia, where it is estimated that as many as 500,000 Jews were killed in the course of the German occupation, shooting and gassing were combined, as Heydrich had intended, with ‘destruction through labour’ (Vernichtung durch Arbeit).5© The opportunity for the latter was provided by the construction of a major strategic highway necessary to secure the supply lines for Army Group South.
