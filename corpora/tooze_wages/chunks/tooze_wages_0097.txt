The German authorities seem to have imagined that millionfold starvation could be induced simply by requisitioning all available grain and ‘shutting off’ the cities. In practice, this vision of mass starvation as a result of systematic inaction turned out to be naive.22 The Soviet population did not wait to be starved. The only large groups that it proved possible to kill simply by not feeding them were recognizable minorities within the urban population and people confined in captivity: in other words, the urban Jewish population and Soviet prisoners of war.
