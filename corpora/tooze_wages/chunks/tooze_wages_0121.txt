Between April and August, currency in circulation had increased by 10.9 per cent, three and a half times faster than in the same period in 1940. At the same time sales of government debt to banks had declined in relative terms. Though the Reichsbank did not doubt the willingness of the population to accept a severe reduction in the civilian standard of living, there were signs of increasing resort to the black market. Amongst those with access to scarce commodities, such as farmers, craftsmen and small shopkeepers, barter trade was becoming the norm.4!
