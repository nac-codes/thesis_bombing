nt and then, as of January 1942, to 55 per cent. Revenue from this source rose by 1.5 billion Reichsmarks in 1941-2 and by a further 1.8 billion Reichsmarks in 1942-3.46 More important was the mortgaging of future revenues from the Hauszinssteuer, a measure first proposed by the Reich Finance Ministry in December 1941. As we have seen, this tax had been introduced by the Weimar Republic in the 1920s to finance public housing construction. It generally brought in about 850 million Reichsmarks per annum. To combat the wartime fiscal emergency, the Finance Ministry originally proposed a prepayment of four years’ Axis shipping. As the Wehrmacht’s military-economic office concluded: ‘It follows from this that we simply cannot wage war simultaneously with all three branches of the Wehrmacht.’38 Over the following months the Reich authorities made a determined effort to restore Germany’s fiscal balance. As has often been remarked,44 the Third Reich did not resort to a major increase in cent. Revenue from this source rose by 1.5 billion Reichsmarks in 1941-2 and by a further 1.8 billion Reichsmarks in 1942-3.48 More important was the mortgaging of future revenues from the worth of tax. But on the insistence of the Prussian Finance Ministry and others this was raised to a one-off prepayment of ten years of tax.42 At least 4.5 billion Reichsmarks came out of liquid bank accounts and cash reserves of property owners; the rest was raised in the form of new mortgages. In total in 1942, this one-off measure brought in 8 billion Reichsmarks. Together with an increase in contributions from the occupied territories, it was enough to raise the share of Reich expenditure covered by tax revenues in 1942 to more than 54 per cent, despite a sharp increase in spending. The inflationary spiral was halted, at least for the time being. Not surprisingly, however, it was the suggestion of a major cut in armaments prices that caused the most furore. Since the rationalization drive following the
