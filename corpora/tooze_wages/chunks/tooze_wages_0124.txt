was halted, at least for the time being. Not surprisingly, however, it was the suggestion of a major cut in armaments prices that caused the most furore. Since the rationalization drive following the Sudeten crisis in the autumn of 1938, the pricing of public contracts had been regulated by the so-called LSOe system. Though this was far from optimal it was not, as has sometimes been suggested, a licence for gross inefficiency.48 Under the LSOe, prices were set on the basis of estimated costs, plus a rate of profit, normally 5 per cent, calculated not as a percentage of these costs, but on the capital employed.

Revenue from this source rose by 1.5 billion Reichsmarks in 1941-2 and by a further 1.8 billion Reichsmarks in 1942-3.46 More important was the mortgaging of future revenues from the worth of tax. But on the insistence of the Prussian Finance Ministry and others this was raised to a one-off prepayment of ten years of tax.4Z At least 4.5 billion Reichsmarks came out of liquid bank fixed and if unit costs fell below the estimate, the profit, at least initially, accrued to the producers. There was, therefore, a clear incentive for cost-cutting and efficiency. And the evidence suggests that armaments contractors took advantage. Despite the
