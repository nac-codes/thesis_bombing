as a result of an unrelated intrigue by the SS.5° But the incident is nevertheless indicative of the tensions building up within the German war economy. In the autumn of 1941, even the German Grossraum faced an overall coal deficit of roughly 40 million tons. This reflected both the lagging production of the pits and the ever-increasing demands of German industry.56 As a result, the threat that this might soon be increased to 25 per cent.58 Even the producers of electricity and gas could no longer be exempt. Cutting the coal allocated to households was not an option, since to ensure the continuity of industrial supplies in the first half of 1941, inadequate preparations had been made for laying in the necessary household stocks for the coming winter.52 Unless a serious effort was made over the coming months to ensure adequate stockpiling there would be a public relations disaster on the home front. To make room for these essential transports, there was even talk of a drastic 40 per cent reduction in the supply to all non-essential industrial customers. As Hanneken put it to Thomas of the OKW: ‘The moment has come at which the Fuehrer himself must decide what should be done in the raw material field over the winter.’£2 The shortages were such as to render absurd the gigantic chemicals expansion schemes that Krauch had set out only a few weeks earlier. To provide the raw materials and power for Krauch’s fuel hydrogenation and Buna targets, Germany’s coal production would have had to have been raised by a further 30 million tons, on top of the existing deficit of 35-40 million tons.£1 In the end it was not Hitler but Keitel of Wehrmacht high command who intervened. At a series of meetings between 14 and 16 August 1941, he attempted to force the three branches of the Wehr- macht to tailor their armaments programmes to fit the constraints imposed by the coal shortage. Instead of monthly steel production of 2 million tons Germany would have to make do with only 1.65 mill
