This reflected both the lagging production of the pits and the ever-increasing demands of German industry.2£ As a result, the occupied territories were being supplied at a rate of only 60 per cent of requirement. Within Germany, the steel industry was having its coal consumption throttled by 15 per cent and there was the be done in the raw material field over the winter’£2 The shortages were such as to render absurd the gigantic chemicals expansion schemes that Krauch had set out only a few weeks earlier.
