12 August, as Roosevelt and Churchill met in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland, Hitler could hardly have been more explicit. To the Spanish ambassador he declared: ‘The main guilty parties in this war... are the Americans, Roosevelt with his commit itself against the West, it was the cause of relief, bordering on euphoria in Berlin.8? Finally, Hitler and Ribbentrop had the chance to complete the global strategic alliance they had been hoping not to seek a separate peace.
