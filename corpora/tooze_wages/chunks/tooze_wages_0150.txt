Within weeks, Japan had dealt a shattering blow to the British Empire. For the foreseeable future, the Western powers would be spread across the entire globe. For Hitler, meanwhile, the chief priority continued to be the Soviet Union. As he had done since the summer of 1940, he continued to regard the successful elimination of the Soviet Union as the essential precondition for a global war against Britain and America. Well into the early summer of 1942 Hitler speculated that the blows inflicted by the Japanese, combined with fresh German successes against the Red Army, would be enough to split asunder the unnatural alliance between Britain and America. As events in Asia were demonstrating only too clearly, Britain was in imminent danger of losing its Empire. Only America stood to profit from continuing the struggle.
