Declining output! He thinks of the necessity to make peace!’101 Six weeks later, when it seemed as though the Soviet counter-offensive might rip the heart out of the German line, Fromm seriously considered stripping all of the home army training units of their expert instructors so as to be able to provide a final draft of fifteen first-class infantry divisions.192 This would have helped to restore the situation of Army Group Centre, but it would also have halted the training of any new recruits. Fromm, therefore, decided to hold off until ‘Germany’s final moment of peril’ (Deutschlands letzte Not). But the fact that Fromm was considering such extremities is indicative.
