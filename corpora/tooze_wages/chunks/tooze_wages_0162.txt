At the very least, the possibility that Germany might be working on a similar device required insurance, a kind of strategic calculation, which the Third Reich was never able to afford. IV  The narrative segues in this and the previous chapters-from Germany’s genocidal imperialism, via the defeat of Army Group Centre, to the atomic bomb-may at first seem bewildering. But they reflect the shocking ‘contemporaneity of the uncontemporaneous’ (Gleichzeitigkeit des Ungleichzeitigen) which characterizes this crucial turning point in world history. The point is not that Germany’s imperialism in Eastern Europe represented a regression into atavistic barbarism. The Nazi programme of genocide was certainly barbaric. But, as we have seen, it was tied to an ambitious project of colonial settlement and violent modernization. The point is not that Nazi racism was atavistic. The point is that it was anachronistic.

In January 1942, he fol- lowed Udet’s example and shot himself.104 To cover up the embarrassment, a state funeral was hastily arranged, attended by all the dignitaries of German industry. tiny tanks dwarfed embarrassingly by their Soviet counterparts, the bedraggled army of horses and Panje wagons, the primitive brutality of the Einsatzgruppen, the fumbling attempts to construct asphyxiation chambers—all appear grotesquely crude, by comparison with the cutting-edge physics and high-tech engineering that were opening the door to the nuclear era in the deserts of New Mexico. Barbarossa was a belated and perverse outgrowth of a European tradition of colonial conquest and settlement, a tradition that was not yet fully aware of its own obsolescence. The ignorant condescension shown by all sides, not just by th
