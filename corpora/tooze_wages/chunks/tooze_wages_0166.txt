ehrmacht had already reached the bottom of the manpower barrel at the time of Barbarossa. By the autumn of 1941 there were virtually no men in their twenties who had not already been conscripted. Fresh cohorts of teenagers provided the Wehrmacht with less than a million fresh recruits in 1942, enough only to replace the losses inflicted by the Red Army. To achieve any kind of expansion, the recruiters needed to draw on middle-aged German men previously exempted from the draft, including large numbers of armaments workers. In the first half of 1942 the Wehrmacht draft included at least 200,000 men taken from the armaments factories.2 At a time when Germany desperately needed to increase its armaments output, this was a disaster.2 Figure 19.
