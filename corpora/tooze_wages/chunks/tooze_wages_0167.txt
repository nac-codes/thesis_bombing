It has become a commonplace to compare the mobilization of Germany’s female labour force in World War II unfavourably to that of Britain. This, however, ignores the obvious. As we have seen, German women in 1939 were already more actively engaged in the labour force than Britain’s women were to be even at the end of the war. When the chief statistician of the Reich Labour Ministry investigated the issue in the autumn of 1943, using data that were very unfavourable to Germany, he arrived at the conclusion that the share of women in war work was 25.4 per cent in the United States, 33.1 per cent in Britain and 34 per cent in Germany.4 Another comparative study in the spring of 1944 arrived at the same conclusion. Though British regulations appeared to conscript a wider age range, Germany’s level of mobilization actually exceeded that of Britain.2 The expert administrators also rejected any unfavourable comparisons with World War I. At the height of the battles at Verdun and on the Somme, German women’s labour market participation rate had been 45.3 per cent, somewhat less than the participation rate of their daughters twenty-five years later. Of course, even more might have been squeezed out of the German female population.
