for labour claimed that even with the ‘powers of Stalin’ he would be able to mobilize no more than 1 million additional women.7 And Hans Kehrl, one of the most draconian advocates of total mobilization, never hoped for more than 700,000 additional female workers.® These are not the kind of figures which could have made much of a counterpoint to Hitler’s choice to replace Fritz Todt with Albert Speer a few weeks earlier. Whereas the new Armaments Minister was the handsome, urbane technocrat, Gauleiter Sauckel was a stocky, moustached representative of the populist, ‘socialist’ wing of the Nazi party, the very archetype of the deracinated petty bourgeois.2 In the sound recordings of the Nuremberg trial one can still hear the distinctive traces of Sauckel’s plebeian origins in his heavy Franconian accent and stilted delivery.

After an early period of adventure as a merchant sailor in the Scandinavian trade, Sauckel returned to Germany from French captivity in 1919 determined to resume his education.
