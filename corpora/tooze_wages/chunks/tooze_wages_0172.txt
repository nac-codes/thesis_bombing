rs old.12 They were drawn from the occupied territory of the Soviet Union—the Baltic Republics, Belorussia, the Ukraine and to a lesser extent from Russia itself. Poland was Sauckel’s most intensive area of recruit- ment. But he also plied his brutal trade in the Czech Protectorate, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy. Between January 1942 and the end of June 1943 the GBA delivered 2.8 million new foreign This was frustrating, but in 1944 the Reich plenipotentiary for labour claimed that even with the ‘powers of Stalin’ he would be able to mobilize no more than 1 million additional women.2 And Hans Kehr, one of the most draconian advocates of total mobilization, never hoped for more than 700,000 additional female workers.8 These are not the kind of figures which could have made much of a workers to Germany: the workforce of a great factory—34,000-strong—every week, for seventy-eight weeks. By the summer of 1943 the total foreign workforce had increased to 6.5 million, of whom 4.95 million were civilians rather than prisoners of war. After the summer of 1943 the pace slowed somewhat, but Sauckel continued to bring in workers. By February 1944 the total of foreign civilians and prisoners of war had risen to 7.356 million. By the autumn of 1944 it had reached a maximum of 7.907 million. At this point, foreign workers accounted for more than 20 per cent of the German workforce. Of the armaments workers of the Third Reich, more than a third were foreign. In the plants of the Reichswerke Hermann Goering and the Luftwaffe, the foreign share routinely exceeded 40 per cent.13 On individual production lines the percentage could be even higher. As State Secretary Milch boasted in June 1943, the Stuka Ju 87 was being ‘80 per cent manufactured by Russians’14  Since the Nuremberg tribunal introduced the term ‘slave labour’ into the discussion, Sauckel and his programme have been variously described as ‘millennial’ and ‘Pharaonic’.15 Such terms certainly capture the increas
