Total Lager centration camp, in the suburban town of Allach.21 In approaching this huge phenomenon of forced migration one should not forget that supposedly liberal societies throughout the last century and a half have often responded in a paradoxical fashion  Page 516 of 800 63% een — Dae are “eet “tr Aa, — eta a rt, — etc “al, — eee to the migration flows unleashed by rapid economic change. To this day, virtually all the rich countries in the world pursue profoundly contradictory immigration regimes and their politicians struggle to give anything resembling rational leadership on issues of migration, asylum and race relations.

Furthermore, we know that from its very inception in the spring of 1940 the foreign labour programme had been cross-cut by savage lines of racial discrimination. This continued after 1942, even when foreign labour procurement was atop priority. The result was a series of ghastly contradictions. On the one hand, Gauleiter Sauckel made strenuous efforts to mobilize millions of workers for employment in the Reich. At the same time, the SS and the Wehrmacht were deliberately murdering millions of people, who could just as well have served as workers for the German war economy.
