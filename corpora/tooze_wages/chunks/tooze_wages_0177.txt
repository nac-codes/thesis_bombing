And yet, as early as November 1941, given the impasse on the Eastern Front, Hitler had taken the decision that Soviet prisoners of war were to be employed, not only in the rear areas, but in Germany itself.22 Hundreds of thousands of men were shipped to Germany over the following months, but the mistreatment continued, resulting ment. But he also phed his brutal trade in the Czech Protectorate, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy. Between January 1942 and the end of June 1943 the GBA delivered 2.8 million new foreign in mass deaths in prisoner of war camps in Germany itself, and a continuing wastage of labour power.23 Even before Sauckel was appointed, the OKW’s military-economic office and the Reich Group for industry had complained to the Food Ministry that it was simply pointless to import hundreds of thousands of workers only for them to succumb to malnutrition.24 In early March the Mittel-deutsche Motorenwerke, a contractor for the Air Ministry, felt forced to spell out the difference between employing Eastern workers as construction labourers and employing them in the manufacture of aero- engines: ‘If in the case of road building in the East we employ 2,000 Russians, and as a result of inadequate food supplies we lose a few hundred Russians per quarter, the missing labourers can simply be replaced by new Russians.’ By contrast, ‘In the manufacturing processes of an armaments plant it is simply not possible suddenly to exchange a man, who has been operating a special piece of ma- chinery, with another worker.25 centration camp, in the suburban town of Allach.22 chinery, with another worker.’25 In a somewhat less extreme form, the same paradoxical treatment was also meted out to the civilian Ostarbeiter recruited to Germany in ever-increasing numbers in 1942. In part this was attributable to the sheer s
