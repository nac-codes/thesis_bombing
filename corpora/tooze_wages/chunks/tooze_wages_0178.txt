t less extreme form, the same paradoxical treatment was also meted out to the civilian Ostarbeiter recruited to Germany in ever-increasing numbers in 1942. In part this was attributable to the sheer success of Sauckel’s recruitment drive, which overwhelmed Germany’s local authorities. In the summer of 1942 literally thousands of new workers were arriving in the major industrial centres every day. It was impossible to organize either adequate housing or rations. Conditions varied between cities and between employers, but in many cases, perhaps particularly in heavy industrial areas, the situation was awful. In December 1942 a commission of inquiry by the Ostministerium and Wistab Ost visited Ostarbeiterlager across the Ruhr and reported in shocked tones. As just one example, they singled out the camp operated by the Bochumer Verein, a member of the Vestag trust, where they witnessed a ‘picture of desolation and immiseration’ which would ‘never be extinguished’.26 Coming from ‘unsentimental’ bureaucrats with ample experience of the East, these were strong words. And they were confirmed by the behaviour of Ostarbeiter themselves. For generations, the Anglo-A -American public has been regaled with stories of daring escapes by British and American airmen and soldiers.

However, from 1942 onwards they were vastly outnumbered by absconding Soviet prisoners of war and Ostarbeiter. Between April and July 1942 the number of Soviet absconders increased from 2,059 to 22,603. In August 1942 the Gestapo estimated that it would have to deal with a further 30,000 escapes in the coming months. Of the 42,714 foreign workers who were reported as having absconded between April and July 1942, the Gestapo claimed to have recaptured 34,457
