deal with a further 30,000 escapes in the coming months. Of the 42,714 foreign workers who were reported as having absconded between April and July 1942, the Gestapo claimed to have recaptured 34,457.22 But given these numbers it was clearly impractical to continue with conventional police methods. In September 1942 the chief of the Gestapo himself, SS Gruppenfuehrer Heinrich Mueller, took personal charge of the effort to control the population of Eastern workers. Instead of pursuing tens of thousands of individual cases, he instituted a new and comprehensive sys- tem of police cordons on all major roads, railway stations and in town centres across the country.28 By the autumn of 1942, given the conditions in the camps, tens of thousands of half-dead Ostarbeiter had to be shipped back eastwards under nightmarish conditions. In September one transport was described in apocalyptic terms: ‘There were dead passengers on the returning train. Women on that train gave birth to children that were tossed from the open window during the journey, while people sick with tuberculosis and venereal disease rode in the same coach. The dying lay in freight cars without straw, and one of the dead was . . . thrown onto the embankment.’22 Obviously, this account is suffused with a sense of biblical exaggeration. However, a number of reports confirm the claim that the emaciated corpses of Ostarbeiter were dumped on German railway embankments,22 not to mention the fact that trainloads of Eastern workers were routinely abandoned in railway yards for hours on end, in full view of regular German passengers, without any form of sanitation. By word of mouth and through letters home, rumours soon spread about the treatment that Ostarbeiter could expect in Germany. Not surprisingly, by September 1942 the managers of foreign labour camps in the Ukraine were reporting ‘Transportangstpsychosen’. By the end of the summer, the flow of voluntary recruits had come to a complete halt, which in turn pr
