By the end of the summer, the flow of voluntary recruits had come to a complete halt, which in turn precipitated an extreme escal- ation of violence on the part of Sauckel’s recruiting agents.31  Horrific as all of this clearly was, it pales by comparison with the even more shocking contradiction engendered by Germany’s expanding campaign of Judaeocide. The manpower crisis unleashed by the defeat at Moscow was followed within months by the murderous peak of the Holocaust in the second half of 1942.

Hundreds of thousands were shot or worked to death, or died of starvation and disease in the ghettos. But the main means of killing the bulk of the Jewish population of Poland were three dedicated killing centres, Treblinka, Sobibor and Chelmno, as well as the gas chamber complex at the concentration camp at Auschwitz. Whilst the first three were shut down in 1943, Auschwitz continued, to become the final destination for hundreds of thousands of Jews from across Western Europe in 1942 and 1943 and Hungary in 1944. Even assuming that the Jews were to be used only for the most menial forms of work the Holocaust involved a catastrophic destruction of labour power. Applying the Germans’ own conservative standards, the Holocaust must have claimed the lives of at l
