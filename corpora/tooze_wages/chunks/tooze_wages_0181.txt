for the most menial forms of work the Holocaust involved a catastrophic destruction of labour power. Applying the Germans’ own conservative standards, the Holocaust must have claimed the lives of at least 2.4 million potential workers. Adding this to Nazism’s other acts of mass murder after January 1942, we arrive at an astonishing total. Of the 1.65 million inmates of concentration camps employed at one time or another in the German economy—referring here to camps not involved in the extermination phase of the Final Solution— no more than 475,000 survived the war.32 This implies the death of at least 1.1 million workers, at least 800,000 of whom do not also number amongst the victims of the Holocaust. Of the 1.95 million Soviet prisoners of war who are thought to have been employed in Germany after November 1941, less than half survived the war. As many as a million Soviet prisoners may, therefore, have died after they were designated as potential contributors to the German war effort. This is in addition to the 2 million who had starved to death over the winter of 1941—2.

This is almost certainly an underestimate, since it takes no account of the number of ‘worn-out’ workers repatriated to an uncertain fate in the Eastern territories. Most ominously, it neglects the gap in the German statistics between those who were deported from the Eastern territories and those who were regis
