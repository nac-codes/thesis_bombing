cession to ideology, made possible by Sauckel’s success in recruiting non-Jewish labour from all over Europe. Jewish workers could be dispensed with, since there always appeared to be other workers to replace them. In fact, however, despite the rhetoric espoused by Himmler, the SS were not oblivious to economic concerns in their killing of the Jewish population. The practice of ‘Selektion’ was a ubiquitous first step in virtually every massacre.38 The population was divided into those incapable and those capable of work. This meant that once initial inhibitions were overcome, it was women, children and old people that tended to be killed first, particularly in 1942, the high point of the Judaeocide. In dealing with the large Jewish communities of the Ukraine or Galicia, the SS returned on several occasions to the same location or township, progressively reducing the Jewish population to an ‘indispensable core’. In many cases this productive remnant was then transported to a central ghetto location for further exploitation, before the ghetto itself was finally liquidated in 1943 or even as late as 1944. In Poland, the practice was first applied at the end of 1941, in the so-called Warthegau, one of the provinces newly annexed to Germany. Those judged incapable of work in the Warthegau were amongst the first to be killed by gassing at the experimental facility at Chelmno. Those that were still capable of exploitation were concentrated in the Lédz (Litzmannstadt) ghetto, which continued as a centre of war production until early 1944. This established a template which was applied  Page 521 of 800 64% Oe ge, ee ee ee ee ee Of the 1.65 million inmates of concentration camps employed at one time or another in the German economy—treferring here to camps not involved in the extermination phase of the Final Solution— no more than 475,000 survived the war.22 This implies the death of at least 1.1 million workers, at least 800,000 of whom do not also number amongst the victims
