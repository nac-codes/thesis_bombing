10,000 prisoners of other nationalities. In total, 400,000 people were at one time or other registered as inmates in the records of the Auschwitz Stammlager, half of them Jewish. Conditions, particularly for the Jews, were appalling, so that the majority of these inmates died in a matter of months. In addition, tens of thousands of inmates were shuffled around the concentration camp system, as needs dictated. Auschwitz itself reached its maximum strength in the autumn of 1943, when the camp complex contained 90,000 inmates. At any one time, between 50 and 60 per cent of these were judged fit enough for work. This workforce was never employed on the far-flung building sites of the Generalplan, as had been the intention when the camp was expanded in 1941. But the majority of work done by the inmates was nevertheless connected in one way or another to the programme of Germanization in the East, starting at Auschwitz itself. The camp’s inmates helped to construct IG Farben’s prestige chemicals facility at Ausch- witz-Monowitz, as well as many other industrial facilities dotted around eastern Silesia.44 They were thus laying the foundations for a Silesian industrial complex to rival the Ruhr. But the majority of Page 523 of 800 64% oauckel's success 1n recruiting millions of workers from across Eastern and Western Lurope made the jews appear dispensable. =~ Only in Foland and the Ukraine did the jews account for more than a scale can now be realized. I shall set to at once on a large scale... "41 the inmates worked on the camp itself, which was no less a bastion of German settlement in the East than the much larger industrial facilities that sprang up around it. By 1942 the SS architects had drawn up plans for a permanent slave labour complex at Auschwitz-Birkenau counting no less than 600 buildings. More than 300 of these were completed by the end of the war. In addition, thousands of inmates worked on the 4,000-hectare estate that Himmler had carved out of the surroun
