2 Such procedures, however, were long-winded and often meant that the employer ‘lost’ the worker concerned.21 In many cases it clearly seemed more efficient to settle the matter there and then in the workplace. After all, casual physical violence was by no means unknown in Ger- man industry and this was particularly the case in coal mining, where questions concerning the proper employment of Ostarbeiter were at their most acute. As we have seen, the shortage of coal and coal miners was a central preoccupation of the German war effort from the spring of 1941 onwards. Providing miners for Paul Pleiger’s hard-pressed pits was amongst Sauckel’s top priorities.52 But unless these workers could be fed and disciplined they would be useless to the German war effort. As a result, Pleiger supported Sauckel in pleading for increased food allocations. Without extra calor- ies, protein and fat, Pleiger simply could not get the coal so desperately needed by German heavy industry.22 At the same time, however, Pleiger also advocated the systematic use of coercive force.

Providing miners for Paul Pleiger’s hard-pressed pits was amongst Sauckel’s top priorities.22 But early October 1942 Pleiger, together with Robert Ley of the DAF, chaired a working meeting of mine managers from the Ruhr in the luxurious surroundings of the Kaiserhof hotel in Essen. As head of the DAF, Ley was jointly responsible with Sauckel for overseeing the foreign workforce. The key item on the agenda of the Kaiserhof session was the question of ‘how to treat the Russians’.24 A remark- able verbatim report of the meeting kept by a Krupp manager gives a startling insight, not only into the brutal practices of the f
