session was the question of ‘how to treat the Russians’.24 A remark- able verbatim report of the meeting kept by a Krupp manager gives a startling insight, not only into the brutal practices of the foreign labour programme. It also reveals the terrifying fears that crowded in upon the leaders of German industry, whenever they paused to contemplate the wider situation of the Third Reich. Robert Ley, as usual, was drunk. And when Ley was drunk he was prone to speaking his mind: ‘The coal must be got, whatever happens. If not with you, gentlemen, then against you.’ If the Ruhr failed, so would the entire armaments effort and in the autumn of Stalingrad that would spell disaster. ‘After us there is nothing, everything will be over . .. Germany will be destroyed. Everybody will be slaughtered, murdered, burned and destroyed. We have, after all, burned all bridges behind us, deliberately, we have. We have practically solved the Jewish question in Germany. That alone is something so awesome.’ With so much at stake there was no room for compassion or civility. No degree of coercion was too much and Ley expected the mine managers to back up their foremen in meting out the necessary discipline. As Ley put it: ‘When a Russian pig has to be beaten’, it would be the ordinary German worker who would have to do it. ‘You won't be doing it and I won't.’ To make sure the mine managers got the message, Pleiger added with characteristic cynicism: ‘Below ground it is dark and Berlin is a long way away.’ Clearly, Ley and Pleiger expected Germany’s coal miners to ignore Sauckel’s sanctimonious injunctions. If Ostarbeiter did not work, they were to be beaten. But if employers did prefer a more formal mode of discipline, Heinrich Himmler’s police could always be counted upon. Pleiger referred enthusiastically to the results achieved by the ‘small but perfectly formed concentration camp’ that he used to discipline his workforce at the Reichswerke.2> At wvanionle: tha aaman ten ne tha Vaiaas
