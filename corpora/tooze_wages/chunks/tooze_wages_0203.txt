SS supervisors carried out regular for employers to make at least some effort to stabilize their inmate labour force. At Auschwitz, IG Farben negotiated with the SS to provide food supplements as premiums.®¢ On the other hand, when punishment was necessary, IG’s site management made clear that they preferred beatings to take place behind the barbed wire of the concentration camp.&2 They did not question the SS’s right to treat Who exactly benefited most from the employment of concentration camp labour, the most barbarous aspect of Germany’s foreign labour programme, is a matter of some contention.®2 It is clear that in industrial manufacturing the balance between the costs of inmate labour, as specified by the ‘fees’ paid to the SS, and the productivity of average inmate workers was very favourable to the employer. In construction, where the majority of inmate labour was consumed, the balance was less good. Here everything depended on the rate at which the workforce was replenished with new inmates. Per- versely, in low-skilled occupations, employers actually had an incentive to accelerate the rate of Selektion. Whether or not these arrangements were more or less favourable than employing German workers depended on the precise balance between the relative productivity of the inmates, the fees paid to the SS, the additional overheads involved in employing inmate labour and the price for the job granted by the official procurement agency. This last variable is the true unknown in the economics of forced labour, both for concentration camp inmates and other categories of workers.Z° For the vast majority of firms who were allocated foreign labour and, in particular, concentration camp labour, the Reich was not only the supplier of labour. It was also the ultimate customer. Public procurement officials had no interest in leaving their contractors with ‘unnecessary’ profits that had been earned by employing cheap labour supplied at the expense of the Reich. But the comple
