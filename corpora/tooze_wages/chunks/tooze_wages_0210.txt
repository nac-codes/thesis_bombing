began in June 1941, elerated into 1942 and reached its completion, except for the Hungarian Jewry, by the end of 1943. In 1942 the simultaneous intensification of foreign labour recruitment and the unresolved tension between ideology and pragmatism resulted in chaos and murderous confusion in the prisoner of war and Ostarbeiter camps. But by 1943 the most counterproductive mistreatment of the Ostarbeiter had run its course. Those that survived were put to work with increasing effectiveness. Mortality, especially amongst Soviet prisoners, continued to be high. However, for civilian Ostarbeiter the statistics suggest that by the autumn of 1943 the situation was broadly speaking ‘under control’. In July and August 1943, two months for which we have precise statistics, there were ‘only’ 2,300 deaths out of a total population of 1.6 million civilian Ostarbeiter in Germany.“ This was twice the rate of mortality in the German population and a third higher than would have been expected amongst a similar group in the Soviet Union in the 1930s. But this category of foreign workers was certainly no longer suffering ‘mass attrition’. Sauckel, as GBA, the employers and the SS had ved at a compromise, whick ed the essential demands of all sides. Ultimately, it is productivity that must serve as the yardstick of the forced labour programme. In this regard the evidence clearly supports the story of adjustment and compromise just described. The unsatisfactory conditions prevailing in the first chaotic phase of the Ostarbeiter programme were well illustrated by the situation at Krupp’s home plant, the Gusstahlfabrik at Essen, in the autumn of 1942.73 In the space of only a few months in the summer of that year, Krupp became a gigantic employer of foreign labour.
