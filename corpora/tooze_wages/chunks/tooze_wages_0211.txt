The unsatisfactory conditions prevailing in the first chaotic phase of the Ostarbeiter programme were well illustrated by the situation at Krupp’s home plant, the Gusstahlfa sen, inthe autumn stood at only 2,861, increased in a single year by more than nine times. By the end of the year, almost 25,000 foreign workers were employed in the Essen steelworks. Not surprisingly, management had difficulty in coping with this extraordinary transformation in their workforce and the immediate impact on productivity was severe.
