oup with such awful thoroughness. The assumption of a racial struggle was an unalterable given in the Nazi worldview. On the other hand, it is also clear that, as the war ground on, sustaining the war effort increasingly came to override every other preoccupation of Hitler’s regime. The result was a certain segmentation of policy, in which the SS was permitted to pursue the ideological imperative of exterminating the Jewish population. At the same time the treatment of the foreign labour force, the concentration camp population and at least a small remnant of the Jewish population was progressively ‘economized’ to take account of the needs of the war economy. This is a powerful interpretative framework, as far as it goes. Its key weakness, however, is the fact that it considers only two contradictory imperatives: the ideological imperative for mass murder and the productive requirement for more labour. By reducing the ‘economic imperative’ to the question of labour, what is obscured is the no less important question of food. We are thus led to ignore what in 1941 had been an independent and powerful ‘economic’ imperative for mass murder.Z6  Let us remind ourselves: in the first weeks of 1941. the Reich Ministrv of Food and the Wehrmacht militarv-economic staff had agreed on the Hunger Plan. a scheme which called for the deliberate  precise statistics, there were ‘only’ 2,300 deaths out of a total population of 1.6 million civilian Ostarbeiter in Germany.Z2 This was twice the rate of mortality in the German population and a third been an independent and powerful ‘economic’ imperative for mass murder.Z& Let us remind ourselves: in the first weeks of 1941, the Reich Ministry of Food and the Wehrmacht military-economic staff had agreed on the Hunger Plan, a scheme which called for the deliberate starvation of no less than 30 million inhabitants of the Soviet Union. This explicit commitment to mass murder was made official policy, months before the SS began to formulate
