This explicit commitment to mass murder was made official policy, months before the SS began to formulate a concrete and specific plan for the extermination of the Jewish population of Europe. Food cut across the contradiction between economics and ideology, between the need for labour and the imperative for genocide. It provided the Third Reich with a starkly economic incentive for murder on a scale larger even than the Holocaust. Furthermore, the problem of food supply was at the heart of the entire crisis of the  fanraion lahaur nracramme in 1949 Tt urae far urant af fand that the Saviat nricanare nf urar the cancantratian camn inmatac and tha athar Actarhoiter diad in euch dreadfil niwmhare aven after thay group of foreign workers, French civilians, underperformed their German counterparts by between 15 and 30 per cent.
