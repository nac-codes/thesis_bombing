contradictions that appear to characterize Nazi policy, above allin 1942, resolve themselves into a ghastly pattern of coherence. The military crisis of the winter of 1941—2 frustrated Herbert Backe’s immediate aim of bringing about a massive rearrangement of the food balance in the Eastern territories. But at the same time it confirmed his deepest anxiety. Backe had not been bluffing in 1941. In light of the extension of the war into the indefinite future, Germany was facing a severe food problem.28 The German grain harvest in both 1940 and 1941 had been well below average and imports from the occupied territories had not made up the difference.72 For lack of feed the swine herd had been reduced by 25 per cent since the start of the war, triggering a cut in meat rations as of June 1941.80 Bread rations had only been sustained by making severe inroads into grain stocks. By the end of 1941, these were nearing exhaustion. When the order to ship large numbers of Eastern workers to Germany for work was first given by Goering in November 1941, Backe protested vigorously.81 The 400,000 Soviet prisoners of war already in Germany were more than he could provide for. Goering had spoken casually of feeding the Eastern workers on cats and horse-meat.82 Backe had consulted the statistics and reported glumly that there were not enough cats to provide a ration for the Eastern workers and horse-meat was already being used to supplement the rations of the German population.83 If the Rus- sians were to be given meat, they would have to be supplied at the expense of the German population. The official ration that was settled on for Soviet prisoners and Ostarbeiter in December 1941 was clearly inadequate for men intended for hard labour. It consisted of a weekly allocation of 16.5 kilos of turnips, 2.6 kilos of ‘bread’ (made up of 65 per cent red rye, 25 per cent sugar beet waste and 10 ner cent straw or leaves). 3 kilos of notatoes. 250 srams of horse- ar ather scran meat. 130 srams
