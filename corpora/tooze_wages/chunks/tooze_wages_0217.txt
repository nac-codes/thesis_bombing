The appalling quality of the bread caused serious damage to the digestive tract and resulted in chronic malnutrition. The vegetables had to be cooked for hours before they were palatable, robbing them of most of their nutritional content. Though this was a diet that was, relatively speaking, high in carbohydrates, providing a nominal daily total of 2,500 calories, it was grossly deficient in the fat and protein necessary to sustain hard physical labour. It was certainly not enough to restore half-starved Soviet prisoners to good health. To make matters worse, in the vast majority of camps nothing like this official ration was ever delivered to the inmates.  The Wehrmacht, which had been Backe’s co-author of the Hunger Plan, drew radical conclusions. Only days after Sauckel’s appointment, at a time when the GBA was still drawing up his plans for mass recruitment, the Wehrmacht’s military-economic office spelled out to him the basic equation between calories and labour power:  The concepts of normal labour, heavy labour and extra heavy labour have to be regarded in objective terms, independent of racial consideration, as a through-put of calories and muscular effort.
