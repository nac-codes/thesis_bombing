eat rations as of June 1941.89 Bread rations had only been sustained by making severe inroads into grain stocks. By the end of 1941, these were first order, which Backe would never have suggested if the situation had not absolutely required it. The Wehrmacht had prepared the way in 1942, by decreeing a ration cut for the fighting troops. When the reduction in the civilian ration was announced it produced a response which justified every anxiety on the part of the Nazi leadership. On 23 March 1942 the SD reported that news of the impending cut was causing extreme disquiet amongst German civilians. It was, reported the SD’s informants, ‘devastating’ like ‘virtually no other event during the war’.86 Studies by nutritional experts added to the leadership’s concerns. The reduced ration prevailing since the start of the war had had a serious impact on the population’s reserves of body fat. The tendency of factory workers doing heavy manual labour to gain weight in middle age had been completely negated. This was cause for alarm, because the fat reserves in the bodies of the labour force had acted as a buffer in the first years of the war. It was now to be expected that any further reduction in the ration would result in a precipitate decline in performance, particularly in industries such as mining.82 Against this backdrop, there was no hope of pushing through any improvement in the rations for Sauckel’s newly arrived Ostarbeiter. It was true, of course, that the most disadvantaged Ostarbeiter and Soviet prisoners numbered altogether just over a million in the spring of 1942 and that a substantial improvement in their rations would have required only a very modest further cut in the food supplied to the German population. But given the mood both in the Food Ministry and in the population at large, any such redistribution was out of the question. The public demanded that if the German ration was to be reduced, the foreign workers should fare even worse. Backe resvonded to
