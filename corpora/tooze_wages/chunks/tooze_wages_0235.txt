per cent of its meat.104 Most of these provisions never crossed the German border. The food went directly to the Wehrmacht. Of those deliveries that did enter the Reich, the General Government supplied an astonishing 51 per cent of German rye imports, 66 per cent of oats and 52 per cent of German potato imports. This was directly at the expense of the local population. Thanks to a remarkably good harvest in the General Government, rations were not cut off completely as Frank had anticipated in August 1942. But they remained at pitiful levels until after the harvest of 1943. By that time, all but a tiny remnant of the Jewish population was dead.  The upshot of this train of argument is that the grand contradiction between economics and ideology with which we started this chapter needs to be revised in a number of ways.

Whereas the Polish ration was to be cut off in March 1943, the feeding of 1.2 million Jews was a particular point of stressing the importance of the Ukraine for Germany’s food supply.121 Goebbels for his part coined a new propaganda line. Germany, he declared, was ‘digesting’ the ‘occupied territories’. A few days later, at the annual harvest festival, Goering triumphantly announced the imminent restoration of rations in Germany. 122 As of 19 October, the food rations for both Germans tons to 8.78 million tons (measured in grain equivalents).103 In 1942—3 occupied Europe supplied Germany with more than a fifth of its grain, a quarter
