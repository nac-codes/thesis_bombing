It is also clear that if the harvest of the General Government had not been as good as it turned out to bein 1942, then millions of non-Jewish Poles would have been condemned to starve the following spring. However, in the summer of 1942 it was the concerted extermination of Polish Jewry that provided the most immediate and fail-safe means of freeing up food for delivery to Germany. IV  In response to the crisis on the Eastern Front, the organization of the German war effort in the spring of 1942 underwent three crucial shifts. Two of these have been examined in this chapter: the  Page 545 of 800 67% etna titan” atari iia, — alert aioli — OKW in early 1942 made clear. It was simply a matter of calories and muscle power. It is also clear that if the harvest of the General Government had not been as good as it turned out to be in 1942, then emergence of the Backe-Himmler-Goering axis on the food question, and Gauleiter Sauckel’s appointment in the spring of 1942 as GBA.195 The third, the appointment of Hitler’s personal favourite Albert Speer to replace Fritz Todt as
