-image that Speer shared with Hitler. A less romantic rendition casts Speer as an ‘unpolitical technician’, a man given ‘unpolitical Speer’ was solidly founded on the second pillar of the Speer myth, the myth of the so-called ‘armaments miracle’. This refers to the remarkable upsurge in the armaments output apparently presided over by Speer after February 1942, an upsurge that was widely credited with keeping Germany in the war (see Appendix, Table A6). On the assumption that Nazi ideology and technocratic efficiency were mutually exclusive, Speer’s triumphant production record was enough in itself to put distance between him and other less appetizing defendants in the dock at Nuremberg. Speer was simply too intelligent, too good at his job, to be compared to primitive anti-Semites such as Julius Streicher, or self-seeking ogres like Hermann Goering. Yet Speer’s claim to have been an unpolitical actor was always self-evidently absurd.

From the first May Day celebration of 1933 onwards, Speer was personally responsible for crafting the dramatic public image of the regime.

From the late 1930s onwards he also enjoyed a cooperative working relationship with Heinrich Himmler and the SS. After the outbreak of the war, Speer accumulated a wide portfolio of projects, including the entire
