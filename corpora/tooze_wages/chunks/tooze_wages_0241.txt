1930s onwards he also enjoyed a cooperative working relationship with Heinrich Himmler and the SS. After the outbreak of the war, Speer accumulated a wide portfolio of projects, including the entire construction programme of the Luftwaffe as well as a number of major building sites in the occupied Eastern territories. When Fritz Todt was killed in his mysterious accident, Speer was not perhaps his most obvious successor. But neither was he a rank outsider. He was clearly one of the few men that Hitler really trusted and Speer’s enormous influence after 1942 depended above all on that fact.  For our purposes, however, the more fundamental point concerns the second element of the Speer myth: Speer’s role in relation to the armaments economy. Rather than seeing the performance of the German war economy as a warrant for Speer’s status as an unpolitical technician, the point to be stressed here is the eminently political function that Speer’s ‘armaments miracle’ performed for Hitler’s regime. Of all Albert Sveer’s contributions to Nazi propaganda. the ‘armaments miracle’ was bv far the most imvortant. From his first davs in his new iob. Sveer disvlaved a clear consciousness of the regime. Of all Albert Speer’s contributions to Nazi propaganda, the ‘armaments miracle’ was by far the most important. From his first days in his new job, Speer displayed a clear consciousness of the symbolic importance of the armaments effort. He did not simply produce more weapons. He made them tell a story.

The solipsistic rhetoric of production records served to silence the wider questions that had crowded in upon the German leadership during the winter crisis of 1941-2. As we have seen, at that point, all the men most closely associated with the organization of the German war
