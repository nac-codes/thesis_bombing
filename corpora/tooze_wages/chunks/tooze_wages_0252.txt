of the Zentrale Planung that gave him a genuine claim to overarching authority. In practice, however, what transpired in the Zentrale Planung was a collective effort, dominated by Speer and Milch who between them controlled 90 per cent of the armaments economy. Milch attended virtually every session and spoke as the absolute authority in his sector.22 The significant difference between Speer and Milch was political, not functional. Speer’s unrivalled access to Hitler made him the chief conduit through which the Fuehrer’s priorities were transmitted down the chain of command. Since 1936 there had been numerous efforts to create a central governing authority for the German armaments effort, all of them in various ways centred around the figure of Goering. Even in 1942, Speer’s official title was as Goering’s special plenipotentiary for armaments and the Zentrale Planung met formally with Goering’s blessing. Given this history, the real significance of the Zentrale Planung was the fact that it did actually meet on a regular basis, thus establishing a true institutional legitimacy, as well as increasingly formalized proceedings and a proper order of business. In total, between 27 April 1942 and the end of the war, the Zentrale Planung met sixty-two times. Fifty-two of these meetings took place in the first twenty months of its existence between April 1942 and the end of 1943, roughly one session every ten days, thus establishing the Zentrale Planung as the true war cabinet of the German economy.
