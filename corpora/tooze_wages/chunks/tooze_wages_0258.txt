Affairs. In 1939 Schieber was appointed Gau economic adviser in Thuringia and the following year he moved to Berlin to serve Fritz Todt as his chief adviser for chemical issues. Schieber also cultivated close links with the SS, holding the honorary rank of SS Brigadefuehrer and participating regularly in the meetings of the Freundeskreis Heinrich Himmler, a group of businessmen particularly closely associated with the regime. After Todt’s death it was only logical that Schieber, like Saur, should play a key role in Speer’s Ministry, as head of the Ruestungslieferungsamt (office for armaments supplies). To further consolidate relations Page 559 of 800 68% France created an identification with Hitler and his regime that was more complete than at any point before or afterwards.20 Unlike the attack on France in May 1940, which was expected with fearful Voegler of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke, was to establish a new set of organizations to manage the supply of raw materials, semi-finished products and subcomponents, known as ‘Rings’.25 There were five between the Ministry and the business community, Schieber was appointed to act as Zangen’s deputy at the Reich Group for industry.32 In total, at the end of 1942, the telephone book of the Speer Ministry listed 249 Committees and Subcommittees, Rings and Sub-Rings.38 Obviously, an organization as ramified as this defies simple categorization. Speer’s own slogan was ‘Selbstverantwortung’, the ‘self-responsibility’ of industry. The Reich Armaments Ministry would set the targets, leaving responsibility for meeting them to Ger- man industry. And on closer inspection, the chairmen of Speer’s Committees and Rings appear to have been a carefully weighted cross-section of the German industrial establishment. Of the list of the top one hundred industrial firms in 1938 there was not one that did not hold the chairmanship of at least one of Speer’s Subcommittees or Rings, and the number of chairmanships allocated to each company correspo
