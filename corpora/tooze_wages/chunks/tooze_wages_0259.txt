dred industrial firms in 1938 there was not one that did not hold the chairmanship of at least one of Speer’s Subcommittees or Rings, and the number of chairmanships allocated to each company corresponded predictably to the hierarchy of size and political importance. The Vestag, Germany’s leading heavy industrial conglomerate, held at least twelve chairmanships either directly or through its subsidiaries. This put it on a par with Paul Pleiger’s Reichswerke. Siemens was well represented with Dr Friedrich Lueschen occupying a pivotal position as chair both of the Main Com- mittee for Communications Equipment and the Main Ring for Electrical Subcomponents. In total, Siemens held eight chairmanships. Krupp, AEG, Mannesmann, Rheinmetall, Flick, GHH were all involved. IG Farben held only four chairmanships, but this was hardly surprising given the products covered by the Committee system and the role played by Carl Krauch in the Four Year Plan. With the chairman of its supervisory board overseeing the planning of the entire chemical war effort, there was little need for IG to dirty its hands with further Committee work. Zeiss and Zeiss-Ikon over- saw three Subcommittees for precision optics. Bosch was responsible for fuel injection, and its Blaupunkt subsidiary oversaw electro-acoustic equipment. The Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke (dom- inated by the Metallgesellschaft) were responsible for nonferrous components for the aircraft industry. But as well as including Germany’s largest industrial corporations, an important feature of Speer’s system was its enrolment of dozens of smaller suppliers of sub-components and parts. Apart from the members of the top one hundred, there were seventy other firms that chaired one or more Subcommittee or Ring: Bauer & Schaurte for screws and fastenings; Mahle for pistons; Kugelfischer for roller bearings; Koch & Sterzel for electrical transformers; Klein, Schanzlin & Becker for valves; Karl Schmidt of Neckar-sulm for vehicle components;
