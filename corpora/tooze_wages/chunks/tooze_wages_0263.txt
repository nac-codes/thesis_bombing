s proposed as part of a fiscal consolidation package designed to curb corporate profits and reduce state expenditure, thus helping to prick the inflationary bubble. In the name of rationalization, the standard prices were subject to a general 10 per cent deduction. Furthermore, a serious clawback was threatened in relation to profits earned in 1940 and 1941. But after Gauleiter Wagner’s departure and his replacement by the Austrian banker Hans Fischboeck, the tone softened markedly.46 Certainly there were no more threats of resignation from Zangen and his colleagues. The new standard price system was accompanied by a cast-iron promise from Speer that those who met the price would be exempt from any further official inspections and would be free to retain a large part of the profits they earned by beating the standard costing. Responsibility for dealing with excess profit shifted from the price commissioner to the Finance Ministry, and the excess profit guidelines issued at the end of March 1942 certainly did little to dampen industrial enthusiasm. Only profits more than 50 per cent higher than those earned in 1938 were subject to excess profit tax, giving an in-built advantage to those firms who had already profited from rearmament before the war.42 And Albert Speer made clear that he would accept no interference in his sphere of activity by the meddling ‘bureaucrats’ of the Finance Ministry and the price commissioner.
