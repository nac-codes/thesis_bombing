rmaments factories in the twelve months that followed the Moscow crisis were more than offset by an influx of 970,000 foreign workers provided by Sauckel. And the prime beneficiaries were in Speer’s sector.42 Whereas the overall increase in the armaments workforce in 1942 came to only 15 per cent, in Speer’s sector of army production the increase was in excess of 30 per cent. Of the increase of 513,000 workers that could be attributed specifically to one of the three branches of the Wehrmacht, Speer’s area of responsibility claimed no less than 420,000.22 Speer’s top-priority programmes were lavishly provided. The tank workforce in 1942 increased by almost 60 per cent and by an even larger percentage in 1943. In the case of locomotive building, one of Speer’s most widely touted success stories, the dramatic increase in annual production, from 1,918 locomotives in 1941 to 5,343 in 1943, was underpinned by a 90 per cent increase in the workforce in 1942 alone.+! All of this was the exact reverse of the pattern in 1941, when the prime beneficiaries of labour mobilization had been the Luftwaffe and the navy.22  For cash, food and labour Speer could rely on others. His own particular contribution to resource mobilization was in the sphere of raw materials. Though the Zentrale Planung was clearly a major  Page 563 of 800 69% organizational innovation, the subject matter of its meetings was achingly familiar. The overriding preoccupation was steel. Thirty of sixty-two meetings were addressed directly to this issue.53 In addition, eleven sessions were devoted to coal, which was important above all because the supply of coal determined the quantity of steel that could be produced. Another eight sessions dealt with issues connected to the labour supply in which the coal mines had first priority. Even in apparently unrelated fields such as the chemicals programme, the issue at stake was steel. Chemicals were an unavoidable issue for the Zentrale Planung because the entire war
