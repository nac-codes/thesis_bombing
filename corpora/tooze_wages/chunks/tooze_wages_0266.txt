first priority. Even in apparently unrelated fields such as the chemicals programme, the issue at stake was steel. Chemicals were an unavoidable issue for the Zentrale Planung because the entire war machine would grind to a halt without fuel. Nitrogen, furthermore, was the key ingredient both for explosives and fertilizer. However, the Zentrale Planung had a claim to control over Carl Krauch and his chemicals, because Krauch’s gigantic factories needed substantial allocations of steel. The conclusion is inescapable: whoever was in charge of the armaments economy and however they organized their authority, steel remained at the heart of German armaments politics, before and after February 1942. Steel was indispensable for all armaments production outside the Luftwaffe. Even the Luftwaffe needed steel for bombs, anti-aircraft guns and airfield installations. But, as we have seen repeatedly since 1937, within the Wehrmacht’s steel budget the great swing variable was the quantity of steel allocated to ammunition. The easiest way to relieve pressure on German heavy industry was to cut back ammunition production, releasing steel for other uses. This had been done in 1937, in the summer of 1939 and again in the summer of 1940. In 1942, faced with the prospect of a long and bloody war in Russia, this was no longer an option. In the months following the Moscow crisis, Hitler returned to the obsession that had gripped him in the first months of the war.24 The ‘armaments pro- gramme 1942’ announced on 10 January, a month before Speer took office, called for the creation of new stocks of ammunition sufficient to cover six months at the heavy rates of consumption experi- enced in 1941. These targets were specified with the summer offensive in mind. But Hitler also now had to secure himself against the prospect of a long war on two fronts. At the end of March, the OKW noted, ‘Fuehrer has ordered Speer to run up ammunition production on a really big scale, so that two-front trenc
