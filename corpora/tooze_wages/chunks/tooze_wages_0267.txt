himself against the prospect of a long war on two fronts. At the end of March, the OKW noted, ‘Fuehrer has ordered Speer to run up ammunition production on a really big scale, so that two-front trench war can be fought for years’.55 Nor can one fault the logic of concentrating on ammunition first. Due to its sheer size. the ammunition programme conditioned all the choices that followed. Ammunition did not receive the same attention in Speer’s armaments propaganda as  Page 565 of 800 69% could be attributed specifically to one of the three branches of the Wehrmacht, Speer’s area of responsibility claimed no less than 420,000.52 Speer’s top-priority programmes were lavishly provided.

Due to its sheer size, the ammunition programme conditioned all the choices that followed. Ammunition did not receive the same attention in Speer’s armaments propaganda as more glamorous items such as tanks.26 Ammunition belonged rather to the visual repertoire of World War I than to the ‘Blitzkrieg’ campaigns of Hitler’s war. But shells, bombs and bullets in fact accounted for 50 per cent of the total increase in armaments production in the first eight months of Speer’s tenure.22 Even in the middle of 1943, at the end of the first phase of the armaments miracle, ammunition accounted for half the increase achieved within Speer’s personal sphere of responsibility. A proper sense of proportion is conveyed if we consider the relative scope of the three Main Arma- ments Committees overseen by Speer’s Ministry. In the autumn of 1943, 450,000 workers were employed in ammunition production, compared with 160,000 making tanks and 210,000 making weapons.28 In terms of steel, ammunition’s dominance was even more pronounced. In the last quarter of 1942 it hogged more than half the army’
