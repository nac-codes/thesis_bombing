ion, compared with 160,000 making tanks and 210,000 making weapons.28 In terms of steel, ammunition’s dominance was even more pronounced. In the last quarter of 1942 it hogged more than half the army’s total allocation of steel, as compared to 15 per cent each going to tanks and weapons.22 Ammunition’s political ramifications were no less significant. As in 1939-40, meeting Hitler’s huge new ammunition demands required an immediate and wrench-  dae vnnllanatian af vac mataviale tha imnant afuthish aauld antler ha anftanad in tha madi tae hen cithotantial inavanen in tha avtnut af otanl OKW noted, ‘Fuehrer has ordered Speer to run up ammunition production on a really big scale, so that two-front trench war can be fought for years’.5> Nor can one fault the logic of concentrating on more glamorous items such as tanks.2>© Ammunition belonged rather to the visual repertoire of World War I than to the ‘Blitzkrieg’ campaigns of Hitler’s war. But shells, bombs and bullets in fact accounted for 50 per cent of the total increase in armaments production in the first eight months of Speer’s tenure.” Even in the middle of 1943, at the end of the first phase of the armaments miracle, ing reallocation of raw materials the impact of which could only be softened in the medium term by a substantial increase in the output of steel. The scale of the shift was dramatic. In the last quarter of 1941, in line with the priorities of armaments planning set before Barbarossa, the German army out of its measly ration of 185,000 tons of steel had proposed to allocate only 25,000 tons to ammunition. Now Hitler demanded that the ammunition programme should be established with a regular monthly quota of no less than 350,000 tons of steel, an increase by a factor of 14.62 Even before Speer took office, the army’s overall steel ration had been doubled to more than 350,000 tons per month in the first quarter of 1942. This was ‘paid for’ in part by cuts to the Luftwaffe’s expansion plans and sharp red
