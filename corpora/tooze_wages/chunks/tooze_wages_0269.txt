the army’s overall steel ration had been doubled to more than 350,000 tons per month in the first quarter of 1942. This was ‘paid for’ in part by cuts to the Luftwaffe’s expansion plans and sharp reductions in the production of bombs and anti-aircraft shells. The navy’s ration was also cut. But this was not enough to make room for the army’s new needs. In 1942 large quantities of steel were still being allocated to the investment programmes begun in 1940 and 1941, and significant quantities of steel were still going to export orders. The immediate effect of the crisis on the Eastern Front and the sudden need to give top priority to the army was therefore to exacerbate the ‘steel inflation’ that had already been causing increasing concern in the autumn of 1941. Significantly more steel entitlements were issued than there were quantities of actual steel. So large was the discrepancy that it threatened to disorganize the entire war effort. Steel producers overloaded with orders, all of which were backed by official steel entitlements, were free to pick and choose the grades of steel they produced. High-priority programmes were forced to wait for months before their requirements were met. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of tons of steel went to waste because they were delivered after the armaments programmes for which they were intended had been cancelled.  The first task of Speer’s new administration was to get to grips with this ‘ration inflation’. As we have seen, the crisis of the coal sector in 1941 had led to the formation in March 1941 of the Reich coal organization (RVK) under Paul Pleiger, which managed both the production and distribution of coal. In the spring of 1942, the Reich Ministrv for Economic Affairs began to push for the formation A ae - The tank workforce i in 1942 increased by almost 60 per cent and by an even larger percentage in 1943. In the case of locomotive building, on one of Speer’s most widely touted success stories, the dramatic organiza
