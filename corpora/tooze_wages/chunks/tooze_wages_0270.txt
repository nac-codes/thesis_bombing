orce i in 1942 increased by almost 60 per cent and by an even larger percentage in 1943. In the case of locomotive building, on one of Speer’s most widely touted success stories, the dramatic organizational innovation, the subject matter of its meetings was achingly familiar. The overriding preoccupation was steel. Thirty of sixty-two meetings were addressed directly to this issue.23 In OKW noted, ‘Fuehrer has ordered Speer to run up ammunition production on a really big scale, so that two-front trench war can be fought for years’.25 Nor can one fault the logic of concentrating on tons of steel, an increase by a factor of 14.82 Even before Speer took office, the army’s overall steel ration had been doubled to more than 350,000 tons per month in the first quarter of 1942. This was coal organization (RVK) under Paul Pleiger, which managed both the production and distribution of coal. In the spring of 1942, the Reich Ministry for Economic Affairs began to push for the formation of a similar organization for the steel industry. This finally came to fruition on 1 June 1942, in the form of the Reichsvereinigung Eisen (RVE).£1 What the Reich Ministry seems initially to have had in mind was an industrial dictatorship headed by a single individual, a ‘steel tsar’. What actually emerged was a classic compromise between the key interest groups in the German steel industry, bartered between Speer and Albert Voegler, who as chairman of the Vestag supervisory board was still the dominant figure in the German steel industry.£2 Instead of the unworkable idea of a steel dictator, who would have been bound to attract hostility from one or more of the major steel regions, the RVE was run by a chairman flanked by a powerful presidium, in which all of the major steel interests were represented. Initially, Speer suggested to Hitler that Voegler himself should chair the RVE, but, as Speer noted, ‘He [Hitler] considers my suggestion of Voegler acceptable, but believes that Roechling would
