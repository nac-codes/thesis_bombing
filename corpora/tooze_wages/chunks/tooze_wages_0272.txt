Hermann Roechling was certainly one of the regime’s most prominent industrial collaborators, but he debates of World War I. Throughout his long career, Roechling’s overriding preoccupation was the expansion of German control over the Lorraine and its adjoining areas.®4 But, despite his prominence Ten days after his appointment Roechling spelled out to an assembly of leading steel industrialists precisely what was at stake.6© The steel industry had to be raised to a new peak of performance. On their success hung both the future of the German war effort and the ‘future of the private economy’. The battles raging on the Eastern Front left no doubt about the seriousness of the situation. The performance of Soviet industry, as Roechling frankly acknowledged, had been nothing short of miraculous. Even in besieged Leningrad fresh tanks continued to roll off the production lines. Despite the destruction of no less than 20,000 Soviet combat aircraft, the Red Air Force was still throwing new planes into combat. How had the Soviet Union managed to build and sustain engineering capacity of such robust quality and quantity? The battle on the Eastern Front was a true battle of the systems. It was not Roechling’s place to speculate about the military outcome of the war. But the question as far as the economy was concerned was clear-cut. ‘To justify the existence of the private economy we must achieve extraordinary performance... If we... should not succeed, people are probably going to try other means.’ And, Roechling continued, ‘In the end what this is about is whether or not the private economy can produce the necessary results ... or whether other forms of  arganization are needed’ This surely ic the hact characterizatinn af the Sneer evstem certainly in its first aishteen manthe What emerced in
