Kehrl was no steel expert. But he had consolidated his reputation as one of the toughest practitioners firms in fact managed to maintain production at a relatively high level, at least until the last quarter of 1941.2 But after that output began to fall sharply, bottoming out in early 1942, when the supply 1942, Speer and Hitler had agreed that Germany would need to raise monthly production by at least 600,000 tons by the end of the year.22 As Roechling presented it to the steel industry in the summer Sweden badly needed to rebuild their stocks if they were to avoid disaster in the coming winter months, on top of which Pleiger also had to consider the German electricity grid and Krauch’s synthetic chemicals plants. Civilian morale was already suffering under shortages of household coal. Speer’s suggestion that British coal rationing was even more severe than that in Germany was immediately refuted by RVK statistics.

At this point Gauleiter Sauckel stepped in to ass
