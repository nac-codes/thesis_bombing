At this point Gauleiter Sauckel stepped in to assure Hitler that he was perfectly capable of supplying the labour that Pleiger demanded. Hitler concurred. ‘If this question could not be resolved on a voluntary basis, he would agree to any coercive measure, and this applied to the Western occupied territories as well, not only in the East.'24 However, given his experience with the malnourished and demoralized Eastern workers, Pleiger was not reassured.
