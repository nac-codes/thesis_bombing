med to need 2.12 million tons of coal per month. In October 1942 it had received only 1.4 million tons and Pleiger now proposed to slash this to 925,000 tons. This would imply a 40 per cent cut in iron production, with disastrous consequences for the entire armaments programme. Without adequate workers, Pleiger could not dig coal. Sauckel had not delivered the 120,000 men he had promised. The pits were short of 107,417 miners. A further 9,000 were needed by the railway system serving the mines. To make matters worse, the Ruhr was suffering an epidemic of absenteeism, with some shifts reporting up to 60 per cent sick.22 What now threatened the German economy was a chain reaction like those that had caused such disruption during the winters of 1939-40 and 1941-282 Inadequate coal supplies would lead to power cuts and bottlenecks radiating across the economy. For Speer, a failure to resolve the problems of coal and steel would be a political disaster. As he put it to the Zentrale Planung, it would be ‘a conclusion that would do severe damage to the theory which I generally advocate, namely that we get furthest by relying on the self-responsibility of industry’ 81 The implied threat was obvious. Pleiger’s inabilitv to meet his delivery targets ‘entailed such grave consequences as to make it impossible for anvbodv in Zentrale Planung to accept responsibilitv: such Page 570 of 800 70% firms 1n fact managed to maintain production at a relatively hign level, at least unt the last quarter of 1941.“ but after that output began to fall sharply, bottoming out in early 1942, when the supply kind of brutal clarity. After a moment of stunned silence, Pleiger was left with no alternative but to reply: ‘My Fuehrer, I will do everything humanly possible to achieve the goal.’25 Somehow, the iron ‘after us there is nothing, everything will be over ... Germany will be destroyed. Everybody will be slaughtered, murdered, burned and destroyed.’26 Nevertheless, in August 1942, in the more s
