Auto-Union.22 At Junkers, Koppenberg was unceremoniously shunted into retirement. Junkers itself was subject to a tight new regime of financial oversight. At Messerschmitt, Milch exploited Willy Messerschmitt’s embarrassment over the failure of the Me 210 (about which we shall have more to say below) to remove him from managerial control. To further curb corporate autonomy, Milch ended the easygoing financial arrangements under which manufacturers received advance payment for their deliveries to the Air Ministry. At Heinkel, this produced a financial crisis, which Milch used to restructure the management and to push Ernst Heinkel into a purely developmental role. All three major aircraft developers-Junkers, Messerschmitt and Heinkel—were thus brought under direct Ministerial control.  It was only after he had decisively re-established the authority of the Air Ministry that Milch began to promote an agenda of rationalization, in the sense of optimizing manufacturing efficiency. For airframes, aero-engines and aircraft equipment, Milch established a system of Rings, later renamed to match Todt and Speer’s Main Committees. Karl Frydag, chief engineer from the Henschel corporation, headed the Airframe Ring. William Werner ran the Aero-engine Ring. Hans Heyne of AEG-Telefunken oversaw the aircraft equipment industry.21 They too were advocates of ‘American- style’ mass-production. Werner had worked at Chrysler, Heyne was a protégé of General Electric. But unlike the empire builders of the 1930s, theirs was the mantra of ‘more for less’. Werner, in particular, introduced himself in 1941 with a series of devastating reports on the antediluvian metalworking practices commonplace in aero-engine production.22 He was particularly incensed by the wastage of raw materials resulting from the application of traditional metal-cutting techniques. As he put it ina much-quoted report, the German aero-engine industry was producing more waste chips, by weight, than engines.23 developmen
