tion had to be restricted to a limited number of models and these had to be ‘frozen’ for a sufficiently long period of time for the factories to gain significant economies of scale. There was therefore an inescapable trade-off between quantity and quality. Since Germany could not hope to compete directly with America’s volume of output, this was not a trade-off to strike easily. As we have seen, in 1941 Udet had held off from committing more resources to the mass-production of existing models, precisely because he hoped that new aircraft under development, most notably the Me 210 and He 177, would offer a significant advance in technology. By the end of the year, with Udet dead, Milch found himself facing two humbling development disasters. One must be careful not to read too much into these problems. To conclude that they reflected some deep-seated structural weakness in the German military-industrial complex is wide of the mark.28 After all, Germany was already well advanced in developing a new generation of jet-engined planes that were at the cutting edge of aeronautical engineering. The development problems encountered with the Me 210 combat aircraft were due to a high stakes gamble in which the Luftwaffe had en- gaged in the late 1930s.22 Rather than going through the normal four-year development cycle from prototype to series production, the Air Ministry had attempted to leap ahead in the air race by shortening the timeline to three years. This involved the deliberate risk of rushing into series production aircraft that were not yet fully tested. In the case of the Ju 88, the gamble did not backfire. Though the Ju 88 was not the miracle weapon that Goering had been promised, it was certainly a serviceable aircraft. And neither the Me 210 heavy fighter nor even Heinkel’s ill-fated He 177 was a true dud. Bv 1943 both had emerged as viable combat aircraft. What both aircraft needed was more time in development and a more reasonable design svecification. In earlv
