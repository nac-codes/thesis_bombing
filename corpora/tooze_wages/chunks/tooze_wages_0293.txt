nkel’s ill-fated He 177 was a true dud. Bv 1943 both had emerged as viable combat aircraft. What both aircraft needed was more time in development and a more reasonable design svecification. In earlv 1942. however. this was Page 577 of 800 1% By the same token, however, the agglomeration of resources 1n the pursuit of ‘efficiency’ and ‘scale’ was also one of the principal drivers of internecine industrial competition, entirely Incompatible There can be little doubt, of course, that Werner was right. But his aggressive rhetoric of reform and improvement must be seen in context. What Werner was voicing was the critique developed true dud. By 1943 both had emerged as viable combat aircraft. What both aircraft needed was more time in development and a more reasonable design specification. In early 1942, however, this was little consolation to Erhard Milch. Hundreds of dangerously unstable Me 210s were coming off the production lines at Messerschmitt’s Regensburg and Augsburg facilities. Even more half-finished planes were piling up in the assembly halls, and parts for another 800 aircraft were already in stock. Milch had no option but to cut his losses and cancel the entire programme. Instead, in a desperate bid to match quantity with quantity Milch decided to concentrate all available capacity on the mass-production of those models that had been tried and tested in the first years of the war.102 The new focus on mass-production certainly produced results. By the summer of 1943, aircraft production was more than double the level in the winter of 1941-2. The gap that had opened up between Britain and Germany was substantially reduced. For the first time, the German aircraft industry was able to achieve substantial economies of scale. The resources pumped into the Luftwaffe in 1940-41 were now concentrated in mass assembly. The available machine tools were set up in an efficient manner to produce long series of identical aircraft. There was nothing miraculous about  this
