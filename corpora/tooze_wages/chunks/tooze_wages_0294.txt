n 1940-41 were now concentrated in mass assembly. The available machine tools were set up in an efficient manner to produce long series of identical aircraft. There was nothing miraculous about  this process, however.

Werner’s critique of existing production practice could have been made with equal force of virtually any factory in Germany-or anywhere else in the world for that matter—at any time since the early 1930s. Indeed, Werner had been making his case to the Air Ministry for at least two years before he was finally taken up at the national level by Fritz Todt.2& His critique was brought to the Furthermore, as was obvious to all involved, mass-production of extremely complex machinery such as aircraft came at a price.22 Production had to be restricted to a limited number of models and bid to match quantity with quantity Milch decided to concentrate all available capacity on the mass-production of those models that had been tried and tested in the first years of the war.100 this process, however.
