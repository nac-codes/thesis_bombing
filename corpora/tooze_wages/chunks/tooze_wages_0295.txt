the first years of the war.100 this process, however. Ever since the 1920s, when full metal aircraft had first been introduced, German aircraft engineers had estimated that costs would decline in a geometric progression, as the scale of production increased.101 They had even calculated a formula describing these so-called learning-curve effects in algebraic terms. And experience in the 1940s proved that these predictions were remarkably accurate. Costs plunged as each factory concentrated on ‘its’ standard model. Germany continued to manufacture in somewhat smaller batches than did the Americans. But what is striking about the production record after 1942 is not how far apart but how close per capita productivity became. Whereas in most manufacturing industry the United States enjoyed an advantage over Ger- many of at least 2:1, the differential in airframes in 1942 and 1943 was no more than 50 per cent.102 But the price that Germany paid for this quantitative expansion in output was a high one: the increasing technological obsolescence of the Luftwaffe’s armoury. As early as October 1941 a commis- sion of front-line airmen, charged by the air staff with evaluating the Luftwaffe’s development programme, had expressed horrified disbelief at Milch’s demand for a large increase in the production of Heinkel 111s.103 The Luftwaffe had first tested this medium bomber in February 1934, when Goering’s air force was still in its clandestine phase. At the time the He 111 had been an advanced aircraft and had benefited from continuous upgrading. But in the autumn of 1941 Luftwaffe commanders considered it unsuitable for use over Britain, even under cover of night. As it turned out, the He 111, along with the Luftwaffe’s other twin-engined aircraft such as the Me 110 and 210/410, gained a new lease on life after 1942 in a defensive role, as night fighters in the battle against the RAF. Since RAF Bomber Command flew its missions without fighter escorts, the task of night interc
