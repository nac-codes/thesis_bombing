At the time the He 111 had been an advanced aircraft Me 110 and 210/410, gained a new lease on life after 1942 in a defensive role, as night fighters in the battle against the RAF. Since e task of night interception put little premium on absolute speed or manoeuvrability. To track down and destroy the slow-moving ed were bulky electronics and heavy guns which could be easily accommodated in the twin-engined bombers of 1930s vintage. It was not until the US in the Spanish Civi s in the second half of 1943, directly challenging the Luftwaffe’s fighter forces, that the true costs of Milch’s development decision began to make strength were Me 109s. Of the huge increases in aircraft output achieved by Milch after 1942, these fighters accounted for by far the War in 1937, Messerschmitt’s 109 had been state of the art.
