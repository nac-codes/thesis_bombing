end of September 1942 General Fromm, as chief of the army’s armaments supply, submitted a memorandum to Hitler demanding a negotiated end to the war as the only By the end of September he had replaced Halder as chief of staff and Fromm was well on his way to political oblivion.122 As the bitter resistance of the Red Army prolonged the war in the East into its second year, the odds against the Wehrmacht lengthened. As compared to the autumn of 1941, when the Germans and their allies had at times enjoyed substantial numerical superiority over the Red Army, by the autumn of 1942 the correlation of forces favoured the Soviets by a margin that tended towards 2 to 1.123 Given the horrendous casualties suffered by the Soviets up to the autumn of 1942, this was as much a testament to the extraordinary mobilizing capacity of Stalin’s regime as a reflection of the underlying demographic balance. Even more remarkable, however, was the fact that, at key points in the line, the Soviets were able to back their superiority in manpower with a similar preponderance of guns, tanks and aircraft. The fact was that despite the optimistic newsreel propaganda, Speer and Milch were losing the battle of the factories. Even leaving aside the British and Americans, who produced under far more favourable circumstances, Germany was being outdone by the embattled Soviet Union. If there was a true ‘armaments miracle’ in 1942 it occurred, not in Germany, but in the armaments factories in the Urals. Despite having suffered territorial losses and disruption that resulted in a 25 per cent fall in total national product, the Soviet Union in 1942 managed to out-produce Germany in virtually every category of weapons. The margin for small arms and artillery was 3:1. For tanks it was a staggering 4:1, a differential compounded by the superior quality of the T34 tank. Even in combat aircraft the margin was 2:1.124 It was this industrial superiority, contrary to every expectation, that allowed the Red Army,
