SC 122, totalling 100 ships, fought the biggest single convoy battle of the war with three packs of 40 U-boats. The Allies lost 21 vessels rated at 140,842 tons. Dozens of U-boats were badly damaged, but only one was sunk. It was, declared Admiral Doenitz, the greatest victory of the U-boat arm. But such successes could not disguise the increasingly one-sided nature of the battle. Of the seventeen major convoys crossing the Atlantic in mid-March 1943, the U-boats intercepted only three. Though total U-boat sinkings in March 1943 came to almost 650,000 tons, this was not enough to seriously threaten the trans-Atlantic supply line. Losses of Allied shipping ran at in excess of 500,000 tons per month throughout 1942 and early 1943, but were more than made up by the enormous production af America’s dackwards which were naw canahle of turning aut more than a millian tane af shinning ner manth Fram Auoctict 1949 anwards under canstant TI-hnat attack Allied shinning canacitw Page 589 of 800 72% arrived in Suez the Afrika Korps, whose tank strength rarely exceeded 250 vehicles, would be hopelessly outnumbered.

From August 1942 onwards, under constant U-boat attack, Allied shipping capacity was expanding not contracting. Meanwhile, U-boat losses were rising alarmingly. Guided by the decrypts of the U-boats’ radio communications, deploying new sonar equipment and complete air supremacy, the British and American navies broke the submarine menace. By May 1943, Admiral Doenitz was losing U-boats and crews at the rate of one per day. With a fifth of his Atlantic fleet sunk in a single month, Doenitz gave the order on 24 May 1943 for the wolf-packs to withdraw. Unable to sustain a battle of attrition against the overwhelming industrial and technological superiority of its enemies, the weakest
