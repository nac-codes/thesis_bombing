a broad front’ was not the rallying cry that Speer and Hitler needed in the desperate winter of 1942-3. They needed a ‘big story’ with which to re-energize the home front. The answer was the Adolf Hitler Panzer Programme, announced to enormous fanfare on 22 January 1943.12  Tanks were, of course, nothing new for the German armaments effort and Speer clearly appreciated their symbolic importance from the outset.

Gigantic new production centres were under construction, most notably the Nibelungenwerk at Sankt Valentin near Linz. In early September 1942, Speer agreed with Rohland, the chair of the Main Committee for Tanks, on a new produc- tion target of 1,400 vehicles per month by the spring of 1944, made up of 600 Panthers, 50 Tigers, 150 light tanks and a mixture of 600 assault guns and self-propelled artillery.14 Under the impact of the Stalingrad disaster, Hitler took the impulsive decision to double this figure.
