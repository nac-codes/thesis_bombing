triumph with an even more dramatic record of his own: the production of 2,200 combat aircraft in a single month. This was in every respect a more significant achievement than Speer’s heralded production of 1,270 tanks. For Karl Frydag, who, as senior engineer at Henschel, oversaw both the production of the Tiger tank and the Main Committee for Airframes, there was no comparison: ‘Tank production and Luftwaffe production are always being compared to each other. They cannot be compared; tank production is dirt, when set against the Luftwaffe.’21 In light of the armaments statistics, it is hard to disagree. In terms of value produced or resources consumed, the production of combat aircraft was at least five times more important than the output of tanks. The Adolf Hitler Panzer Programme maintained the propagandistic excitement surrounding Speer’s Armaments Ministry in the first half of 1943.22 However, what would determine the future of armaments production was the supply of steel. Driving their workers and plants to breaking point, the steel mills managed to raise output in March 1943 to in excess of 2.7 million tons, sufficient to  Page 592 of 800 73% ianks were, of course, nothing new ror the Geriman armaments errort and opeer ciearly appreciated their symbolic importance from the outset. within days Of taking office he had made an extended comparison: ‘Tank production and Luftwaffe production are always being compared to each other.
