ty of raising steel output by a further 1 million tons, enabling the extraordinary increases in armaments output to be continued into another year.24 In late May 1943, as the Ostheer readied itself for its last great effort to stabilize the Eastern Front by means of an attack against the Soviet salient at Kursk, the Reich steel association presented detailed estimates of what might be possible, if Germany could retain control of the manganese deposits of the Ukraine. On the assumption that Field Marshal Manstein could hold Krivoj Rog, the RVE predicted that it could reach 3 million monthly tons of steel by October 1944, rising to 3.25 million tons in April of 1945.23 On this basis, Speer expected armaments output to go on increasing, at the spectacu- lar rate achieved in his first year of office, for at least another year.  In the spring of 1943, however, the German war economy itself was sucked directly into the fighting. As we have seen, the threat of Anglo-American bombing had bulked large in German strategic thinking at least since 1940. But until early 1943 it proved remarkably easy to counter. The Royal Air Force simply did not have enough heavy bombers to do sustained damage to the German home front, nor did it have the technology necessary to guide them to their targets. The heavy air raids on Luebeck (28/29 March 1942), Rostock (23/24 April 1942) and the ‘thousand-bomber raids’ on Cologne (30/31 May 1942) and Essen (1 June 1942) gave some indication of what was in store, but they did not develop into a sustained campaign of aerial destruction.26 It was not until March 1943 that RAF Bomber Command had the planes with which to mount a prolonged attack on the heart of German heavy industry, or the technology with which to guide them to their targets. The ‘Battle of the Ruhr’ began on 5 March with an attack on the industrial city of Essen, the home of Krupp.22 Between 8.58 p.m. and 9.36 p.m., following the invisible beam of the OBOE electronic guidance system,
