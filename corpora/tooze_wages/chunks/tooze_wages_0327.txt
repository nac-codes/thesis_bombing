than 2.8 million tons per month and allocated steel accordingly, the Zentrale Planung now faced a shortfall of almost 400,000 tons. All the painstak- ing effort that had gone into reorganizing the rationing system was negated by the ability of the British to disrupt production more or less at will. In light of the steel shortage, Hitler and Speer had no option but to implement an immediate cut to the ammunition programme.34 After more than doubling in 1942, ammunition production in 1943 increased by only 20 per cent.35 And it was not just ammunition that was hit. In the summer of 1943, the disruption in the Ruhr manifested itself across the German economy in a so-called ‘Zulieferungskrise’ (sub-components crisis). All manner of parts, castings and forgings were suddenly in short supply.2® And this affected not only heavy industry directly, but the entire armaments complex. Most significantly, the shortage of key components brought the rapid increase in Luftwaffe production to an abrupt halt. Between July 1943 and March 1944 there was no further increase in the monthly output of aircraft. For the armaments effort as a whole, the period of stagnation lasted throughout the second half of 1943. As Speer himself acknowledged, Allied bombing had negated all plans for a further increase in production.22 Bomber Command had stopped Speer’s armaments miracle in its tracks.  Worse was to come. The mood of relative calm that had prevailed in the spring and early summer of 1943 depended above all on the temporary stabilization of the Eastern Front.
