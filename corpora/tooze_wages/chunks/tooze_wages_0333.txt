The repeated raids on the Ruhr in 1943 had exacted a terrible toll from RAF Bomber Command. Nearly 4,000 crew were killed or taken prisoner, and 640 bombers were shot down or crashed. Terrible as this attrition was, however, thanks to the mounting output of the British aircraft factories, the RAF’s bomber strength actually increased between February and August 1943.48 The Ruhr was the choke point and in 1943 it was within the RAF’s grip. The failure to maintain that hold and to tighten it was a tragic operational error. The ongoing disaster that Speer and his cohorts clearly expected in the summer of 1943 was put off for another year.  With hindsight, therefore, it is clear that the Third Reich was not yet finished. But the impact on contemporaries of the events of July 1943 cannot be exaggerated. Even the most rabid adherents of the Third Reich could hardly deny that the ‘end was nigh’. Hans Kehrl faced this reality, on the first night of Hamburg’s devastation, when he was woken by a telephone call from his close associate Gauleiter Karl Kaufmann, who begged him to accelerate the delivery of several trainloads of quicklime, which would be needed for the rapid disposal of tens of thousands of corpses.42 After Kehrl  errand ta tha Mininters an A veanin fave nd AF tA dim anncinnn Af tha Ainnntae La ae Paend a tamnncners an Manan Das than Gent ton in cranes thin Ahaanaiven vernelen alia veran Faennd tn entre Laman verhanen La Only three days after the Germans launched their assault at Kursk, the British and Americans landed on Sicily.42 Inexcusably, the Allies allowed the Germans to evacuate their garrison, permitting in Hamburg.46 Though the attraction of Berlin as a target was obvious, it was a far larger objective than any of the Ruhr cities and it was at the
