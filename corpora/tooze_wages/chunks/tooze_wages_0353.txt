s in the autumn of 1942.22 Speer, furthermore, had been fully informed of the decision to reallocate the European food supply in 1942. When in 1944 the SS undertook the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of III  The one glimmer of hope that Speer offered his audience at Posen was the prospect that Germany would soon be able to reverse the technological deficit that it had accumulated since the start of the war.Z5 As Germany’s military situation grew more hopeless, the promise of technological miracles began to play an ever more important role in the politics of the Nazi war effort. In 1942 and early 1943, Hitler had placed great hopes in the new generation of Panzers. But at Kursk, neither the Panther nor the Tiger had proved decisive.76 In fact, Hitler was so disillusioned with the Panther that he seriously considered dismantling the surviving vehicles, so as to use their high velocity guns in static anti-tank defences. This pattern of exaggerated expectation followed by devastating disillusionment was to become typical of German weapons development after the winter crisis of 1941-2. And some have been tempted to interpret this cycle as a symptom of deep dysfunction and irrationality, in particular as indicative of the regime’s inability to form wide-ranging networks between military and civilian expertise.22 This, however, is surely to over-dramatize.78 After all, it can hardly be claimed that the German weapon developments programme was significantly less productive than that, say, of Great Britain. The source of the problems lay, not in the peculiar irrationality of the ‘Nazi social system’, but in the hopeless situation in which Germany found itself. The desperate need for a technical fix resulted both in exaggerated hopes being placed in individual weapons systems and in accelerated high-risk development programmes that were made even more unpredictable by the ever-pressing constraints of manpower and materials.
