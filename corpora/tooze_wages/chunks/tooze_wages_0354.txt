The Me 210, the Panther and Tiger tanks, the V1 and V2 rockets, the variety of jet and rocket aircraft, the Mark XXI U-boat, were all promising weapons. By the end of the conflict, the Panther, which had been such a disappointment at Kursk, had developed into a combat vehicle that was the envy of the Western powers and the model for post-war Main Battle Tank development. 72 Its early teething problems, like those of the other miracle weapons, resulted from the fact that it was rushed into combat and mass-production without adequate testing. Furthermore, like all its cousins, it was powerless to affect Germany’s hopeless  Page 609 of 800 75% ) = ae Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz, of which only a minority were designated for work, the movement of this huge number of people caused not even a ripple of consternation in the Armaments Ministry.Z3 strategic situation and thus bound to disappoint.

As chair of the Main Committee from the spring of 1942, Blohm worked closely with Ernst C
