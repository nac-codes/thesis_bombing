xtreme pressure, unevenness in the welding resulted in potentially lethal fractures. The sections could be trusted only after extensive testing and fixing. Altogether, the U-boats, which had taken 175 days to manufacture, required another 120 days of repairs before they could be passed fit for action. Merker’s system, furthermore, required an elaborate administrative apparatus to oversee the flow of sections and subassemblies across the three stages. This was not ready in time. Indeed, in 1944 there was not even a full set of drawings and jigs available for the sub-contractors, meaning that measurements had to be taken from the first submarines being assembled in the dry docks in Hamburg and Bremen. As a result, the final assemblers were never supplied with the smooth flow of prefabricated sections on which Merker’s system depended. Instead, they found themselves having to divert large quantities of labour to tasks which would normally have been put out to sub- contractors. In the short term at least, the well-practised and wide-ranging sub-contracting arrangements already in place for the Mark VII C model yielded far better results than Merker’s radical sec- tional concept. Evolution rather than revolution would almost certainly have brought greater real gains.  It is indicative of the attitude of the Speer Ministry in the last eighteen months of the war that it responded to these well-documented problems, not by reconsidering its plans, but by ever more dictatorial coercion.22 As Karl Otto Saur put it: ‘The path is chosen and will be followed with iron-hard resolution.’23 The result was escalating tension between the Ministry and the shipyards. By May 1944, as the fiasco of the Mark XXI unfolded, Merker and Rudolf Blohm were reduced to accusing one another of self-interested conservatism and incompetence. A month later Merker made personal threats against Blohm, announcing that to rescue the programme he would act ‘without consideration of person or status... and
