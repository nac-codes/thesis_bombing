rogramme and the jet aircraft programme, by contrast, exhibit an ever closer alliance between Albert Speer’s armaments Ministry, Heinrich Himmler’s slave labour system and Germany’s leading industrial firms.  Like the Mark XXI U-boat, the sudden acceleration of the V2 rocket programme in 1943 was clearly a power play by Albert Speer, and the V2 too was a response to failure.

But it is hard to think of any other industry in which relations leadership was searching for a means to respond offensively to British and American bombing. The Luftwaffe had failed to develop its own heavy bomber and even if the He 177 had been a more successful design, German industry lacked the resources to sustain the kind of huge airfleets now being deployed by Britain and the United States. Wernher von Braun’s A4 (V2) rocket, by contrast, promised to give Germany a means of attack against which there was no effective defence. It was, however, a huge technological gamble, and, from the start, it was unclear whether Germany would ever be able to produce enough of the rockets to deliver a truly decisive blow against Britain. Hitler, when the rocket first began to be seriously discussed in the summer of 1942, showed good judgement in dismissing it as a fanciful project.28 However, the A4 rocket, as an army scheme, fell squarely within Speer’s field of responsibility and he therefore had every interest in promoting it as a means
