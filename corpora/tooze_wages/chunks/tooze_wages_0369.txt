In their account, popularized in best-selling biographies and television interviews, it was the meddling of Hitler, Goering and Milch that robbed Galland and his valiant fighter pilots of a weapon with which they might have protected Germany against the merciless onslaught of the bombers. This was a myth that appealed to numerous themes in post-war German political culture: regret at the chance of a victory wasted, the consolation provided by the supposed superiority of ‘German technology’, the self-righteous commemoration of the horror of Allied bombing. But contrary to legend, all the evidence, in fact, suggests that the Reich Air Ministry seized the opportunity of jet power with every possible speed. What prevented the Me 262 from exercising a decisive influence on the air war was not incompetence and conserva- tism, but the debilitating material limitations of the German war economy. As soon as Heinkel tested the first jet-powered prototype in August 1939, both Messerschmitt and Heinkel immediately began developing combat aircraft. Indeed, so actively were these options pursued that they cast a pall of technological uncertainty over the entire piston-engined development programme in the early 1940s. The first designs for the Me 262 were brought to Hitler’s attention in the summer of 1942 and he immediately gave it his enthusiastic backing.12 By the end of May 1943, after further testing, the Air Ministry committed itself definitively to pushing the aircraft BAEDNALLES NS RARE Pe RRR eek system’.
