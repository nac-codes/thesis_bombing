In the effort to get Speer’s rockets and Milch’s jet fighters into mass-production, a brutal cooperation emerged between German industry, the Armaments Ministries and the SS.196 Immediately  Page 617 of 800 76% system’. In the list of dei ex machina with which Hitler might have changed the course of the war, it is amongst the most commonly cited.102 But it is also one of the weapons most surrounded by self- in the summer of 1942 and he immediately gave it his enthusiastic backing.121 By the end of May 1943, after further testing, the Air Ministry committed itself definitively to pushing the aircraft production of the jet.404 The main technical problems, in any case, concerned not the airframe but the engines, the truly revolutionary element of the design. Even if prototypes were being successfully new kind of propulsion system, but doing so whilst economizing on high-performance alloy metals, this is hardly surprising.125 Despite the extraordinary pace of the development work the Junkers- In the effort to get Speer’s rockets and Milch’s jet fighters into mass-production, a brutal cooperation emerged between German industry, the Armaments Ministries and the SS.126 Immediately following the RAF’s highly successful bombing raids on the Peenemuende rocket facility on 18 August 1943, Speer raised the issue of transferring production of the A4 to underground tunnels. To carry out this Herculean construction task, Speer and Hitler quickly agreed that the SS, with its captive workforce of concentration camp inmates, was the obvious contractor. Within days Speer and Saur had settled the terms with Himmler. A suitable underground location was provided by a huge fuel storage facility in Thuringia a
