A suitable underground location was provided by a huge fuel storage facility in Thuringia and the entire project was put on an independent footing with the foundation of the Mittelwerke GmbH. Its board was to consist of General Hans Kammler, the SS construction chief, and two key figures from the Speer apparatus-Degenkolb, of locomotive fame, and Karl Maria Hettlage, Speer’s chief financial expert on secondment from the Commerzbank. The actual operation of the plant was overseen by other veterans of the armaments miracle, including Albin Sawatzki, who had been responsible for Tiger tank production at Henschel during the heady days of the Adolf Hitler Panzer Programme.

Its board was to consist of General Hans Kammler, the SS construction chief, and two key figures from the Speer apparatus—Degenkolb, of locomotive fame, and Luftwaffe that had led the way in the employment of concentration camp labour in armaments production.122 Both Heinkel and Messerschmitt were particularly enterpreneurial in this respect.
