Luftwaffe that had led the way in the employment of concentration camp labour in armaments production.122 Both Heinkel and Messerschmitt were particularly enterpreneurial in this respect. When Milch ordered BMW and Junkers to begin preparations for the mass-production of jet engines at the end of August 1943, he did so on the assumption that they would deploy labour from the Dachau and Oranienburg concentration camps.11° By the end of 1943 it was agreed that Kammler’s tunnels would house production lines for both the V2 and Milch’s Me 262 jet plane. After the war, Speer was asked to explain the three-way working relationship between the SS, the Air Ministry and the Armaments Ministry by a trial judge investigating the Dora concentration camp. Pointing out the fact that Kammler had been simultaneously working for Himmler, Goering and Speer, the judge suggested ‘this must surely have led to collisions’, only for Speer to snap back‘... or to cooperation .. . we tried everything to arrive at close cooperation’.411 Coming from Speer, who was later to construct an entire interpretation of the Third Reich around his supposed life-and-death struggle with the SS, this was a highly significant admission.112 In a construction effort that combined ruthless brutality and speed, Hans Kammler got the Mittelbau tunnel complex into production by the end of the year.113 To honour this remarkable feat, Speer and his staff visited the site on 10 December.114 What they saw left a deep impression. In the dock at Nuremberg, Speer denied ever having seen the true conditions in a concentration camp. But in his memoirs he no longer hid from the horror that he had witnessed at the Mittelbau. To meet the timetable set by Speer’s Armaments Ministry, Kammler had sacrificed the lives of his inmate workforce.115 No time had been wasted in building housing. The labourers slept on site, inside the tunnels, seeing daylight at most once a week, deprived of access to clean water and sanitation.116 The
