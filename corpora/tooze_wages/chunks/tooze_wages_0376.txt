The labourers slept on site, inside the tunnels, seeing daylight at most once a week, deprived of access to clean water and sanitation 116 On 1 January 1944 Degenkolb and Sawatzki delivered the first three rockets, all of which suffered from serious production defects.122 By the end of January, production had risen to 56 units and it topped 400 per month in May. There were still problems with production quality, which resulted in disastrous misfires both on the launching pads and in mid-air, and output was well short of the ambitious target of 1,000 per month. By the summer of 1944 there were also pressing questions about the strategic rationale of the entire programme, which resulted in priority shifting several times between the V2, the smaller and cheaper V1 ‘doodle bug’ and the Me 262 jet plane. But despite all this, under Kammler’s personal supervision, the first Mittelwerke rocket was successfully launched against London on 8 September 1944 and in that month production rose above 600 units, a level that was sustained until February 1945.121 One could hardly ask for more telling testimony to the ambiguities of rationalization discourse in the Third Reich. Other than the atomic bomb, the nightmarish tunnel complex in Thuringia produced the two most futuristic weapons of World War II. The factory itself was clearly regarded as a triumph of the American logic of large scale.122 And it was built in record time by the ruthless but highly effective application of slave labour. Though the top secret project could not be made into the object of armaments propaganda, it was a perfect continuation of Speer’s ‘armaments miracle’. Above all, it was a triumphant vindication of the new alliance between the two strong men of Hitler’s regime—Albert Spee
