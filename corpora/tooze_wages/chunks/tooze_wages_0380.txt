On six consecutive days, thousands of American bombers were hurled against all the major aircraft factories in Germany. The Luftwaffe was not destroyed in a single week. However, the US Army Air Force gave notice that the Germans would now face an utterly unsustainable rate of attrition. In February the Luftwaffe lost one-third of its fighters and a fifth of its crews. In March, it lost more than half its fighter aircraft. In April 43 per cent were shot down and in May and June the loss rate hovered around 50 per cent. Over the first five months of 1944 the Luftwaffe’s entire complement of fighter pilots was either killed or disabled. A few German aces survived long enough to notch up extraordinary tallies but the working life of the average Luftwaffe pilot was now measured in weeks.11 Faced with the imminent extinction of the German air force, the Reich Air Ministry followed the navy in offering to throw in its lot with Speer’s Armaments Ministry. The result was the formation of  Page 623 of 800 76% months, thanks to constant evolution of tactics and technology, the German night fighters were able to keep the upper hand.2 By the end of 1943 the Allied bombers were still not winning the war. For Nor was this lost on the Soviets. On Christmas Eve 1943 they set about breaking the bloody stalemate in the South. Pounding attacks on the Zhitomir—Kiev axis threatened to turn the northern wing the so-called Jaegerstab (Fighter Staff). Nominally, the Jaegerstab was headed by Albert Speer. But in the first weeks of 1944, exhausted by overwork, Speer suffered a physical collapse. Until early May, he was removed from day-to-day business in Berlin. Having ‘surrendered’ the independence of the Air Ministry, Erhard Milch therefore remained effectively in control of Luftwaffe production at least until the summer.12 Now, however, he was able to call on the brutal energies of Karl Otto Saur, a squad of senior officials from Speer’s Ministry, and the particular expertise of SS Gener
