nds of Hungarian Jews for war work was being excitedly discussed in the Fuehrer headquarters.24 The first priority for the allocation of Jewish labour were Kammler’s gigantic underground building sites, but given the emergency facing the Luftwaffe the possibility of employing Jews in aircraft factories was no longer ruled out. Eichmann began the deportation of Hungarian Jewry, at the rate of 12,000-14,000 per day, in mid-May. According to the familiar principle of ‘Selektion’, the majority would be gassed. However, at least a third were expected to be suitable for forced labour in the Reich. Auschwitz was to serve as the ‘collecting camp’ for the incoming transports. Those chosen for work were to be allocated directly to Sauckel, the Todt construction organization, or other high-priority employers, such as the Jaegerstab.25 It is estimated that of the 509,000 Jews eventually deported from Hungary, more than 120,000 survived the war as forced labourers.2 In the Jaegerstab, the employment of Hungarian Jews was discussed first on 26 May 1944, the first meeting attended by the reju- venated Albert Speer. The Jaegerstab was anxious to know what number of Jews they could expect and heard a report from an official who was clearly in regular contact with Auschwitz. With Eich- mann’s transport operation eleven days old, the news from the camp was not good. From the first arrivals, the Armaments Ministry had been offered only ‘children, women, and old men with whom very little can be done’. The best male labour, it seems, was being retained in Hungary, digging tank traps for the Wehrmacht. The minute concluded laconically that: ‘Unless the next transports bring men of an age fit for work, the whole action will not have much success.’22 At this stage in the war nobody can really have been in any doubt about the fate of those Jews who were not considered fit for employment. But that did not concern Speer or the Jaegerstab. A month later the flow of human material was improving
