tself came into existence in February of 1944, the measures it had taken and the resources it had mobilized could not show their full effects before August 1944. A large part of the increase in production up to July 1944 could only be explained in terms of measures taken prior to the formation of the Jaegerstab. Most importantly, the Air Ministry in the course of 1943 had extracted 317,000 workers from Sauckel for the Luftwaffe industries, in addition to 243,000 workers obtained on its own initiative. Amongst this number the Air Ministry claimed ‘credit’ for the extra 100,000 concentration camp inmates supplied by the SS in 1943 and 1944. The Ministry had also set in motion the expansion in aero-engine production, without which the huge surge in aircraft output in 1944 would not have been possible. What rankled most of all, however, was the inconsistent attitude of the Speer Ministry. The essence of Saur’s story was that it was only the ‘lightning-fast response’ of Speer and his staff that had saved the Luftwaffe from immediate disaster in February 1944.31 But this ignored the fact that in the early autumn of 1943, in the immediate aftermath of Hamburg, the Air Ministry had drafted its own plan to bolster Germany’s fighter defences.32 The draft version of the so-called Reichsverteidigungsprogramm (Luftwaffe programme 224) had called for monthly production by July 1944 of no less than 5,390 aircraft, of which two-thirds were to be fighters. A key part of this programme was to be a sharp reduction in the production of older models, in favour of  tha annalaratad mace neadiuctian af tha Ma 969 int fichtar Dist vathar than accicting Milch in tha imnlamantatian af thie erusial nvaductian driv Cnaar had annonived urith Uilly Maccareshmitt ta Hungary, more than 120,000 survived the war as forced labourers.2¢ In the Jaegerstab, the employment of Hungarian Jews was discussed first on 26 May 1944, the first meeting attended by the reju- the accelerated mass-production of the M
