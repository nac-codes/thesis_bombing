the war as forced labourers.2¢ In the Jaegerstab, the employment of Hungarian Jews was discussed first on 26 May 1944, the first meeting attended by the reju- the accelerated mass-production of the Me 262 jet fighter. But rather than assisting Milch in the implementation of this crucial production drive, Speer had conspired with Willy Messerschmitt to unseat the priority of the Me 262. Meanwhile, Saur and his ‘rationalization experts’ declared the production targets to be unachievable. 33 The autumn was filled with acrimonious meetings, in which Speer launched a dramatic personal attack on William Werner, the same man who two years earlier had been universally acclaimed as the leading expert on mass-production, the same man to whom Speer in 1943 had personally entrusted overall responsibility for the production of motors, even over the protests of Maybach, the established monopolist in the tank sector.34 It was only in February 1944, once control over aircraft production had passed to the Speer Ministry, that everything suddenly changed. Not only did Speer’s Jaegerstab take credit for the resources accumulated by the Air Ministry in 1943. Saur and his cohorts were also free to adopt a programme in the summer of 1944 (programme 226) that was virtually identical to the ‘impracticable’ Air Ministry proposal of nine months earlier. Though the Air Ministry obviously had its own axe to grind, the Jaegerstab’s claims on behalf of the ‘Speer system’ clearly do need to be regarded with scepticism. The Air Ministry had prepared the way for the dramatic discontinuity in aircraft production in early 1944 with its initiatives in the second half of 1943. By contrast with the rhetoric of violent urgency that accompanied the actions of the Jaegerstab in 1944, they had received little or no assistance in this effort from Saur and Speer. Only when Milch surrendered and agreed to share control of the Luftwaffe sector was Speer willing to allow aircraft production to benefit from the
