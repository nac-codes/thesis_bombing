On 9 June, immediately following the Allied landings in Normandy, Speer rallied the forces of the Ruhr with a lecture entitled simply ‘The Miracle of Armaments’ (Das Wunder der Ruestung).22 What is clear from the text of the speech, and his subsequent remarks to a handpicked press conference, is that Speer now felt obliged to defend the system of ‘self-responsibility’ that was so central to the entire mythology of his regime.

The evenings were taken up with an uplifting programme of classic
