already been said, the disparity in total output between Germany and its enemies was stark. On the back of the triumphs of the Jaegerstab, Germany in 1944 managed to produce a total of 34,100 combat aircraft. By contrast, the combined output of its major opponents-Britain, the Soviet Union and the United States-came to 127,300 of which the United States accounted for 71,400, a margin of superiority of 3.7 to 1.4 In tanks the disparity was similarly large: 18,300 produced in Germany as opposed to 54,100 by the Allies, with the Soviet Union in this category accounting for 29,000 of the Allied total. The ratios for artillery, rifles and machine guns were somewhat less unfavourable to Germany, varying between 2.1 and 2.7 to 1 against. But 1944 was the peak year for German production, whereas in these categories the output of its enemies reached its maximum in 1943. In short, nothing that Albert Speer and his colleagues had done since 1942 had made any difference to the Wehrmacht’s fundamental predicament. But though on the one hand the triumphalism that surrounds the Speer Ministry clearly needs to be taken with more than a pinch of salt, there is no reason, on the other hand, to talk in terms of failure. Once Germany had engaged both Britain and the Soviet Union and once the United States threw its weight fully into the scales, the odds against the Third Reich were bound to be overwhelming. In 1941, before the German invasion of the Soviet Union but also before the American economy hit full stride, the combined GDP of Britain, the Soviet Union and the United States exceeded that of Germany by a factor of 4.36 to 1. Similarly, in the 1930s the combined steel output of Britain, the Soviet Union and the United States had been almost exactly four times greater than that of Germany and that at a time when American industry was well short of its productive peak.©2 By 1944 the ratio of steel output, even if we add the output of Belgium, France and Poland to the German side, w
