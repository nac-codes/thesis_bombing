In absolute terms, in 1943 all deliveries to the Wehrmacht from occupied Europe came to 4.6 billion Reichsmarks.§8 By contrast, out of American munitions production in 1943 valued at $54.4 billion (c. 150 billion Reichsmarks), Britain received deliveries valued at $6.7 billion (c. 20 billion Reichsmarks).62 Even on very Page 635 of 800 78% PIPL PULSIALICL Y LUE LULAL WAL LULL VOU UE AO JU Ye SAAS A SEALE SD PLU LLU EE RALLIES LW MAYS LALOL TT 22d LEE MAYS PLS LU OU JULY, OPECL LALUS CALIOCU LALLLLOCLE LAL AIALY VV SEES LALe LV 22d0dd WEE WEEE LY PEUVE L1eiii~ under our Fuehrer, stand men like Himmler and Goebbels’ £2 Given Germany’s military situation, the task of the Armaments Staff was, Speer stressed, as much psychological as practical.

In absolute terms, in 1943 all deliveries to the Wehrmacht from occupied Europe came to 4.6 billion Reichsmarks.68 By favourable assumptions about exchange rates, the ratio in the external supply of munitions to the two European powers cannot have been less than 4:1 against Germany.
