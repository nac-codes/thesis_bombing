And as Kehrl’s memo pointed out, even the ‘totally planned economy of Soviet Russia’ had learned the im- portance of retaining a stable monetary standard as a foundation for accounting and statistical measurement.

Not surprisingly, the process of disintegration began on the periphery of the Nazi Empire and
