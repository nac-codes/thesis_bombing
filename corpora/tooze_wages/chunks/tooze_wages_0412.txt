the German war effort was indicative of the fact that by 1944 these crucial thresholds had been breached. Not surprisingly, the process of disintegration began on the periphery of the Nazi Empire and it was worst in the Balkans.23 By the middle of 1942, the price level in Greece had already increased by more than 340 per cent.24 In Romania, a crucial source both of grain and oil, prices had doubled by the autumn of 1942. In Bulgaria and Hungary they had increased by at least 70 per cent. There was similarly rapid inflation in France and Belgium, though they preferred not to publish official price statistics. By 1943 all of Nazi-occupied Western Europe was clearly in the grips of an inflationary wave that brought with it an increasing disorganization and collapse in production. By 1943 Greek national output was half what it had been before the war. Less cruel in its effects but more significant in economic terms was the progressive disintegration of the French economy, where output by 1943 was down by athird on its pre-war level. There was no mystery as to the cause of this monetary collapse. In the French case, German demands may have accounted by 1943 for as much as 50 per cent of national income, a burden impossible to finance either through taxation or sound long-term borrowing.2> As we have seen, as a result of enormous military spending the German economy had been suffering from substantial excess demand at least since 1938. But until 1943 the symptoms of inflationary dysfunction were relatively well controlled. The silent system of war finance instituted in the autumn of 1939 worked well. The tax increases of 1941-2, combined with the ever greater contributions from the occupied territories, permitted the Reich Finance Ministry to finance 54 per cent of expenditure in 1942 and 44 per cent in 1943 out of revenue.76 In 1942 tax revenues were so buoyant that the Reich was actually able to reduce its dependence on borrowing relative to 1941.
