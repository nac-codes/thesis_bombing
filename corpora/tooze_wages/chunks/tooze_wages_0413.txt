Until 1943, furthermore, the flow of household savings was sufficient for at least 17 per cent of total public expend- Page 641 of 800 79% output by 1943 was down by a third on its pre-war level. There was no mystery as to the cause of this monetary collapse. In the French case, German demands may have accounted by 1943 for as much as 50 per cent of national income, a burden impossible to finance either through taxation or sound long-term borrowing. iture to be financed through safe long-term borrowing. This still left between 28 and 33 per cent of expenditure in the budget years 1941, 1942 and 1943 to be covered by short-term borrowing, but the Reichsbank was able to stow away most of this ‘floating debt’ in the money market.

Black marketeering was sanctioned outside Germany, but not within the Reich. Goebbels exploited the winter crisis of 1941-2 to launch a major publicity campaign against illegal market activity, which helped to reinforce public hostility towards profiteers. On one optimistic estimate, the black market accounted for only 2 per cent of consumption expenditure in the early years of the war.ZZ Despite the disastrous setback on the Eastern Front and the huge mobilization of both domestic and foreign resources in which Speer and his colleagues engaged, the stability of the economic order was broadly preserved. Indeed, we should go further than this. Without the largely unacknowledged success of the Reich’s monetary and fiscal authorities in preserving the overall economic balance until the summer of 1943, the triumphs of the Armaments Ministry would have been harder if not impossible to achieve.
