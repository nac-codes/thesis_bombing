nd the occupied territories stagnated at the high point reached in 1942 and, even more worryingly, Germany’s financial institutions were reaching the limit of their ability to absorb state debt. The Gestapo could repress overt expressions of defeatism. But they could not directly control the day-to-day financial decisions of the German population. Already in the aftermath of Stalingrad, Gestapo informants reported an ever greater willingness to resort to the black market.Z2 As households came to rely ever more on such illegal sources there was a corresponding decline in their willingness to inform on them. As in World War I, the war made criminals out of ordinary, law-abiding householders. Over the course of the war, more than a hundred thousand prosecutions for breach of the war-economy regulations were brought before the courts. According to one independent estimate, the black market by the end of the war accounted for at least 10 per cent of household consumption. As cash increasingly flooded into illegal channels, the system for recycling excess purchasing power broke down. Pre- cisely at the moment in the early summer of 1943 when Speer’s armaments miracle first ground to a halt, savings deposits fell sharply for the first time since the early months of the war.80 By the summer of 1944 a total monetary collapse was under way. The sale of long-term investment products such as life insurance had fallen off sharply already in the spring and large cash withdrawals were reported from banks across the country. The financial institutions, for their part, increasingly turned away from either long- or short-term government bonds, forcing the Reichsbank to absorb ever larger quantities of government paper into its accounts. Cash in circulation ballooned. Between September 1944 and the end of April 1945 the volume of banknotes expanded by more than 80 per cent.81 Germany now faced the imminent threat of hyperinflation. This in turn undermined the functioning of the ‘real
