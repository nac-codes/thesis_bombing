As far as possible, they also began to export capital from Germany, to safe havens in Sweden, Switzerland and Portugal.82 From the point of view of the Speer Ministry, however, this ‘drive to substance’ (‘Drang zur Substanz’) was deeply dysfunctional. It ran directly contrary to the desire of the planners to cut down on the hoarding of stocks and to prevent firms from placing orders for new plant that could not possibly make any contribution to the immediate war effort. By 1944, every Reichsmark invested in new machine tools or new buildings distracted resources away from the immediate production of armaments.83  It was only, therefore, in the summer of 1944 that the Speer Ministry was finally forced to consider the wider economic consequences of its relentless production drive.
