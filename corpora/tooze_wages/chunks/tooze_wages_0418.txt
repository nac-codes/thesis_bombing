bined with an equally determined effort to restore the functioning of the monetary system. Kehrl’s staff thus called for a sharp increase in taxes on consumer expenditure and a system of forced saving whereby armaments contractors and workers would be paid a fraction of their income, not in cash, but in the form of government bonds, which would be redeemable only after the war was over.  As we have seen, the idea of creaming off the profits earned in the armaments sector had been discussed repeatedly since the start of the war, but not until the summer of 1944 did it finally gain the backing of the managers of the armaments effort. In 1943 the Finance Ministry had proposed a set of measures that would have raised an additional 8 billion Reichsmarks per annum.82 However, the dangers involved in any large increase in taxation were apparent from the experience in the summer of 1942, when the German banking system was swept by rumours that the Reich was about to impose a punitive tax on savings. The savings banks, a crucial link in the conveyor belt of ‘silent financing’, were unsettled by a series of panic withdrawals. Unsurprisingly, the proposed package of tax increases was vetoed by Hitler and the party authorities in early 1943, and the Academy for German Law, which had provided the main forum for academic discussion of the Reich’s fiscal problems, shut down the relevant committee.86 On 22 September 1944 Hitler again vetoed any further discussion of major tax increases. In February 1945, as the money supply surged out of control, the Finance Ministry made one last desperate appeal to siphon off at least 25 billion Reichsmarks.82 As the Third Reich collapsed, a bewildered and out-of-touch Fuehrer was finally persuaded to put his signature to a tax decree. He did so, however, on the condition that the tax increases should come into force only after the end of the war.
