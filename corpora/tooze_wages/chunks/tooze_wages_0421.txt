t would be the Wehrmacht or the German war economy that collapsed first. The losses of territory suffered from the beginning of 1944 signed the death warrant of the war economy. The evacuation of the Ukrainian ore mines in February 1944 restricted German steel production to a time-horizon of eighteen months at most.82 The supply of oil from Romania-an absolute precondition  Page 645 of 800 79% fldappy tO s€e€ VOUT) Proaucers alla WOLTKELS Well TOWal Ged if tiflaliCidal Leriis LOL tileit ever Ere€ater COMLIDULION LO Wal PrOauUcuiOlrl. it Was OLY Wilerl Cie CisiitlesratiOll OF ile MlOMetaLy systeril DeEall LO for the continuation of large-scale mobile warfare-was cut off by April 1944. These losses put a time limit on German survival. But they did not by themselves imply immediate collapse. In a typically bullish assessment prepared for Hitler in the first week of September 1944, Speer reckoned that German stocks of raw materials were sufficient to allow production to continue, even if Germany was forced to retreat altogether from the Balkans, Western Europe, northern Italy and halfway across Hungary.22 It was not territorial losses that paralysed the German economy but the onset of a cam- paign of aerial bombardment, of completely unprecedented intensity.21  In the first half of 1944 the British and American air forces had been distracted by the preparations for the invasion of Normandy. The Allies left nothing to chance. To protect the beachheads from rapid German counterattack they methodically pulverized the entire French transport system. The only significant diversions from this tactical bombing were a series of devastating attacks on Ger- many’s fuel hydrogenation plants. Once Normandy was secured, the bombers were finally free to turn their full attention to Germany, and they did so with dreadful intensity. It had taken four long and painful years since the fateful decisions in the summer of 1940 to construct the Anglo-American air weapon. But the war-winning
