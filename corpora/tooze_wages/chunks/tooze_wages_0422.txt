ny, and they did so with dreadful intensity. It had taken four long and painful years since the fateful decisions in the summer of 1940 to construct the Anglo-American air weapon. But the war-winning airfleet was now ready. In March 1943, at the start of the strategic bombing campaign, the British and Americans had disposed of 1,000 aircraft with a combined bomb-lifting capacity of 4,000 tons.22 By February 1944, in time for the all-out offensive of Big Week, the combined force had swollen to 3,000 bombers and was increasing rapidly to reach 5,250 by July 1944, the level at which it stabilized for the rest of the war. Five times as many aircraft as in 1943 were now capable of delivering a staggering 20,000 tons of bombs in a single lift. And from June 1944 onwards this fearful weapon was turned relentlessly against the Reich. Between June and October 1944 the British and Americans rained down on Germany no less than half a million tons of bombs, more than in the entire war up to that point. Over the next six months they dropped a further 545,000 tons. Berlin and the Ruhr were visited with raids of unprecedented intensity. The 8th US Army Air Force hit Berlin on 3 February 1945 with a force of 1,000 heavy bombers, a raid which claimed 2,893 lives. But it was not just the big cities that were now being targeted. Dozens of smaller towns were laid waste by fire and explosives: Darmstadt on 12 September 1944 (8,400 dead), Freiburg on 27/28 November (2,000 dead), Heilbronn on 4 December (7,000 dead), Nuremberg on 2 January 1945 (1,790 dead) and again on 20 and 21 February, Magdeburg on 16 January 1945 (4,000 dead), Dresden on 13/14 February (35,000 dead), Wuerzburg on 16/ 17 February (5,000 dead), Pforzheim on 23/24 February (17,000 dead) and Swinemiinde on 12 March (5,000 dead). The RAFâ€™s last major night-time raid was against Potsdam on 14/15 April 1945, a sortie by 500 bombers which killed at least 3,500 people and incinerated the historical records of the Prussian arm
