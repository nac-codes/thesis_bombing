The RAF’s last major night-time raid was against Potsdam on 14/15 April 1945, a sortie by 500 bombers which killed at least 3,500 people and incinerated the historical records of the Prussian army.23 Ina general sense, this destruction clearly contributed to the dislocation of the German home front. It also clearly satisfied a heartfelt desire for revenge. The heaviest month of bombing in the entire war was March 1945, with a total payload of 133,329 tons, at a time when such raids could have no conceivable impact, even in accelerating the end of the fighting. Not that the devastating bombard- ment did not have serious economic effects. Factories were obliterated, burned out, buried in mountains of rubble, or paralysed for lack of raw materials and power. But the correlation between the area bombing of Germany’s cities and the collapse of its war production was loose, at best. There was probably no single plant to which the Allies devoted more attention than Krupp’s Gusstahlfabrik in Essen, the ultimate symbol of German industrial militarism. 24 By the end of the war, the Gusstahlfabrik had been targeted no less than twenty-five times. In 1943 it was repeatedly bombed as part of the ‘Battle of the Ruhr’. But steel production was not definitively ended until 23-5 October 1944, when Essen was attacked by a total of 1,200 planes.
