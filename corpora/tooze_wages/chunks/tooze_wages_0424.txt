The heaviest attack of all, however, came on 11 March 1945, by which time the bombers were doing little more than ploughing a field of rubble. The wanton destruction of German cities could disrupt production, but it could not bring it to a complete standstill. The way in which the bombers achieved that effect was by severing the rail links and waterways between the Ruhr and the rest of Germany. The disaster began at the end of September with an attack by RAF Bomber Command which drained the Dortmund-Ems canal.2Â° The giant marshalling yard at Hamm was hit repeatedly in September and October, reducing its capacity by 75 per cent. The Rhine was blocked on 14 October by the destruction of the Cologne-Muelheim bridge. Between 14 and 18 October rail shipments of coal from the Ruhr were halted completely, and the disruption in the reverse direction was even more severe. In early October only one of fifty ore trains was making it into the Ruhr. For lack of iron ore, steel production in the Ruhr by January 1945 was down by 66 per cent relative to the previous year. Though Allied bombing strategy actually shifted in November and December away from the absolute prioritization of transport targets, the sheer weight of tonnage dropped was sufficient to bring about near total collapse. Between November 1944 and January 1945 the British and American air forces delivered no less than 102,796 tons against transport targets, mainly railway marshalling yards. On 11 November Speer reported to Hitler that the Ruhr was effectively sealed off from the rest of the Reich.26 The shortfall in hard coal deliveries from the Ruhr between August 1944 and January 1945 was a massive 36.5 million tons, at least six weeks of normal consumption. In December 1944 Germany faced the first of three consecutive winters without adequ
