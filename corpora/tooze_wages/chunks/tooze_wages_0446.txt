In that book, dictated in a prison cell in Landsberg fifteen years earlier, Hitler had called for an Anglo-German alliance against the Tidaen-Ralshevik threat. In 1939 he went ta war with fronts reversed: in alliance with Stalin against Rritain. This. however is simnlistic. The kev tn Hitler’s ideolasv was not a  Page 660 of 800 81% alliance against the Judaeo-Bolshevik threat. In 1939 he went to war with fronts reversed: in alliance with Stalin against Britain.
