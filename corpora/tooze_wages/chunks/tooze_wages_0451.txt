justice to the scale of the Anglo-American effort from as early as the summer of 1940. In this respect, the truly vast discrepancy between Anglo-American aircraft procurement and Germany’s relatively insignificant outsour- cing to France and the Netherlands is very telling. It was an imbalance that was not lost on Goering and the German Air Ministry.  Giving due weight to the trans-Atlantic arms race in German calculations in 1940-41 also helps us to explain another conundrum which has continued to preoccupy students of the Nazi regime and which seriously influences the way in which we write its history. Contrary to the claims of some authors, the Ostheer of 1941 was considerably more powerful than that which invaded France. But it is equally undeniable that it was a force carefully calibrated on the assumption that the Red Army could be destroyed in a short campaign. German planning provided for no margin of error. Even ona charitable reading, therefore, the Barbarossa campaign was surrounded by enormous risks. It appears irrational and foolhardy when this evidence of minimal mobilization is combined with the most widely cited industrial statistics, which appear to show stagnation in armaments output and a catastrophic collapse in labour productivity between 1940 and 1941. In the light of this data, it would seem that complacency and inefficiency following the victory over France, combined with racist condescension towards the Soviets, prevented the Wehrmacht from maximizing its chances in what was Clearly the decisive campaign of the war. If this were true, this moment of ‘failure’ should clearly stand at the centre of our entire interpretation of Hitler’s regime. However, once we consider the to launch his strike against Poland and then against the Western coalition that continued was clearly the decisive campaign of the war. If this were true, this moment of ‘failure’ should clearly stand at the centre of our entire interpretation of Hitler’s regime. However, o
