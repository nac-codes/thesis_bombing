orce, using primary, multiarchival sources as well as a host of studies by authors whom I have credited in the Source Notes. Over the years I have received considerable assistance from archivists at various locations. At the Air Force Historical Research Agency, Joe Caver, Archie Difante, Jerome Ennels, Dan Haulman, Forrest Marion, and Anne O'Connor were critical. Bill Elliott at the Air Force Materiel Command and Doug Lantry and Brett Stolle at the National Museum of the United States Air Force were also important. I also wish to thank Tim Nenninger at the National Archives, Tom Lubbesmeyer and Mike Lombardi at Boeing, and Alan Renga at the San Diego Air and Space Museum for their help. The reference librarians at the Air University and Radford University, especially Bud Bennett, interlibrary loan librarian at Radford, proved essential through the years. A number of individuals at the Naval Institute Press deserve credit for encouraging and making this project possible, including Mark Gatlin, Rick Russell, Janis Jorgensen, and especially copy editor Karin Kaufman. A special debt of gratitude is due the history faculty at Duke University, who taught, encouraged, and men- tored me. Of that noble band, Theodore Ropp was my major advisor, and Irving B. Holley my continuing inspiration. Pride of place, of course, goes to my wife, Jeanne. lx  caps lock VOVDIDA ABBREVIATIONS AAA Antiaircraft artillery (flak) AAF Army Air Forces ABM Antiballistic missile ACM Advanced cruise missile ACTS Air Corps Tactical School AFCE Automatic flight control equipment ALCM Air-launched cruise missile AMSA Advanced manned strategic aircraft ASM Air-to-surface missile ATA Advanced tactical aircraft ATB Advanced technology bomber ATRAN Automatic terrain recognition and navigation AWPD Air War Plans Division BMD Ballistic missile defense BMEWS Ballistic missile early warning system BSAX Battlefield surveillance aircraft CBO CCS CEP DEW ECM EVS FAS GAF GAM GCI GD GLCM GPS ICBM Intercontinental
