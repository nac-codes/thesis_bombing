Its story is a tale of high hopes and great efforts, along with consider- able costs. But there is also a dark side to this subject, linked with death and destruction and the well-founded belief that strategic bombardment has the potential to end civili- zation as we know it. And while the end of the Cold War has dampened many of these fears, the proliferation of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems has mutated and heightened concerns. There is growing apprehension that the new nuclear-armed nations may not be as responsible as the older ones and may not adhere to the established rules of the nuclear powers. This fear for the future, coupled with strategic bombing's record against civilians, has branded aerial bombardment as a weapon and symbol of barbarism. The Promise Homeland targets have been considered much more vulnerable than fielded military forces, and attacking them, rather than the enemy's military, has been likened to a stiletto to the heart instead of an axe to the limbs. Air power advocates and theorists forecasted, if not promised, that this new form of warfare would be cheap, quick, and decisive compared to traditional means of warfare. But to achieve its potential, strategic bombardment had to overcome a number of obstacles. These included the requirements of range, accuracy, bomb load, target intelligence, and the ability to counter poor weather and enemy defenses. The power of strategic bombardment
