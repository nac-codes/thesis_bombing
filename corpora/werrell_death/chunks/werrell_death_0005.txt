fective and widespread use of air power, but only the Americans and British employed strategic bombardment on a grand scale. This bombing was hampered by problems associated with weather, accuracy, intelligence, enemy defenses, the flexibility and resilience of enemy economies, the stoicism of the population, and the resolve of the enemy's leadership. It involved considerable effort and cost to both attackers and the attacked and left an ongoing controversy as to its efficacy and morality. To this day two questions remain: Was World War II a fair test of the concept and how effective was strategic bombardment in the war? At the time the conflict appeared to validate the advocates of air power and support the views of strategic bombardment enthusiasts now armed with nuclear weapons. World War II reordered the world balance of power and helped lead to the bipolar world and the Cold War, which pitted the American-led "free world" coalition against the Soviet-led Communist coalition in a rivalry that dominated world events for the next four decades. Both sides fielded large numbers of strategic bombardment systems that could deliver nuclear weapons. The adversaries first deployed bombers, and then, beginning in the late 1950s, technological advances changed the shape of air warfare and strategic bombardment. In short order ballistic missiles were considered superior to bombers for both the nuclear deterrent and nuclear war-fighting roles. Cruise missiles first aided then threatened to replace the pen- etrating bomber. Meanwhile bombers also were challenged by surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and smaller aircraft. Since World War II air power (perhaps more accurately, aircraft and some missiles) has been commonly employed in large and small wars by major and minor powers. At the same time strategic bombardment has seen only limited action and nuclear weapons have not again been employed. The smaller powers could not afford it, while the major powers could not use it fully
