he same time strategic bombardment has seen only limited action and nuclear weapons have not again been employed. The smaller powers could not afford it, while the major powers could not use it fully because of political constraints and limited strategic targets. Although strategic xv bombardment was greatly enhanced by improving technologies, it was unable to achieve victory by itself. Was this because of a flawed concept or the politi- cal restraints? This Book Some definitions are in order to clarify the discussion that follows. First, I use the term "air power" to include all uses of air vehicles as well as missiles and space vehicles instead of the more precise but awkward "air and space power." Second, I use the term "strategic bombardment," a subset of this construction, to encompass both strategic bombing (aircraft) and strategic missiles (both air- breathing cruise and rocket-powered ballistic missiles). Strategic bombardment is perhaps best understood for what it is not. It is neither tactical operations, the attack of enemy troops (close air support), nor interdiction, the attack of enemy supplies that sustain the troops. Instead, strategic bombardment strikes the enemy's homeland, bypasses its armed forces, and directly hits the source of its power, be it physical targets, such as war industry (munitions' plants, for example), economic targets (fuel, transportation, or electricity), or psychological targets (the enemy's civilian morale). What follows is the story of strategic bombardment from its inception through its development to the present. This study centers on the technology and employment of strategic bombardment. Doctrine, another important element, is mentioned, but it occupies a lesser role, as it merits. Bombers, U.S. efforts, and World War II dominate the narrative, as their significance deserves and demands. Coverage of U.S. aspects is based mainly on primary sources, with the exception of World War I, while coverage of non-U.S. aspects is
