He modified his early design to a more practi- cal cigar-shaped gas bag braced by a rigid structure with an under-slung gondola for (Right) In January 1915 the Germans initiated the first strategic bombing campaign employing zeppelins against Britain. Weather, engine unreliability, and highly flammable hydrogen were great hazards, and half of the zeppelins built were lost. The L-12 was hit by antiaircraft artillery on its maiden flight in August 1915 and went down in the English Channel. Note the aircrew on both gondolas and on the top surface.

It was scrapped in 1901 after two more flights and a total flying time of just over two hours because it exhibited inadequate control, low speed, and a weak hull. Zeppelin built and flew other airships that led the German War Ministry to purchase two, but they did not do well in competition against short-range, nonrigid, lighter-than-air craft. The count then formed the world's first commercial airline, which carried almost thirty-three thousand passengers on sixteen hundred flights before the war broke out. Thus the name "zeppe- lin" and the craft's concept became known throughout the country, the Continent, and the world and became a point of pride for Germans. The German navy also showed an interest in airships. The navy's chief, Gross Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, saw its promise as a scouting vehicle equipped with radios as early as 1906 but wanted a craft with longer range and greater speed (to buck the North Sea winds) than what Zeppelin was able to deliver. However, pressure from the kaiser and the public, along with the threat that the airship maker might sell airships to Britain, forced the German navy to order their first machine in April 1912, which initially flew that October.  caps lock ER THE EARLY
