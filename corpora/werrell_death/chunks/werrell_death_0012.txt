transmissions from two ground stations to allow an airship's crew to ascertain its position. Despite great expectations the airships' combat record was disappointing. Dur- ing the opening months of the war the army lost half of its machines to ground fire. Concurrently German airmen began making long-range attacks, starting with a raid on Antwerp in early September 1914. Although both the German public and military wanted to bomb London, the kaiser was reluctant, possibly concerned about neutral opinion and perhaps fearful of hitting his royal relatives. There is no indica- tion that the Germans gave any attention to the international treaties that banned the bombing of cities. The kaiser vacillated, but after the French bombed Freiburg in Janu- ary 1915, he authorized attacks on London with certain geographic and target restric- tions. After an abortive effort, on January 19, 1915, three naval airships dropped a ton of bombs over eastern Britain, killing four and injuring sixteen. It was not until the last day of May 1915 that an army airship attacked London, dropping three thousand pounds A second difficulty was the weather. Poor weather and zeppelin operations were a dangerous mix. The airships were unwieldy under the best of circumstances and difficult to handle in high winds and turbulence. As most only had a top speed in the range of sixty miles per hour, they had marginal speed when flying in high winds.3 The air- ship's large structure was also vulnerable to the stresses of turbulent weather. A third problem was the unreliability of the zeppelin's power plants. Airships had multiple engines that were accessible to the crew in flight, a wise provision because the engines frequently broke down. Engine fail- ure in calm air was not critical, but against 5 high winds it certainly could be. The airships were underpowered when all engines were running at peak performance and certainly had problems when any failed or were not producing full power. horns from a pho
