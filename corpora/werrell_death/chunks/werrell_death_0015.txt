man priorities are clearly seen in their decision to remove parachutes that had been carried for a brief time in 1917, saving about eighteen pounds per man. The manufacturer tightly doped the outer cover of the craft to reduce drag, reduced the weight of the gas cells by using two layers of silk rather than three layers of cotton fabric. These measures reduced weight and, depending on the particular airship, allowed operations up to eighteen thousand feet. In practice, however, the zeppelins cruised at lower altitudes to aid navigation and increase bombing accuracy. Lighter construction in the succeeding airships (spacing the largest frames farther apart), and new, streamlined gondolas, which were retrofitted into the fleet, further increased performance. New airships could reach almost twenty thousand feet. Ostend, it was written off. That same morn- ing airship gunners shot down a British interceptor, the only such recorded success by a zeppelin. The British-based airmen achieved their first aerial kill in Septem- ber 1916, when a fighter, using incendiary ammunition for the first time, destroyed an airship. This came during the largest and only joint German zeppelin raid of the war, an attack consisting of dozen naval craft and four army machines. This armada dropped seventeen tons of bombs but inflicted little damage or injury on the British. The one downed airship cost four times as much as the damage inflicted during this raid, while the sixteen crewmembers killed were four times the number of civilians killed. This was the last army airship raid of England, for in June 1917 the army pulled the zep- pelins back to Germany and that summer broke up all but two "super Zeppelins" that it turned over to the navy. Meanwhile, the German navy persisted. The Germans constantly attempted to improve their airships throughout the war. In May 1916 the first of a new type arrived for service against Britain. Powered by six rather than five engines, they were more powerful,
