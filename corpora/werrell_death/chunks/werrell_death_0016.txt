ntly attempted to improve their airships throughout the war. In May 1916 the first of a new type arrived for service against Britain. Powered by six rather than five engines, they were more powerful, more streamlined, better protected (by as many as ten machine guns), and could carry five tons of bombs. Nevertheless these were little faster and flew at about the same altitude as their predecessors.6 In late November 1916 British aircraft downed two zeppelins. As a consequence the head of the naval airship detachment wrote, "Machine guns are no defence for the airship against aeroplanes ... [therefore] 'attack only with cloud cover.'"7 The navy concluded that the best defense against interceptors was Higher altitude operations introduced new problems. They subjected the crew to both the cold and anoxia, and while the air- ships carried compressed oxygen, they did not carry heating devices. Higher altitude operations made navigation more difficult; caused engine problems; froze instruments, water ballast, and lubricants; shattered cellu- loid windows; made the craft's fabric brittle; and caused control cables to stick. Never- theless the increased altitude could render the defending craft impotent as fighters used through 1917 had ceilings below thir- teen thousand feet. Not until the end of the war did the British field fighters that could reach these higher operating altitudes.8 (Right) The Germans began using Gotha bombers in May 1917 to bombard Britain. Although carrying a lighter bomb load than the airships, they were faster and, flying in formations, better able to defend themselves However, British defenses inflicted heavy losses on the Germans, forcing them to turn to night operations. (National Museum of the USAF) The new "Height Climbers" made their first attack in March 1917, during which one airship was lost. The attacks persisted with limited bombing results and continued casualties. On October 19, 1917, the Ger- mans launched eleven airships on the last
