in March 1917, during which one airship was lost. The attacks persisted with limited bombing results and continued casualties. On October 19, 1917, the Ger- mans launched eleven airships on the last great airship raid of the war. Although none of the seventy-three British pilots launched that night made contact with the intruders, the raid proved to be a great disaster. Despite a favorable weather forecast, the zeppelins ran into a gale that along with mechanical breakdowns and French antiaircraft fire con- tributed to the loss of five of the giant craft. Nevertheless the attacks continued. On August 5, 1918, the Germans launched their first attack on Britain in four months; it consisted of five airships led by the commander of the naval air division in an airship that had first flown only a month earlier. The defenders got thirteen fighters up and in clear weather downed the lead airship. One British aircraft was lost to unknown causes; at least two others were 7 Go.GI 203 16 Go.Gs 205 lost in forced landings. Within a week a British fighter downed another airship over the North Sea. These zeppelin losses, but especially the death of their leader, marked the end of the airship as a bomber. German Strategic Bomber Operations Fixed-wing aircraft joined zeppelins in the assault on Britain during the last two years of the war. The bombers raised Germans hopes, although it took six bombers to deliver as much tonnage as one zeppelin. The com- mander of the German air force proposed thirty Gotha G.IV bombers for these attacks, to be joined later by a second squadron consisting of the even larger R-type Giant bombers.9 The Germans deployed the new models to Ghent, about 170 miles from London, the first arriving in March 1917. In the words of General Erich Ludendorff, the "purpose [of the bombing] was to shat- ter the unity of the enemy and dispel their belief in victory"10 Secondary objectives  CHAPTER 1 8 THE EARLY YEARS THROUGH WORLD WAR I withdrawal one Bristol fighter
