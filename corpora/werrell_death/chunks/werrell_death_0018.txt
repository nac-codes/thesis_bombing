The bombers had attacked the British Empire's capital in broad daylight without a loss, killing 162 and injuring 432. Due to improved bombs and accuracy, this raid inflicted greater dam- age than any zeppelin attack. were to disrupt British industrial produc- tion and communications between the ports and London, destroy supply facilities at the ports, and dislocate transportation across the channel. London would be the focus of these attacks. The task of the "England Squad- ron" was a tall order for a handful of aircraft embarking on a new form of warfare. Two engines powered the Gotha G.IVs, which had a cruising speed of eighty miles per hour. They usually carried a bomb load of 660 pounds during the day (flying lower at night, the load increased to 1,100 pounds), were armed with two or three machine guns, and were manned by a crew of three. One innovation that increased their defen- sive capabilities was to cut away a portion of the rear deck, allowing a gunner to fire downward and to the rear of the bomber. Although the Gotha was considered agile in flight, it was tricky to fly and land at light weights, accounting for many landing accidents. For this strategic campaign the Germans fitted the bomber with primi- tive oxygen equipment and extra fuel tanks, which provided an additional two hours of flying time. These aircraft did not carry heat- ing devices, parachutes, or radios. However, despite the skepticism of the crews, they did carry carrier pigeons in the event the crew went down at sea. 9 In late May 1917 the Gothas made their first attempt to raid London, but the mission was aborted when the
