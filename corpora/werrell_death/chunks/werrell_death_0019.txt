ticism of the crews, they did carry carrier pigeons in the event the crew went down at sea. 9 In late May 1917 the Gothas made their first attempt to raid London, but the mission was aborted when the Gothas encountered storms; instead, they bombed the coastal town of Folkestone, killing 95 and injuring another 260, the highest losses yet inflicted by an air attack. In mid-June, six of twenty Gothas reached central London without encountering British fighters. On their The Gothas proved much more dif- ficult than the zeppelins to counter because they were faster and better able to defend themselves in formations that massed their firepower. While the British could get one hundred or more aircraft aloft in defense, these were a wide mixture (the Royal Flying Corps flew twenty-one different types) of obsolete aircraft that were outmatched by the Gothas. The bulk of the German losses occurred from accidents or lack of fuel. To respond to the threat, the British shifted a few fighter units from France, equipped other units with more mod- ern aircraft, and increased the number of antiaircraft guns. On a mid-August raid 11 German bombers crossed the coast, inflicted little damage, but lost 1 bomber to 133 British fighters and 4 others in crash landings, a high toll. As with the airships, weather could also cause great problems in the aircraft operations. On August 11, 1917, twenty-eight Gothas launched against Britain encountered stiff winds that reduced their ground speed to fifty miles per hour. Thirteen bombers were destroyed. Four days later the German Gothas made their last daylight attack on Britain. Eleven of the fifteen that took off made it to England, but only to coastal targets. One was lost to antiaircraft fire and two to fighters. In response to these substantial losses, in September the Gothas turned to night operations. One British reaction to the bomber attacks was to deploy barrage balloons in the fall of 1917, a device already employed by the Germans and
