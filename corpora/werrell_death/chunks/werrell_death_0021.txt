entrated weight near the center of gravity, allowing good flight characteristics, but this was counterbalanced by the increased complexity, greater weight, and the loss of power absorbed by the trans- mission system. The decentralized engine placement proved lighter and more reliable. The Germans built between fifty-five and sixty-five R-planes, of which about thirty saw action. The Staaken R.IV was the first of these that engaged in combat in the west. It was powered by six engines, two geared to a trac- tor prop in the nose and two in each nacelle geared to a pusher prop, and carried seven machine guns. It first flew in August 1916 and saw service on the eastern front before deploying to Belgium in August-September 1917 for operations against Britain. The R.V had five engines, four in two nacelles, and one in the nose, which turned three tractor props. Unlike the R.IV, the engine transmis- sions caused numerous problems. The R. V was accepted in September 1917, flew with a crew of eleven, and had a higher top speed and ceiling than the R.IV. The R. VI was the largest aircraft to be produced in numbers during the war. The first was completed late in 1916, and after testing it was delivered to the air arm in June 1917. This aircraft dispensed with the coupled engine arrangement and mounted four engines tractor-pusher fashion turning four props in two nacelles. Two pilots sat  CHAPTER 1 THE EARLY YEARS THROUGH WORLD WAR I The German R.VI could carry more than two tons of bombs and truly lived up to its nickname (Giant) with a wing span only slightly less than that of the largest World War Il bomber, the B-29. It flew almost a tenth of the German bomber sorties against Britain, on which it suffered no combat losses.
