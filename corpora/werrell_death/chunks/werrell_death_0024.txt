rship sorties that dropped thirty-three tons of bombs that killed 270 Parisians. The French deployed about nine hundred guns and forty thou- sand men to defend their capital.11 German aircraft operations against Britain in World War I were modest by later standards. The Gothas completed 292 sorties and dropped ninety-three tons of bombs, while the R-planes, for all the attention they received, completed a mere 28 sorties and dropped only thirty tons of bombs. The Giants carried a much greater bomb load, proved more reliable, and had a lower loss rate than the Gothas. The Germans lost sixty Gothas, the bulk destroyed in crashes in Belgium (thirty-six), with British fighters claiming eight and guns twelve. British home defenses did not get any of the R-planes, although two were destroyed in crash landings in Belgium. The German bombers killed 860 Britons and injured 2,100. In comparison the airships delivered 220 tons of bombs on two hundred sor- ties that killed 560 and wounded 1,400. (London antiaircraft guns accounted for 24 of the dead and nearly 200 of the injured.) The aerial bombardment caused $15 million in property damage, about equally credited to bombers and airships. The Germans losses, excluding those at their bases, totaled 160 airship and sixty Gotha crewmembers; the British lost twenty-eight airmen in the defensive effort. Allied Strategic Air Attacks The Allies also engaged in strategic bombing, albeit to a lesser degree than the Germans. This was a result of a number of factors, but certainly not of restraint. One reason was geography. London and Paris were closer to German bases than Berlin was to Anglo-French bases. The Germans also had zeppelins and more sophisticated, longer- range bombers sooner than did either the British or the French. Other factors were the desperate need for Allied air power on the western front and the objections of both the British army and navy to independent strategic bombing.
