rs were the desperate need for Allied air power on the western front and the objections of both the British army and navy to independent strategic bombing. In fact, Hugh Trenchard, best remembered as the father of the Royal Air Force (RAF) and as a strategic air power advocate, early on characterized strategic bombing operations as a "great waste." Nevertheless the British pushed this effort in response to public and political pressure. The French, much closer to German bases and with a less well defended capital, were more reluctant to take this course of action. The Royal Navy took the lead in stra- tegic bombing. While at first glance this seems odd, it made sense at the time because the British army was tied down in the trenches on the western front, there was no independent air force, and the Royal Navy had been assigned the task of home defense. In April 1916 the Admiralty's director of At its peak British home defenses con- sisted of over seventeen thousand personnel, 470 antiaircraft guns, 620 searchlights, and up to 380 aircraft.

Such an effort would restore the initiative to the British, restrict zeppelin operations, divert German forces from the western front, and batter German morale. The British were not the only ones thinking in these terms, for the next month the French proposed a combined bomb- ing effort under French control and from a French base against German industrial targets.
