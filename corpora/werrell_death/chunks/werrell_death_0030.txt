rveys and German officials led one histo- rian to conclude that "material results were incommensurate with the effort" and at best disappointing.13 The attacks on railroads, consisting of 33 percent of the tonnage, proved no better. The overall cost during this period was twelve aircraft destroyed, eight pilots killed, and ten other crewmem- bers missing in action.

While he ostensibly planned to hit industrial targets, his bombers primarily bombed tacti- cal targets, with airfield attacks rising from 13 percent in June 1918 to 50 percent in August. At the same time railroads were the targets of 55 percent of the effort in June and 31 percent in August. 17 In February 1918 the 41st Wing was redesignated Eighth Brigade, which in June 1918 became the core of the Indepen- dent Force (IF), sometimes referred to as the Independent Air Force. Trenchard took command despite his objections and reservations concerning strategic bombing, for he was Britain's leading airman and was highly thought of by both the Americans and French. The purpose was "direct action against the heart of the German indus- trial system."16 This strategic force grew in numbers and capability during the year, and by September the British were field- ing nine bombing squadrons, four flying DH-4/9/9As in daylight operations and five flying Handley Page O/100s in night opera- tions. One step backward was the introduc- tion of the DH-9, which was "generally unsatisfactory-and unwanted."17 Although it looked like the famous DH-4, its ceiling and cruising speeds were inferior and its engine inadequate and unreliable. The main change was to
