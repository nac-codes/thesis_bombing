was "generally unsatisfactory-and unwanted."17 Although it looked like the famous DH-4, its ceiling and cruising speeds were inferior and its engine inadequate and unreliable. The main change was to move the fuel tank from between the pilot and observer forward of the pilot. The next version, the DH-9A, featured a larger wing and a more powerful engine. The increased power gave the newer aircraft about equivalent performance with the DH-4. Handley Page provided the backbone of the IF's bombers. The first of these, the O/100, had been designed for sea patrol duty in response to a December 1914 Royal Navy specification. The aircraft was manned by a crew of three and featured an enclosed bomb bay that could carry a maximum of two thousand pounds, which was three times that of the Short bomber and six times that of the DH-4, Britain's other bombers of the day. It also had three gun positions that mounted up to five machine guns. Initially the manufacturer armored both the nacelles and crew cabin, however, it later deleted the nacelle armor and enclosed cabin. The oper- ational O/100 had a span one hundred feet (from which the designation was derived) and wings that folded back, outboard of the engine nacelles that housed two 250- hp (later 285-hp) engines. Handley Page built forty-six O/100s, the first making its maiden flight in December 1915. In one of those awkward twists of history, the pilot of one of these bombers became lost in the fog on a delivery flight in January 1917, prior to its first bombing mission in March, landed behind German lines, and was captured in his brand new bomber. Pilots considered the O/100 a pleasant aircraft to fly, although it was heavy on the controls and slow to respond. The manufacturer modified the aircraft by moving the fuel tanks from the nacelles into the fuselage, substituting props rotating in the same direction for opposite rotation, and using higher power engines, which merited its redesignation as the O/400.The  CHAPTER 1 TH
