The fastest version could reach a maximum speed of ninety-eight miles per hour at sea level, had an endurance of eight hours, a combat radius of over 220 miles, and a service ceiling of eighty-five hundred feet. In all, the manufacturer delivered 430 before the war's end. Although a large and unwieldy machine compared to the single- engine bombers, the Handley Page was little criticized by its crews, and during the summer of 1918 it had a lower accident rate than the single-engine DH-4s and F.E.s.18 The aircraft that would have carried the bombs to the German capital was the Handley Page V/1500, which first flew in May 1918. This bomber had greater capabil- ity than its predecessors, with a bomb load of seventy-five hundred pounds, over twelve hours of endurance, and up to five machine guns in three defensive positions. It had a (Left) The first four- engine British bomber was the Handley Page V/1500, which initially flew in May 1918. Each nacelle mounted a puller and pusher engine. Built to bomb Berlin from Britain, it did not see combat, although three were standing by when the Armistice was concluded. (Air University Press) span of 126 feet and was powered by four 375-hp engines configured tractor-pusher fashion in two nacelles. The manufacturer delivered the first three in November and apparently they were fueled and bombed up for an attack on Berlin when the Armistice was concluded. In the last five months of the war the IF dropped 550 tons of bombs, 390 tons at night. The British bombed targets dur- ing the war as deep as 150 miles within Germany, hitting Bonn, Cologne, Frankfurt, and Stuttgart. The cost was high: 109 aircraft were lost, acc
