Aircraft had more impact on the public than on the bat- tlefield, and more on the imagination than the reality. Air power showed greater results in tactical operations (certainly observation and reconnaissance and at times in direct support) than in strategic operations. Strate- gic bombing was a small portion of World War I air operations, certainly compared to what was to follow. The combatants con- ducted raids with only a handful of aircraft that carried meager bomb loads. With essen- tially no navigational aids, weather and night were serious obstacles, and it is little wonder the results were limited. At least one-fifth of the IF's bombs hit an unintended target or no useful target, and 5 percent of British and 6 percent of French bombs were duds. Study of the British bombing reveals that day bombing caused more property damage and casualties per ton of bomb dropped than did night bombing. What was the result of the World War I bombing experience? For one thing, the British, the prime target of the stra- tegic bombing, came to emphasize the  CHAPTER 1 O Chapter 2 psychological impact of bombing rather than its physical effects. This is probably an understatement, as this belief has been described as "evolv[ing] into a widespread obsession" and this attitude "became the predominant justification for the RAF."19 While the British experience in the trenches on the western front was similar to that of the other combatants, its experience with strategic bombing was not. The bombing of Britain, along with the acknowledged vulnerability of London, made the British public and politicians extremely sensitive. Aviation had drastically changed Britain's unique security position. As one Briton noted shortly after the first powered flight, "England is no longer an island."20 Yet the results of World War I bombing were overestimated: The physical impact of the strategic bombing was minimal, and while the bombing on occasion shook civil- ian morale, its impact tended to dim
