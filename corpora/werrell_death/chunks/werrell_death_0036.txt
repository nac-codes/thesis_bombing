rmance parity with fighter aircraft. The U.S. Superiority in Bomber Aviation America emerged from World War I with a large air force, albeit one that flew foreign- designed and -manufactured aircraft. In short order the postwar period brought a drastic draw-down in the U.S. military. Nevertheless, bolstered by a vibrant interest in flying and simulated by growing com- mercial aviation, in roughly a decade U.S. industry brought the country up to the state-of-the-art in long-range aviation. In January 1918 the Army contracted with the Martin Company to design a bomber superior to the World War I Handley Page. The resulting MB-1 (Martin's designation; GMB was its Army designation) first flew in August 1918. Smaller than the Handley Page, it was a twin-engine biplane fitted with five guns in three positions, manned by a three-man crew, with a top speed of 105 mph and a service ceiling of 10,300 feet. It was followed by the MB-2 (NBS-1, night bomber short range), ordered in June 1920. Although it looked the same, the NBS-1 had a larger wing and greater weight and could carry a heavier bomb load. The Army ordered about 130. While 21  THE INTERWAR YEARS it could carry three thousand pounds of bombs, its flying performance was less than its predecessor. Nevertheless the NBS-1 was significant as the aircraft that partici- pated in Billy Mitchell's bombing of surface ships in July 1921, made up the Army's entire bomber force with ninety aircraft in 1925, and equipped all eight Army bomb squadrons until the late 1920s, when it was replaced by the Keystone series. who had worked on a similar aircraft (the British Tarrant Tabor), to design an aircraft to carry bombs heavy enough to sink a battle- ship. (And thus the aircraft was later dubbed "Mitchell's Folly.") In May 1920 the Army Engineering Division issued ambitious specifications that included six machine guns, a five-thousand-pound bomb load, a twelve-hour endurance at ten thousand feet, and a maximum speed of one hundred
