Engineering Division issued ambitious specifications that included six machine guns, a five-thousand-pound bomb load, a twelve-hour endurance at ten thousand feet, and a maximum speed of one hundred miles per hour at sea level. The Air Service hired Barling to design the bomber, and Witte- mann-Lewis won a contract to build two of the aircraft, later reduced to one because of cost. The NBL-1 made its first flight in August 1923 and proved underpowered, restricted by the requirement to use the Liberty engines of which the United States had a surplus. Nevertheless, the Barling set a number of records for duration, load, and altitude with load. The Barling Bomber Of all the aircraft of the 1920s, none was as large or as bizarre as the Barling bomber (NBL-1, night bomber long distance). Its three wings, four rudders mounted in a biplane box tail, multiple wheels on its fixed landing gear, and birdcage of wires and struts made it an aeronautical monstrosity. The aircraft's poor performance further undercut the Barling's reputation. It is not surprising, then, that one author includes the bomber in his book The World's Worst Aircraft.2 This aircraft is the poster child for the airman's mantra, "If it don't look good, it can't fly good." The Air Service wanted a multiseat night bomber for long-range operations. More precisely this aircraft was pushed by Billy Mitchell, who in 1919 asked Walter Barling, The NBL-1 was the largest aircraft in the world. It was powered by six engines mounted in four nacelles, the inboard nacelles enclosing two engines that turned tractor and pusher props, the six producing a total of 2,400 hp. The Barling had a crew of a least four: two pilots seated side by side with dual controls and two flight engi- neers, along with a bombardier and gunners who manned seven guns mounted in five (Top) The MB-2 (NBS-1) equipped all of America's bomber forces in 1925 and served into the late years of that decade. It could carry three thousand pounds of bombs
