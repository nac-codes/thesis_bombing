requirements and specifications aircraft be categorized into seven groups, which included light bombers and heavy bombers. Light bombers would carry twelve hundred pounds or less, and heavy bombers more than that. Heavy bombers were to have three or more engines, be armed with four machine guns in two turrets, and be capable of achieving a service ceiling of ten thousand feet. The system was changed the next year to include categories for attack (A), bombardment (B), bomber long range (BLR), heavy bombardment (HB), and light bombardment (LB). In 1928 a number of airmen pushed for two specialized types of bombers: a long-range night bomber capable of carrying heavy loads and a short-range, high-speed day bomber with a lighter bomb load but heavier armament. This concept was supported by two air organizations (the Bombardment Board and the Air Corps Tactical School) that also endorsed the speci- fication for the high-speed bomber of 160 mph, a service ceiling of eighteen thousand feet, and a radius of 250 miles, with a bomb load of twelve hundred pounds and an arma- ment of six machine guns. In March 1930 the Air Corps Tactical School recommended the substitution of the day and night system with one that again categorized bombers by their bomb load: the light bomber with a maximum of twelve hundred pounds and the heavy bomber with a minimum of twenty-five hundred pounds. Other airmen saw range as the critical distinction between bomber types, a view aided by the rapidly improving aeronautical technology. ninety miles per hour, which was only slightly less than its top speed. the conversion of two observation aircraft, the Fokker (XO-27) and Douglas (XO-35), into fast bombers. Both had retractable landing gear and were powered by 600-hp engines. Fokker delivered the XB-8 to the Air Corps in February 1931; the Douglas XB-7 appeared slightly later. The Fokker could reach 160 mph, the Douglas 169 mph, despite open cockpits and wing struts. The XB-7 proved superior, leadi
