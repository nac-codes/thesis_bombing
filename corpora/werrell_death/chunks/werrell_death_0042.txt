tabs that employed aerody- namic forces to assist the pilot. The Air Corps During the 1920s the airmen's concep- tion of bombers was in flux, as seen in their shifting aircraft designation systems. In September 1919 the Air Service adopted an aircraft designation system of fifteen aircraft types, including three bomber categories: day bombardment (DB), night bombardment short distance (NBS), and night bombard- ment long distance (NBL). In 1923 a board of officers recommended that for the The Army, that is, the non-airmen, however, wanted a single general-purpose bomber to save money. This led in 1928 to The Martin B-10 While neither a strategic nor long-range bomber, the Martin B-10 demonstrated U.S. technological prowess and leadership in bomber aircraft, which the United States has maintained since this aircraft's first flight. The Martin Company produced a brilliant design that incorporated most of the tech- nological advances of the day-all-metal construction,3 twin engines, monoplane configuration, an enclosed bomb bay, and  26 THE INTERWAR YEARS retractable landing gear-with only one regressive element: three open cockpits. The XB-907 initially flew in February 1932 and went off to Dayton for testing that summer, where it registered a top speed of 197 mph and a service ceiling of twenty thousand feet. This performance was impressive, offset by problems with severe engine vibrations that shook loose rivets, wires, and brackets and a higher landing speed and longer takeoff roll than of existing aircraft. Martin went back to the drawing board and made some significant additions that included a larger wing, more powerful engines, an enclosed manual nose gun turret, and full engine cowlings. These changes increased the top speed to 207 mph, the world's first 200-mph bomber, and reduced landing speed from 81 mph to 71 mph. The Army ordered forty-eight production aircraft which incorporated two sliding canopies, one over the pilot and the other over the rear gunner.
