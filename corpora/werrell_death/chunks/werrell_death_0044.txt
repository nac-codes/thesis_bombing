ry "Hap" Arnold led ten B-10s on an eighty-three-hundred-mile flight to Alaska and back in the summer of 1934, which attracted considerable press attention. The Martin bomber also made distant flights to Argentina and the Dutch East Indies. The government prohibited Martin from selling the B-10 to foreign govern- ments until 1936. Then a number of air forces bought the bomber, including those of Argentina, China, Holland, Russia, Siam, and Turkey. The Chinese Martins saw action in 1937, with two dropping leaflets over Nagasaki, Japan, in May 1939. (It later would be one of the first and one of the last American targets in the Pacific war.) The B-10 dominated the bomber class in the early 1930s but in turn fell victim to rapidly advancing aviation technology. Martin entered it in the 1936 Air Corps bomber competition in which the Boeing B-17 was the overwhelming winner. The B-10 would see action early in World War II, but was quickly shot out of the skies. The Really Big Bombers The issue of desired aircraft type, fueled by rapid technical progress, became embroiled in a roles and missions fight in the United States. Traditionally, and understandably, the Navy had the responsibility for the sea-based protection of the U.S. coast, while the Army had the responsibility for land-based defenses. The increasing range of 27 aircraft upset this tidy division as the Navy put aircraft aboard ships and ashore while the increasing range of land-based aircraft allowed the Army to extend its operations well beyond the shore line and the previous line of demarcation, the range of its coast defense artillery. This situation led to dupli- cation and conflict between the services. The Air Corps pushed the coast defense mission, which fit in with its quest for longer range bombers. In November 1931 the Air Corps advised the Army chief of staff that the airmen should develop a long- range reconnaissance aircraft, and in 1933 the Air Corps chief defined its coast defense responsibility
