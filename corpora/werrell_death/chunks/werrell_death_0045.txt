ember 1931 the Air Corps advised the Army chief of staff that the airmen should develop a long- range reconnaissance aircraft, and in 1933 the Air Corps chief defined its coast defense responsibility in terms of the maximum range of aircraft. That same year Brig. Gen. Oscar Westover, then assistant chief of the Air Corps and later the chief, stated that "high speed and otherwise high-perform- ing bombardment aircraft, together with observation aviation of superior speed and range and communications characteristics, will suffice for the adequate air defense of this country."4 In that same report Westo- ver further noted that the high speed of bomber aircraft combined with its ability to fly in close formation meant that "no known agency can frustrate the accom- plishment of a bombardment mission."5 The connection between what kind of bomber and the missions of coast defense and strategic bombardment were entangled by the rapid technological changes taking place. This is not the place to sort out the relative importance of these factors but only to observe that they all were present and all played a role in what transpired.  CHAPTER 2 THE INTERWAR YEARS (Left) The Boeing B-15 was an ambitious giant that exceeded the technology of the day. It had a greater wing span than its offspring (the B-29) but fell short of its range requirement, had limited performance, and was difficult to handle. (National Museum of the USAF) Concurrently an Air Corps engineer- ing study concluded that one aircraft could combine the reconnaissance and bombing function and reach out five thousand miles, with a bomb load of two thousand pounds and a speed of two hundred miles per hour. In December 1933 the Air Corps proposed to build such an aircraft, "Project A," which was quickly approved. In May 1934 the chief of the Air Corps authorized negotia- tions with Boeing and Martin for designs for such a machine with the stated mission of destroying distant land or naval targets and reinforcing Hawa
