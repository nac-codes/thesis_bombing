cheated by time."9 These statements are a mixture of romanticism and rhetoric, hyperbole and fact. Less poetic but more to the point, the B-15 was just too ambitious for the technology of the day (specifically, the power plants). The rapidly advancing technology outmoded the aircraft even before it took to the air, as demon- strated by another Boeing product, the famous B-17 Flying Fortress. Meanwhile the airmen put another giant into the sky. The B-19 was even larger than the B-15 and thus a greater challenge. In 1935 the Air Corps invited both the Douglas and Sikorsky companies to compete in "Project D" to build the aircraft, funding both to design it, then picked Douglas to build the flying article. But by the summer of 1938 Douglas had lost interest in the project, and in an unprecedented move the company recommended that it be cancelled because the design was outmoded, its weight was dramatically increasing, and Douglas needed personnel for other designs more certain of production. Nevertheless the Air Corps pressed on, albeit at a slower pace. The XB-19 finally made its first flight in June 1941. Testing revealed brake problems, and although the aircraft could reach a top  30 THE INTERWAR YEARS rendered obsolete by later bomber and fighter technology. As we shall soon see, other bombers would wage the strategic air war for the United States, specifically the B-17 and B-24 in the European theater and mainly the B-29 in the Pacific theater. speed of 224 mph for a limited time, over- heating of its R 3350 engines forced the use of the engine coolers, which reduced the maximum speed to 204 mph. The last major change came in January 1944, when the more powerful Allison liquid-cooled engines replaced the Wright radial engines, which led the airmen to redesignate the bomber XB-19A. With the Allisons, top speed increased to 265 mph, and service ceiling rose from thirteen thousand to thirty-nine thousand feet. However, the giant aircraft needed much greater power to p
