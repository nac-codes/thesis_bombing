mber XB-19A. With the Allisons, top speed increased to 265 mph, and service ceiling rose from thirteen thousand to thirty-nine thousand feet. However, the giant aircraft needed much greater power to propel its enormous bulk at competitive speeds. Unlike the B-15 the Douglas bomber did not set any records nor make any memorable flights. However, its contribution was similar; it was an exercise in designing, building, and operating a giant aircraft, as was its claim to fame, its size. It was in a line of development of giant aircraft that featured long-range and heavy defensive armament, French and Soviet Programs Although only three countries engaged in strategic air warfare during World War II, two additional nations built strategic bombers in the interwar years. The Soviets deployed a large and successful air force and more heavy bombers than any other nation during this period. The French also built heavy bombers, but as with their main defense preparations, these were too little, too late. The Russians were the first to field a four-engine bomber, although they did not engage in strategic bombing during World War I. In the civil war that followed, Even larger than the B-15 was the Douglas B-19, which was obsolete before its maiden flight in June 1941. It employed two innovations, revers- ible pitch propellers and powered gun turrets, but it proved to be another lackluster performer. As with the other abortive giants, it is remembered for its size and lack of success. (National Museum of the USAF) The Soviet TB-3 first flew in December 1930. It is notable not for its flying or operational performance but because more were built than any other strategic bomber during the interwar period. Note the parasite fighters hung underwing. (San Diego Air and Space Museum) aviation did not prove significant. After the war, however, the new Soviet regime put considerable emphasis on aviation as a symbol of modernism and communism. The Russians built a number of large bombers.
