on did not prove significant. After the war, however, the new Soviet regime put considerable emphasis on aviation as a symbol of modernism and communism. The Russians built a number of large bombers. The most famous large aircraft, although a propaganda machine rather than a bomber, was the eight-engine Maxim Gorky, which had a 207-foot wing span and first flew in June 1934. Another was the five-engine ANT-14.10 Our interest is more narrow: the Soviet heavy bombers. The four-engine ANT-6 began in December 1926, first flew in December 1930, and was redesignated as TB-3. The aircraft was like others of the day, a low-wing, all-metal monoplane with open crew positions and fixed landing gear. It was defended by ten machine guns in five posi- tions, carried a bomb load of twenty-two hundred to forty-nine hundred pounds, and had a top speed of 186 mph. Later versions reduced the defensive armament and crew. The aircraft went into service in 1932 and 31 flew in the various Soviet conflicts of the late 1930s and in World War II as a transport. The significance of the bomber is that about 820 were built between 1932 and 1937, the largest fleet of long-range, heavy (strategic) bombers fielded during the interwar years. But events in the second half of that decade, specifically the Spanish Civil War and the purges, dampened if not killed strategic bombing ideas in Russia. So ended what one historian has described as "the Soviet's brief but serious flirtation with the strategic bombing ideas of Giulio Douhet."11 In 1934 the Soviets put forth a specifica- tion for a better long-range bomber that became the ANT-42, later known as the TB-7 and then as the Pe-8. It first flew in December 1936. An unusual modification mounted a fifth engine in the fuselage to power the superchargers that doubled its service ceiling from fifteen thousand to over thirty-five thousand feet and gave it a top speed of 250 miles per hour, which enabled it to outrun German Bf 109Bs and He 112s  CHAPTER 2 3
