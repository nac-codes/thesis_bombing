After Italy's entry into World War I, Douhet pushed hard for a massive aviation build up, but his criticism of Italy's floundering war effort led to his court-martial and a one-year prison sentence. However, Italy's poor wartime performance allowed him to gain a high position in Italy's air arm dur- ing the conflict, although his court-martial was not reversed until the war's end. He was promoted to general and later became a supporter of Benito Mussolini, who gave him a high position after coming to power, although in short order he resigned. He died in 1930, only a few years before his ideas would be tried and tested in the largest war in man's history. States.

A translation of the second edition of the book was in circula- tion in the Air Corps in 1933, and Douhet was mentioned in Air Corps Tactical School lectures in the 1930s. Douhet wrote that the next war would be a total war with no boundaries in regards to geography or targets. He saw no defense against aircraft.

Therefore the airmen should concentrate on independent (read: strategic) opera- tions, n
