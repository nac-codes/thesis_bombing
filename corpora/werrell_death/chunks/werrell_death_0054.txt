the critical target, and air power's offensive nature were believed by many during the interwar years, and for that mat- ter since then. And while World War II did not confirm Douhet's ideas, and may in fact have refuted some if not many of them, the emergence of the long-range bomber deliv- ering nuclear weapons during that conflict certainly gave new life to them. These early and far reaching predictions of the future of air power merit the position that Douhet has achieved as the most important advocate of strategic air power. for crew morale, and that "pursuit planes must clear the sky of enemy interference before the bombers can accomplish their mission."17 He astutely saw that air warfare's biggest difficulty, one that remains to this day, was targeting. His most controversial beliefs, and what usually passes for the shorthand summary of Douhet's views, are that air war could be decisive and that civilian morale was the key target. He believed that all "citizens will become combatants [as] . .. there will be no distinction any longer between soldiers and civilians."18 In his words, "By bombing the most vital civilian centers [air attack] could spread terror through the nation and quickly break down [the enemy's] material and moral resistance."19 He further held that "mercifully, the decision will be quick in this kind of war ... [and] these future wars may yet prove to be more humane than wars in the past in spite of all, because they may in the long run shed less blood."20 Douhet made a number of state- British airmen held essentially the same positions as Douhet. Hugh Trenchard (1873-1956), who led the RAF (1918-30) during its infant years and is credited with being its father and savior, wrote in 1916 that the airplane was an offensive weapon that could not be stopped by defensive aircraft. Thus he favored building as many bombers and as few fighters as possible. Also like Douhet he saw air superiority as the first goal of air forces. During World War I he
