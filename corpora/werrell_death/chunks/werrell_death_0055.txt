stopped by defensive aircraft. Thus he favored building as many bombers and as few fighters as possible. Also like Douhet he saw air superiority as the first goal of air forces. During World War I he pushed interdiction targets as the focus of British bombing, although he did see the importance of a number of strategic targets. He is best known for his emphasis on the effect of bombing on morale, which he ments that would prove to be in error. For example, he believed the power of antiair- craft artillery was limited, that firepower not speed would determine the aerial battle, that civilian aircraft could be converted into effective bombers, and that poison gas would be widely used. In addition he grossly overestimated bombing destruction.21 In an article published only a few days after his death in 1930, Douhet wrote that a future war between France and Germany would be over in a day. In brief, Douhet had broad, bold, imagi- native ideas on strategic bombing and put these into print early. Working on the lim- ited experience of World War I, he saw the 35 The Italian Giulio Douhet (1869-1930) remains the eminent strategic bombardment theorist. His classic book The Command of the Air appeared in 1921 and held that bombing could be decisive and civilian morale was the key target.

(This may have originated from bomb- ing's limited power against physical targets as contrasted with its terrifying impact on morale.) "Using a subjective and unprov- able statistic that earned him much (largely undeserved) ridicule," one author notes, "Trenchard stated that the psychological effects of bombing outweighed the material effects at a ratio of 20 to one."22 However, in 1928 Trenchard wrote
