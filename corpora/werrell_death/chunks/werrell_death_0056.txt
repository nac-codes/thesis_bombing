rgely undeserved) ridicule," one author notes, "Trenchard stated that the psychological effects of bombing outweighed the material effects at a ratio of 20 to one."22 However, in 1928 Trenchard wrote of the need to target military objectives and avoid "indiscriminate bombing of a city for the sole purpose of terrorizing the civilian population."23 The RAF survived during the lean interwar years, due in large measure to Trenchard's skill in fighting and manipulat- ing the bureaucracy. During this period the RAF took two roads, one in the field and one in theory that enabled it to maintain its independence. In practical terms the RAF carved out a niche for itself by helping pac- ify colonial uprisings with the tactic of"air control," which used bombing to selectively Hugh Trenchard (1873-1956) (left) commanded British strategic bombers during World War I, fathered the RAF, and preserved it following the conflict. He saw bombers as an offensive weapon that were unstoppable and believed morale was the primary target. (National Museum of the USAF) 37 harass, intimidate, and coerce those who got out of line. Air control proved effective as well as far cheaper than conventional puni- tive expeditions, which fit the British quest for reducing their military budget. However, operations against tribesmen armed with rifles did not prepare an air force for an air war against a major power. Ironically, in view of what would transpire in World War II (and his role in promoting that tactic), Winston Churchill noted dur- ing World War I that he doubted "that any terrorization of the civil population which could be achieved by air attack would compel the Government of a great nation to surrender."24 At the same time the airmen developed a strategic bombing concept. Britain feared an aerial assault, the so-called "knock out blow," more than any other country. In 1924 the RAF estimated that based on World War I experience, one ton of bombs would inflict fifty casualties and that the F
