sport has been strongly inculcated [Western Europeans and former British colonials?], it is peculiarly abhorrent to contemplate the waging of war on unarmed civilians of all ages and sexes."29  CHAPTER 2 THE INTERWAR YEARS 41 bomber temporary ascendancy over the fighter. Technical developments obviously influenced doctrine, and the officers at the Tac School thought mostly in terms of the future. They added two distinctive elements to create the American strategic bombing theory. attributed to Tactical School instructor Kenneth Walker (1898-1943) that the "well- organized, well-planned, and well-flown air force attack will constitute an offensive that cannot be stopped."31 First, the American bombing advocates maintained the bombers could reach their targets without escort and without suffering undue attrition. This was a break from the past because it had been neither their World War I experience nor what appeared in their writings and lectures during the early 1920s. While escort was considered useful, most if not all airmen around the world believed it was technically impossible to build an aircraft with both fighter performance and bomber range. It was late in the 1920s when the "unescorted" bombing theory evolved with American airmen insisting that bomb- ers maintaining tight formations, mounting heavy defensive firepower, and flying at high speed could nullify enemy fighters. Escort was considered desirable but unobtainable and unnecessary. Certainly the American airmen attempted to provide fighter escort, with most attention focused on fielding a heavily armed, multiseat, multiengine air- craft-a concept advanced as early as 1920. While such an aircraft offered the advantages of greater range and heavier firepower, efforts to build one with performance com- petitive with defensive fighters failed. The airmen also discounted antiaircraft artillery, positing that high-altitude operations would lessen or neutralize its impact. In brief, and in words that serve
