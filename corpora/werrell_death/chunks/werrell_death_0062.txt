tive with defensive fighters failed. The airmen also discounted antiaircraft artillery, positing that high-altitude operations would lessen or neutralize its impact. In brief, and in words that serve as a military analog to Stanley Baldwin's famous quote, American bomber advocates believed in the phrase The absence of a practical escort did not upset the bombing enthusiasts. As we shall see, the advent of the B-17 confirmed the bomber advocates' faith in unescorted bomber operations as here was a aircraft that could outfly, outgun, and thus outfight fighters-at least when it first took to the air in the mid-1930s. The American bomb- ing theory emerged during 1930-35 at a time when the bomber had achieved at least technological parity with the fighter. Little wonder that the "dominating echelon [in the Air Corps], both numerically and in terms of rank, firmly believed that a bomber, through applying proper formation and mutual defense, could whip opposing fighters, pen- etrate to the target and destroy it, and that therefore there was no need for fighters."32 Bomber proponents failed to foresee that the defense would also benefit from advancing technology (especially radar) and that the fighter would regain its ascendancy. The American strategic bombing theory was formulated at the Air Corps Tactical School, where Kenneth Walker (1898-1943) was an instructor and a prime contributor to this theory. He was killed in action early in World War II leading a bombing mission and was awarded the Medal of Honor. (Air University History Office) He had no confidence that international law would prevent such attacks but wrote that "a potent restraint will always be exercised by the fear of reprisals."30 Sherman also noted that industry was made of a complex system of interlocking factories, so that only key plants had to be destroyed to cripple the entire economy, what later would be called the "bottleneck" or "strategic web" theory. The last point was the crux of what became th
