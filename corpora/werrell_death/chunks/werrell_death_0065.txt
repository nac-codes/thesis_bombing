the most important conflicts was the Russian civil war, which raged between 1917 and 1922, in which aviation played no significant role. Aircraft were sparsely employed, but certainly not strategic aviation. The same was true in the Allied interventions in Russia (1917-22), the Russo-Polish War (1920), and the Greco-Turkish War (1920-22), and the one major war in the Western Hemisphere, the 1933-35 Chaco War.33 Air power was more important in the one-sided Italian war against Ethiopia (1935-36). The war's image of spear-wielding Ethiopians fighting against poison gas obscures the effective Italian use 43 of air power, especially air transport, in dif- ficult conditions.

By mid-1937 the Nationalists had regained air superiority, an advantage they main- tained for the remainder of the war. The conflict in Spain in 1936-39 was not as important in shaping the twentieth- century world as the revolutions in China and Russia, yet from the point of view of air power it was the most important of the interwar conflicts. Because of the large number of aircraft engaged, their quality, and the war's location, this conflict was closely watched by the militaries of the major powers. In July 1936 a military coup failed to topple the government in Spain leading to a prolonged and costly civil war. Germany and Italy quickly sent men and machines to assist the rebels (known as Nationalists). The airlift of Spanish regular troops across the Straits of Gibraltar and over the Spanish navy, which remained mostly loyal to the government (known as Republicans), by German Ju 52s probably saved the revolt and was the most decisive use of air power in the war. The initial aircraft employed were upgraded versions of World War I aircraft, albeit with better performance. While the bulk of the Spanish air force remained loyal to the government, German and Italian aid gave
