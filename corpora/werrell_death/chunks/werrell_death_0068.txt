George Kenney, one of the United States' top air generals during and after World War II, wrote that there was no legitimate test of air power in Spain as both sides lacked a true air force and the numbers to fight a real air war. Other American officers con- curred. One noted that only small air forces were engaged, bombs were light, no gas was used, and there was restraint. Another wrote that while aircraft had not lived up to expectations, Douhet's theories had not been tested. A fourth warned that a future war might not be like the Spanish Civil War. In a 1937 speech at the Army War College, Henry Arnold, wartime chief of the Army Air Forces, stated, "The powers, capabilities One last note about the Spanish Civil War is that the Germans gained much knowledge from the conflict. They were able to not only combat test some of the hardware that would be important in the coming conflict but also to train their men and work out tactics. This combination, more than Luftwaffe numbers, was to be the most important factor in the early German victories in World War II. The Soviets also should have benefited from the experience in Spain. However, Joseph Stalin's purges of the late 1930s decimated the Russian military, especially those who had served in Spain. One lesson, that superior German equipment and tactics made clear, was the need for modernization. Certainly the Sovi- ets learned that tactical support was more effective than strategic bombing.

They may have sent more than eight hundred, and perhaps as many as one thousand, aircraft to the Chinese, but they had no significant impact on the war. More significant to
