transport Tante Ju (Auntie Ju), the German counterpart to the classic Douglas DC-3/C-47 "Gooney Bird."2 The Ju 52/3m made its maiden flight in April 1931 and was distinguished by its three engines, fixed landing gear, and strategic bombing and did make efforts to introduce a strategic bomber, but it failed. This constitutes one of the intriguing ques- tions of the war: What if the Germans had fielded a satisfactory long-range bomber? In the 1920s the Germans built a few four-engine bombers, the Rohrbach Roland and Dornier P, and in the 1930s the Ju 89 and Do 19. The GAF began plans for a long-range bomber in 1934,and gave the program top priority in their development program. In the summer of 1935 the Luft- waffe issued Dornier and Junkers a require- ment for a four-engine heavy bomber that became known as the "Ural Bomber" because it was to have sufficient range to reach east of Russia's Ural Mountains. This plan called for full-scale production by 1938. While the Luftwaffe chief was a recent convert to the idea of strategic bombing, there were many in the GAF who opposed the concept, fearing it would overextend the already stretched German training establish- ment and war industry. The Junkers response was to use its Ju 86 airframe and substitute gasoline engines for the diesels. The resulting Ju 89 was a low-wing monoplane powered by four liquid-cooled engines, featuring twin verti- cal stabilizers and defended by two 7.9-mm guns, one in the cockpit and one in the tail, along with single 20-mm cannons mounted in dorsal and ventral turrets. In April 1936 the Germans issued new specifications for the aircraft that almost doubled the range and speed requirements, clearly beyond the state of the art, leading some to speculate that this was a move to kill it and the com- peting Dornier (Do 19) project. The death of the program's patron, GAF chief Walther Wever, in June 1936 and the emergence of a more advanced heavy bomber project ("Bomber A," which spawned the He 17
