peting Dornier (Do 19) project. The death of the program's patron, GAF chief Walther Wever, in June 1936 and the emergence of a more advanced heavy bomber project ("Bomber A," which spawned the He 177) put the "Ural Bomber" program in jeopardy. In addition, German air staff thinking shifted to the belief that medium bombers could satisfy Germany's tactical and strategic needs. Factors behind this change included the success of the dive bomber in Spain, the inaccuracy of horizontal bombing,3 the fact that two and a half twin-engine bombers could be built at the same cost as one four- engine bomber, and Germany's shortage of materials. The GAF put its hopes and money on the Ju 88. Meanwhile the Ju 89 made its initial flight in December 1936, only months before its termination in April 1937. The Germans continued to test the aircraft before converting it to a transport. The bomber could reach a maximum speed of 242 mph without armament and was designed to carry a bomb load of thirty-five hundred pounds. The Junkers' rival, the Do 19, was no improvement, and in fact it was slower. It too had twin vertical stabilizers but was powered by four radial engines mounted on a wing set midway on the fuselage. The aircraft's defensive armament consisted of a single 7.9-mm gun in the nose and tail and a single 20-mm cannon in dorsal and ventral turrets. The aircraft first flew in October 1936. The bomber is credited with a top speed of 196 mph and was designed to carry thirty-five hundred pounds of bombs. The Luftwaffe was a powerful tool in Hitler's march to power. It helped cow the Western nations into allowing the remili- tarization of the Rhineland in March 1936, the annexation of Austria in March 1938, The German experience with heavy bombers was much less satisfactory. The GAF was interested in the concept of  CHAPTER 3 GERMAN STRATEGIC BOMBARDMENT 51 and the shameless sellout of Czechoslo- vakia that September. The threat of war, particularly the fear of bombing of cities,
