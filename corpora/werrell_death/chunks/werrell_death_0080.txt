h explosive and seventy-two tons of incendiaries on Warsaw. (Thirty Ju 52s were involved, with aircrew literally shoveling incendiary bombs out of the aircraft.) The attack killed thousands of civilians, destroyed 10 percent of the city's buildings, and cost the GAF three aircraft. Although Warsaw was a legitimate military target because it was defended and already under German artillery fire, the attack was elevated to far more. The Germans made a propaganda film, Baptism by Fire, that played up the ferocity and efficiency of the air attacks, which stoked the fears of Western politicians and the public. On their part, the Allies and sympathetic neutrals wrote of German bar- barity in attacking the city and civilians. After a brief lull, in April 1940 the Germans quickly overran Denmark and Norway. The Luftwaffe was again effective in supporting the ground troops, although more important in battering the Royal Navy and in deploying German forces. The next month the Germans attacked the Low Countries and France and won a stunning victory despite the Allied numerical advan- tage in troops and tanks (the Germans had superior numbers of aircraft).  CHAPTER 3 GERMAN STRATEGIC BOMBARDMENT One action in the western campaign is significant to our story. With their ground forces stalled outside of Rotterdam and fearing imminent British landings, the Ger- mans wanted to take the city as quickly as possible. They threatened to bomb the city, and a German general gave the order "to break the resistance at Rotterdam by every means" with the caveat to "use all means to prevent unnecessary bloodshed amongst the Dutch population."7 On May 14 the GAF launched one hundred He 111s against the city, which the ground commander attempted to halt as negotiations with the defenders were underway. Unfortunately fifty-seven bombers failed to receive the recall signal because of a breakdown of radio communications and poor visibility that negated the backup signals (flares). As a consequence
