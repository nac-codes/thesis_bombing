ay. Unfortunately fifty-seven bombers failed to receive the recall signal because of a breakdown of radio communications and poor visibility that negated the backup signals (flares). As a consequence ninety-seven tons of bombs hit the city and created a fierce fire in the old wooden buildings and factories, killing nine hundred to one thousand civilians. Again the propagandists on both sides played up the attack to the debit of history. Another conse- quence of the attack was that the British saw no further need to restrain their bombing raids to attacks west of the Rhine. had mastered so easily in the past, for this was more than a "mere" river crossing; to get at the British army it would have to defeat (or neutralize) both the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy. The German failure against the former was clearly one of the decisive battles of World War II and probably the most sig- nificant air campaign of all time.

(In early August the GAF had 805 service- able Me 109s facing 715 RAF Spitfires and Hurricanes.)8 These fighters were essentially equivalent in quality, each having advantages and deficits. Initially the GAF had an edge in experience and tactics versus the RAF's advantage of a well-organized air defense system built around radar, which provided early warning of the attackers and control of the defenders. In addition the British were fighting over their own soil, allowing higher pilot and aircraft survival.9 The Battle of Britain The quick and overwhelming German victory on the Continent left Britain without allies, with a battered army facing the experienced and triumphant German military, and with the prospect of defeat. Hitler assumed the British would show good sense and surrender to, or at least com- promise with, the inevitable. However, the Germans faced
