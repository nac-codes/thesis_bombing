the GAF night attacks continued against weak RAF air defenses.11 In the end the fierce German attack failed to break British morale (it actually stiffened) or defeat RAF fighter command. Although both combatants submitted exaggerated vic- tory claims of enemy aircraft destroyed (the GAF 3,058 and the RAF 2,698), it appears that the RAF downed almost twice as many German aircraft as they lost (1,733 and 915, respectively). These were heavy losses for both air forces, especially in terms of aircrew. It should be emphasized that experienced pilots rather than numbers of aircraft proved  CHAPTER 3 GERMAN STRATEGIC BOMBARDMENT well and improved as the fight unfolded; the GAF did neither. aircraft that downed only two GAF aircraft. The bombing was remarkably accurate due to excellent navigational aids,15 limited Brit- ish resistance, and low bombing altitudes. The attack destroyed or severely damaged one-third of the city's factories, killed 570, and seriously injured another 860 of the city's population of about 230,000.The six-hundred-year-old cathedral was among the buildings destroyed. Allegations of prior notice of the attack and Coventry's deliber- ate sacrifice to preserve the secret of broken German codes still abound, but are untrue. The principal significance of the Cov- Thus RAF Fighter Command broke the German string of overwhelming victories and their aura of invincibility. The British remained unconquered. The prewar air power theorists had been disproved- defense against bombers was possible- and while the bombers might "always get through," they did so without achieving decisive effect while suffering unsustain- able losses. The Battle of Britain was the primary factor in why the Germans did not attempt a cross-Channel invasion and therefore clearly deserves credit in changing the course of World War II. Finally, it is no discredit to the British people, to those who served in the air defense, particularly those "few" Fighter Command pilots, to note that
