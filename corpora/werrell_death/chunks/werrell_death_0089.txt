d Soviet industry from attack, and once the war degenerated into a bloody slugfest, the Ger- mans needed all the air power they could muster to support their beleaguered troops. The only example of strategic bombing was a brief campaign in June 1943, when the Luftwaffe flew almost one thousand sorties dropping about 1,000 tons of bombs on a tank factory, 324 tons on a rubber plant, and 181 tons on an oil refinery. In May 1944 the GAF transferred He 177s to join newly formed units in East Prussia to mass ninety bombers for attacks on Soviet supply and assembly targets. The He 177s oper- ated at high altitudes against light resistance and thus suffered minimal losses. Even the longstanding problems with engine fires seemed to be solved. However, when a Russian offensive erupted in June 1944, the Germans thrust the He 177s into action as ground support aircraft and took heavy losses, losing more than ten of twenty-four bombers during the first low-level attack. None of the various imaginative German schemes to hit Soviet power plants and dams (bombers, commandoes, guided bombs, mines, suicide attacks, and Mistel weapons) were employed.19 The He 177 also engaged in strategic attacks. In December 1943 Hitler ordered a response to the Allied bombing of Germany with raids on British cities. The GAF massed its bombers, including thirty-five to forty- six He 177s among the four hundred to five hundred aircraft involved. The "Little Blitz" began on January 21-22, 1944, with 270 sorties, including a dozen flown by He 177s. RAF night fighters claimed two of the latter, and German flak a third. The He 177s logged 5 of the 125 sorties on the last large bomber attack on London (April 18-19). These raids faded out by the end of May. The Germans launched missiles from He 177s against the Normandy invasion. The cost was high as on its first operation, one He 177 unit lost half of twenty-six bombers committed and the next day another six. In short order, the bombers were directed to s
