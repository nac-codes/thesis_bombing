campaign against an ill-defined threat."23 This effort was costly, achieved little payback, and appears to have been motivated more by political than military factors. Both American and Brit- ish airmen complained that it diverted the bombers from both the strategic campaign and support of the cross-Channel inva- sion. An RAF strike on the Peenem√ºnde facility in August 1943 may have delayed the V-2 program six to eight weeks, but it did not impact the V-1 program. Later that month U.S. bombers began attacking seven massive structures built to house German secret weapons (four for the V-1s) near the French coast. Hitler favored these huge structures, although some of his subordinates pushed for smaller, simpler, cheaper, and more readily concealed launching positions. The airmen detected these smaller launch facilities they called ski sites and began a major bombing campaign against them in December 1943. By June 1944 the airmen estimated they had destroyed eighty-two of ninety-six identified sites. Although none of the ski sites launched a missile that reached Britain, the effort cost the Allies 154 aircraft and 771 crewmembers. Some see this battle of the ski sites as a successful diversion- ary campaign as the Germans responded by constructing even smaller, easier built, and less visible (modified) launch sites. Hitler was reported to have said that every bomb dropped on a V-1 site was one less bomb on Germany. Between August 1943 and August 1944, 12 percent of the Allied heavy bomber sorties and 15 percent of the medium bomber sorties were involved in this campaign. For a number of reasons the British and Americans attacked only one of the modified sites so that by June 1944 the Germans had about half of the 150 sites ready for combat. The V-1 campaign was delayed less by the bombing than by other factors. The original German plans called for the V-1 offensive to begin in mid-December 1943 with the monthly production rate reaching eight thousand V-1s by Septembe
