perhaps impossible.")30 It was not that the V-weapons came too late in the war, but that they came too soon, before they were mature enough to be effective military weapons. In Summary During World War II German bombers rained just over seventy-one thousand tons of high explosive on Britain;V-1s, fifty-eight hundred tons; and V-2s, eleven hundred tons. These weapons inflicted 147,000 civilian casualties, of which 61,000 were killed, 84 percent killed by GAF bombers. Strategic bombardment was not as central to German strategy in World War II as it was to the Western Allies. Consequently, compared to the Anglo-American strategic bombing campaign, the German bombing effort was puny. It is ironic that early in the war the GAF was better prepared to conduct strategic bombing than were the Western Allies, employing navigational equipment and tactics not matched by their foes for years. However, at that point they lacked the numbers and aircraft to conduct an effective offensive. A few years later the Luftwaffe effort was greatly surpassed by what the AAF and RAF were able to mount. Unlike the British and Americans, the main air power effort of the Germans (and Russians) was tactical. The only area of strategic bom- bardment in which the Germans eclipsed the Americans and British was with missiles, and these proved premature and futile. The impact of the V-weapons was clearly more psychological than physical, more political than military. These could only be a terror weapon because they were deficient in reliability, accuracy, destructive capacity, range, and numbers. It is true they scared the Allies, tied down resources, and altered Allied plans, but at this stage in the war the British and Americans had a surplus of power, in sharp contrast to the Germans. Once the United States entered the war, and as long as the Soviets were engaged full time, Germany was doomed; no weapon aside from a nuclear bomb could possibly save them from defeat.
