tates entered the war, and as long as the Soviets were engaged full time, Germany was doomed; no weapon aside from a nuclear bomb could possibly save them from defeat. A wiser allocation of resources that emphasized, for example, in the air war, jet aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, and proximity fuses, could have made the Allied air offen- sive more expensive and less effective, but that would not have changed the outcome of the war. For the Germans could not with- stand the attrition of the multifront ground war. In brief, then, the V-weapons were innovative, foreshadowing the air weapons of the future, but mere footnotes in the course of World War II. But as we shall see, the V-1 andV-2 were the forerunners of much more effective strategic weapons. The Germans also used the V-2 against continental targets. While the attacks on Britain were strategic, attempting to break British morale, the attacks on the Continent were tactical. The Germans fired 1,600 V-2 against Antwerp, 1,300 of which impacted in the city area, 600 in the city, and 150 in the harbor area (the designated target). These killed 5,100 and injured 22,000. The V-2 attacks against Britain and Antwerp ended in late March 1945. The V-weapons were technological innovations that had essentially no effect on the course of the war. (As with so many aspects of the war, there are many "what ifs." For example, Eisenhower wrote that had the Germans employed the V-weapons six  68 BRITISH STRATEGIC BOMBING Chapter 4 British Strategic Bombing DESTRUCTION BY NIGHT ar came swiftly and disastrously for the Western Allies. By mid- W 1940 Britain stood alone against a triumphant Germany, while the Soviets looked on and fed the German economy and Americans observed from afar, sympa- thetic but uninvolved. The British survived, although for the next number of years they were besieged by U boats, bombed by the Luftwaffe, and beaten up by German ground forces around the Mediterranean.
