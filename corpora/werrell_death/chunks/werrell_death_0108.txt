of the RAF's fifty-two squadrons be equipped with bombers. These policies, along with the need to economize, led the British to field a number of single- and twin-engine biplanes that looked and performed like their World War I predecessors. for the conversion of Bomber Command to four-engine bombers by 1943, plans that raised issues of both money and manufac- turing capability. In December 1937 the British revised their offensive plan to one that emphasized air defense. In any event the RAF was ill prepared when Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 and World War II in Europe began. Opening Rounds The outbreak of war found Bomber Com- mand with seventeen of its thirty-three operational squadrons classified as heavy bomber units. Strategic bombing plans called for attacks on the GAF, the aircraft industry, and military transportation, as well as strikes specifically on oil and industry in the Ruhr, Rhineland, and Saar. Bomber Command realized it lacked the power to destroy all these targets but believed that power, coking plants, and oil were special German vulner- abilities. In brief, the airmen were thinking in terms of a bottleneck approach using daylight, unescorted precision bombing tac- tics. Events would show that while the RAF had solved most of the problems of defensive air warfare early in the war, it faced a long, difficult, and costly struggle to mount an effective offensive campaign. Thus in the early 1930s British bombers were considerably outmoded by the more modern bombers taking to the air in the United States, especially the B-10 in 1932. This is seen in the RAF adoption of the Handley Page Heyford as a night bomber, its last biplane heavy bomber. It first flew in June 1930, entered service in 1933, and left front-line duties in 1939.The RAF procured three twin-engine bombers to bridge the gap between these older types and modern heavy bombers. All three, the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley, Handley Page Hampden, and Vickers Wellington, first flew
