ed three twin-engine bombers to bridge the gap between these older types and modern heavy bombers. All three, the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley, Handley Page Hampden, and Vickers Wellington, first flew in 1936, entered service late in the decade, fought the early battles, and served until 1942-43, when the RAF's four-engine bombers arrived. Disastrous daylight, unescorted bomb- ing missions quickly demonstrated how unprepared Bomber Command was for war. On three missions in September 1939, the British lost twenty-five of sixty-four bombers. These operations revealed the Germans had adequate defenses against unescorted day attacks even around its periphery. In contrast, Bomber Command Hitler's rise to power and the remili- tarization of Germany changed the balance of power in Europe and led to a general rearmament. The British effort was aimed at obtaining parity in air power as a deterrent to Germany. By late 1937 these plans called  CHAPTER 4 BRITISH STRATEGIC BOMBING was deficient in numbers, aircraft, equip- ment, tactics, training, and plans-just about everything except courage and determina- tion. Bombers burned easily, were poorly defended by their .303-caliber machine guns, used inadequate bombsights, lacked self-sealing fuel tanks, had no navigational aids, dropped inefficient bombs, and flew loose formations. At the same time night leaflet missions operated over the Continent with few losses. (Between May 9 and June 4, 1940, the RAF flew 1,700 night sorties and lost thirty-nine aircraft, a 2.3 percent loss rate, compared with 856 day sorties and a loss of fifty-six bombers, 6.5 percent.) As a consequence Bomber Command turned to night bombing. The British carefully chose their targets, fearing German retaliation. (In late April the vice chief of the Air Staff, Richard Peirse, noted that it would be foolhardy to provoke a German response because the GAF could deliver a blow four times greater than Bomber Command.) Events quickly changed the RAF's position. On
