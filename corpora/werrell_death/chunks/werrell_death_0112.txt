western Ger- many. In December 1940 the British Minis- try of Information opined that the Germans could not take one-quarter of the bombing that the British had withstood. Apparently more than the propagandists believed this, for in July 1941 both the British Foreign Office and prime minister were forceful proponents of bombing civilians.2 The Air Staff concluded that different methods were required for city attacks. A comparison of photographs of British and German towns bombed by approximately equal numbers of bombers indicated much greater damage inflicted by the GAF.A September 1941 memo attributed this to the greater proportion of incendiaries car- ried by the Luftwaffe bombers. In addition German bombs were more powerful, pound for pound, than British bombs.3 Bomber Command adapted. In September 1941 the RAF sent a plan to Churchill that called for the total destruc- tion of forty-three German cities with a population of fifteen million people, requir- ing four thousand bombers and six months. Churchill, despite his support of morale bombing and Bomber Command, was very skeptical of such claims. During World War I, as already noted, Churchill rejected the idea "that any terrorization of the civil popula- tion which could be achieved by air attack would compel the Government of a great nation to surrender."4 Nevertheless, Britain, fighting alone and on the defensive, decided to make the commitment to a major bomb- ing offensive. Although the RAF espoused preci- sion bombing, it certainly had considered attacking German morale. In the fall of 1940 both the prime minister and commander of Bomber Command discussed retaliatory bombing of German towns in response to indiscriminate German bombing, a conver- sation that raised issues of feasibility, desir- ability, and morality. The Air Staff believed that morale along with transport were German weak points. British experience with the bombing of London should have given the decision makers pause concerning bombing t
