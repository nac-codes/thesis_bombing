dispatches as "yet another occasion when a Commander in the field was over-ruled at the dictation of junior staff officers in the Air Ministry."10 Instead of one Pathfinder unit, Harris wanted each group to have such an organization as tried toward the end of the war.11 Harris had little interest in such a scheme and no use for the concept of precision bombing or, in his words, attacking panacea targets, because he aimed to devastate urban areas. New Tactics Better navigational aids along with improved German defenses encouraged Bomber Command to modify its tactics. The unit pressed for concentration of bombers on their routing as well as over the targets, tactics to counter German linear defenses by flooding German radar and antiaircraft artillery (AAA) units. These advantages outweighed the risks of collision, friendly fire (be it machine guns or falling bombs), and greater vulnerability to interceptors. In March 1942 Bomber Command made a major tactical change with a tactic (Shaker) consisting of aircraft dropping illumina- tion to guide in bombers that placed target markers for the main force that followed. Improved target marker flares become operational in January 1943; later the RAF used air markers. Despite the use of these tactics and Gee, success was illusive. The men of the Pathfinder Force sup- posedly were selected for their abilities, although, according to the official history, "it remains doubtful whether they were always the best crews which Bomber Command had to offer."12 In addition the Pathfinders never had priority in equipment. This was dangerous work because these men were to fly an extended tour of sixty missions and as the vanguard of the bombing raids would be first in. One major innovation instituted by Bomber Command was to organize the Pathfinder Force, which led RAF bombing raids and played a major role in increasing bombing accuracy. The idea of forming a unit of select crews emerged as early as February 1941, and the Shaker tactics a
