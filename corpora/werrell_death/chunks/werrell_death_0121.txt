etting the force in and out as quickly as possible. In October 1943 compressing the time over the target was "drastically stepped up." Bomber Command made other improvements that increased its impact. The British learned that German bombs packed more punch than theirs due to bet- ter explosives and a greater proportion of explosive resulting from lighter bomb cases. This was remedied and the RAF went on to drop heavier conventional bombs than any other air force, putting into combat a 4,000- pound bomb ("block buster") in March 1941, an 8,000-pound bomb in April 1942, the 12,000-pound "Tallboy" in summer 1944, and the 22,000-pound "Grand Slam" in March 1945. The British also put a better bombsight into its bombers beginning in September 1942. Another basic change was Bomber Command's reorganization of the bomber crew in early 1942, reducing it from two pilots to one, which certainly eased their training and staffing problem. Two new positions were added: navigator and bom- bardier (bomb aimer). 13 The increasing importance of ECM and growing size and weight of airborne equipment led the RAF to dedicate aircraft strictly to jamming and form a specialized unit with this responsibility. It flew its first ECM mission in November 1943, although the unit did not hit its stride until after the June 1944 Normandy invasion. Britain's Other Heavy Bombers In addition to electronics, Bomber Com- mand also used various tactics to complicate the defender's task. To deceive the night fighters the British used diversionary forces, marked cities other than the target, and employed evasive routing. Mosquito bomb- ers were especially important in these efforts The heavy bomber identified with Bomber Command's air offensive against Germany is quite rightly the Lancaster, but until it appeared in 1942, the RAF used twin- engine medium bombers and two other aircraft, the four-engine Stirling and Halifax. The Short Stirling is remembered at best as  CHAPTER 4 BRITISH STRATEGIC BOMBING 00
