later. This attack was a daring move by Harris because he had to employ large numbers of crews in operational training units to muster the 1,046 bombers that he dispatched. Almost 900 bombers flew through foul weather to find conditions over the target clear (Hamburg was the first choice, but weather intervened), where they dropped fifteen hundred tons of bombs, two-thirds of them incendiaries. They did this in an hour and a half, a remarkable effort and improvement over previous attacks. The bombing damaged six hundred acres, much more damage than inflicted on the previous fourteen hundred sorties against the city, and almost equaling the total (seven hundred acres) damage inflicted on German cities thus far in the war. The bombing destroyed about one month's worth of production. Bomber Command lost 3.8 percent (forty bombers) of the aircraft dispatched compared to an average loss rate of 4.6 percent dur- ing the previous year's attacks on western Germany. Although the Cologne mission was a major Bomber Command victory, it was a showpiece that could not be eas- ily replicated. In June Bomber Command launched 956 bombers against Essen and 904 against Bremen, both unsuccessful attacks. The next largest raid of the year was against Dusseldorf in July, and that force of 630 was not exceeded until May 1943. Postwar stud- ies reveal that the 1942 bombing had little impact on the German economy. Neverthe- less the attack on Cologne indicated the power and potential of Bomber Command, sparked British morale, encouraged the Soviets, and impressed the Americans. Atypical Bomber Command Operations Bomber Command burnished its record for daring, courage, and efficiency with a number of low-level daylight attacks dur- ing the war. Most were small in scale and tactical, some were costly, and many were unsuccessful. Only a few merit attention as strategic strikes. The most famous Bomber Command low-level attack, probably the outstanding British operation of the war, 85 and among
