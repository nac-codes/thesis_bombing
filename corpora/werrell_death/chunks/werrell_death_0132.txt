materials to repair the damage and increase the defenses of the dam system. However, damage was limited to a small agrarian area for a brief time. It was too ambi- tious because the airmen lacked the force to destroy the other dams that could have caused widespread and serious economic damage. Therefore the dam missions were more spectacular than significant, daring but not decisive, costly without real effect, bringing to mind one of the observations of the charge of the light brigade at Balaklava during the Crimean War:"It is magnificent, but it is not war." A large explosive, detonated in a specific location is required to destroy a dam. Barnes Wallis, the inventor of the geodetic design, developed a large bouncing (or skip- ping) bomb designed to hit the dam's up water side and then roll down the face and explode beneath the water's surface, which would have a tamping effect on the explo- sion. To accurately deliver the 9,300-pound weapon, the crew had to fly an exact speed, straight and level at very low altitude (sixty feet above the reservoir's surface), and release the munition at 400 to 450 yards from the target ... at night. Bomber Command timed the attack for mid-May to capitalize on the best moon conditions, the highest reservoir level, and the longer nights before summer. Bomber Command employed Lancast- ers on other precision bombing missions. On September 15, 1943, 617 Squadron dispatched eight Lancasters to break the walls of the Dortmund-Ems canal with 12,000-pound bombs dropped from 150 feet. The bank held; five bombers failed to return. In a similar fashion Lancasters failed The RAF employed modified Lancasters and organized the 617 Squadron specifically  CHAPTER 4 BRITISH STRATEGIC BOMBING to drop the Antheor viaduct on September 16, 1943 (one of six low-flying bombers was lost) and on November 11, 1943, when ten Lancasters attacked (and all survived). A third attack on the viaduct on February 12, 1944, met tough defenses and also failed to take
