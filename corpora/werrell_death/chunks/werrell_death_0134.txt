st. These low-level precision-bombing missions, although they sometimes achieved spectacular tactical results, yielded question- able strategic results. The RAF launched its most skilled, most experienced, and prob- ably bravest crews on daring missions, which they sometimes accomplished but mostly at a frightful cost. The strategic air war would be fought, and won, by other means. Bomber Command Swings into High Gear It was not until 1943, more than three years after the war's onset, that Bomber Command began to make itself felt. New aircraft, improved equipment, and increasing numbers gave the unit greater capabili- ties, which would only improve as the war continued. This increased capability was first seen in the campaign against the Ruhr, the German industrial heartland. The official history described it as not just one successful attack but "a whole series of consistent and pulverizing blows among which the failures were much rarer than the successes."21 The Mosquito was key to the suc- cess over the Ruhr. It proved essentially invulnerable to German defenses and, fitted with Oboe, provided target marking that improved bombing accuracy. The initial attack of the campaign on March 5 against Essen illustrates the aircraft's importance and the basic pattern of Bomber Com- mand attacks during the remainder of the 87 war. The assault began when Oboe-guided Mosquitoes dropped red target indicator bombs on the aiming point backed up by heavy bombers of the Pathfinder Force, which dropped green target indicator bombs. The main force of three overlapping waves of bombers, first Halifaxes, then Wel- lingtons and Stirlings, and finally Lancasters, dropped 1,015 tons of bombs, two-thirds of them incendiaries, with one-third of the high explosives fused for long delay. The outstanding feature of the tactic was that visual observation was not involved. Raid and postraid photographs indicated that of the 422 aircraft dispatched, 153 bombers released their bombs within three
