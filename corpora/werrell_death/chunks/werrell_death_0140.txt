Command made thirty-three major thrusts against Germany. These attacks were distinguished from the earlier ones by the increased num- bers of bombers (from five hundred to six  CHAPTER 4 BRITISH STRATEGIC BOMBING Berlin was a difficult target. Besides its stout defenses, it was shielded by its geog- raphy (a round trip of 1,150 miles rendered Oboe ineffective), the notorious European winter weather, and its sprawling nature (which largely neutered radar navigation and bomb aiming). And despite Harris's hopes for American assistance in the campaign against Berlin, the AAF would not engage the German capital until March 1944. presented the flak gunners with many more opportunities. (The British estimated that more than fifty bombers fell to German AAA.) And then Bomber Command suf- fered its worst defeat of the war. On March 30, 1944, Bomber Command 91 Aided by poor weather, in late 1943, Bomber Command was able to get to Berlin and other German targets with suc- cess and bearable losses, in November and December losing respectively 3.1 and 4.1 percent of those dispatched on night attacks. The new year brought an increasing butcher bill. In January 1944 Bomber Command listed 314 bombers missing, the most for any month of the war, and 5 percent of those dispatched. The loss rate for six Berlin raids was 6.1 percent and 7.2 percent for three attacks on other German cities. The overall loss rate declined slightly in February to 4.7 percent, although against Leipzig on the twentieth, Bomber Command lost 9.5 percent (seventy-eight aircraft). launched 795 aircraft against Nuremberg. Everything went wrong. The routing can be criticized for a straight leg of almost 250 miles, while poor weather condi- tions over the North Sea prevented any extensive diversionary missions. This was essentially a head-on assault. The weather made matters worse: clear skies on the inbound route and conditions that produced contrails, presenting ideal conditions for the interceptors. There was n
