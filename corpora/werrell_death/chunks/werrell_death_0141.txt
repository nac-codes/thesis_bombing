as essentially a head-on assault. The weather made matters worse: clear skies on the inbound route and conditions that produced contrails, presenting ideal conditions for the interceptors. There was no master bomber. The result was, in the words of the official historian, "Bomber Command suffered the ill consequences of unusually bad luck and uncharacteristically bad and unimaginative operational planning."26 The enemy defenses and unpredicted winds scattered the bomb- ers so that only a few reached their target and these inflicted little damage. "Vigour, courage, resolve and endeavour" could not overcome poor planning, unfavorable weather, and tough German defenses. The Germans claimed 132 bombers destroyed, when in fact they downed 95, mostly by night fighters.27 Bomber Command lost as many men on this one raid as Fighter Com- mand had in the entire Battle of Britain. diluted aircrew experience and undercut morale. In addition the damage inflicted was not on the scale achieved during the earlier Ruhr and Hamburg campaigns. The official history notes that in contrast to these earlier campaigns, where new technologies and tactics were introduced, Oboe and Mos- quito marking in the Ruhr and Window and radar at Hamburg, the Berlin campaign saw no major innovations. Bomber Com- mand did make one tactical improvement by compressing its bombers over the target. While in the Cologne bombing of May 1942 the unit got twelve bombers over the target a minute, by mid-November this rate had doubled. Bomber Command had destroyed at least 2,250 acres of Berlin, killed about ten thousand Germans, and lost more than five hundred aircraft, yet it had failed to knock Germany out of the war. It had flown ninety-one hundred sorties on sixteen major raids and dropped thirty thousand tons of bombs, with a loss rate of 5.4 percent that increased to 6.5 percent when unrepairable bombers were included. This war was far from over, for by the end of March 1944 Bomber Command had dropped only
