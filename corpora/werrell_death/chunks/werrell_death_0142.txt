bombs, with a loss rate of 5.4 percent that increased to 6.5 percent when unrepairable bombers were included. This war was far from over, for by the end of March 1944 Bomber Command had dropped only one- quarter of its total wartime tonnage. Bomber Command was spared for the moment as bombsights shifted to easier targets in France when the overall Allied priority became preparation for the Normandy invasion. The Luftwaffe had won the battle for air supe- riority at night. Just as the Americans had been taught months earlier over Schwein- furt, over Nuremberg the British learned the cost of not having air superiority. British heavy bombers were easy prey for German fighters. They were less maneuverable, lighter armed than the fight- ers, and over time their armor had been removed. Because they were unable to outfight the interceptors, they flew alone at night, shielded by the dark and electronic countermeasures; however, they could be detected visually by the telltale trail of their engines and sometimes contrails, and from their electronic emissions. In brief the heavy bombers were "outpaced, outmanoeuvred by the German night fighters and in a generally highly inflammable and explosive condition, these black monsters presented an ideal target to any fighter pilot who could find them."28 By early 1944 British bombers could no longer evade the fighters at night. The Rise and Fall of German Night Defenses Prior to the war the Germans believed that flak alone would suffice for air defense, a belief reinforced by German AAA perfor- mance in the Spanish Civil War. World War II proved somewhat different. In June 1939 the Luftwaffe organized its first night fighter unit and equipped it with twin-engine Me 110s and Ju 88Cs. Initially the Germans employed ground radio control and search- lights, but then in October 1940 they estab- lished a more sophisticated system. The GAF organized zones (or boxes) west of the Ruhr covered by radar known as the Kammhuber Line, named after
