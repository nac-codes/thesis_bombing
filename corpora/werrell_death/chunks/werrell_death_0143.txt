d search- lights, but then in October 1940 they estab- lished a more sophisticated system. The GAF organized zones (or boxes) west of the Ruhr covered by radar known as the Kammhuber Line, named after General Josef Kammhu- ber, commander of the night fighters. By the end of 1942 the defensive line was thirty kilometers wide and extended from the northern tip of Denmark to the southeast of Paris, some nine hundred kilometers. By the beginning of 1943 the number of night Although the loss rate declined in March to 3.1 percent, in that month the battle was lost, at least for the moment. By the end of that month Bomber Command shifted its aim away from Berlin to targets in southern Germany, dispersing attacks, and using more diversionary efforts. The reason for this was simply that the defenses had overwhelmed the offensive. The March 24, 1944, attack on Berlin cost seventy-two bombers missing (9.1 percent), primarily due to unforeseen winds that dispersed the bomber stream, gave the night fighters problems, but Bomber Command had been defeated. In the twenty-six months between Febru- ary 1942 and March 1944 the overall loss rate was 3.8 percent; however, between November 18, 1943, and March 31, 1944, Bomber Command lost 1,050 bombers, 5.2 percent of those dispatched. These losses  CHAPTER 4 BRITISH STRATEGIC BOMBING fighters increased from 400 to 500, then to 775 by mid-1943. Their impact increased, accounting in 1942 for just under half of the night bombers destroyed, rising in 1943 to almost two-thirds. Consequently the Luftwaffe night defense became increasingly more effective, downing 2 percent of the sorties dispatched by Bomber Command in 1940, 2.6 percent in 1941, and 3.9 percent in 1942. In the first half of 1943 the missing rate was 3.8 percent. Another means the GAF used to combat the British bombers was to form an intruder unit in mid-1940 consisting of a small num- ber of Ju 88s and Do 17s. These attacked the bombers over Britain where they were most vulner
