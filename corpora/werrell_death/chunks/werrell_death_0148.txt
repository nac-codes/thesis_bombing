pieces. An Interlude in Strategic Bombing 95 Allied airmen received a mild reprieve beginning in early 1944 and extending through the fall of 1944 with the shifting of targets from Germany to those in the occu- pied countries of Western Europe. While in 1943 half of the total British and American bomb tonnage fell on Germany, for the first nine months of 1944 that figure fell to a quarter, and for the period April through August, it fell to a fifth. As already noted, some of this involved bombing the launch- ing sites ofV-weapons, while the other major alternative target set was connected with the cross-Channel assault. For two and a half months prior to D day and three and a half months after that, Allied air power focused on hitting continental targets to enable a successful invasion and then permit a breakout from the beach head. These tar- gets were in France and the Low Countries, required a shorter penetration of enemy air space, and faced lighter opposition than those flown against German targets. There were of course losses, but not on the scale endured on the deep raids into the German heartland. The strategic air war did not resume in full force until October. The Oil Campaign Bomber Command knew that the Germans were short of oil and had assigned it the number one target priority, a position it retained until July 1941. Other target sets and operational difficulties led to it being downgraded. The early years of the war saw the German oil position improve as the Nazis obtained Polish and Rumanian oil and increased synthetic oil production. After achieving a peak stockpile of oil in the sum- mer of 1940, German consumption, produc- tion, and stocks remain essentially in balance until the fall of 1943, after which stocks rose to a peak (since 1941) by April 1944. Although the strategic bombing between April and September 1944 period focused on supporting the ground forces, the AAF began a concerted effort against oil begin- ning in April, an effort relucta
