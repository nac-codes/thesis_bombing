British press and in the House of Commons. Churchill composed a message for the British chiefs of staff that the "bombing of German cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror . . should be reviewed," for it was not in British interests to occupy a ruined land. "The destruction of Dresden," Churchill wrote, "remains a serious query against the conduct of Allied bombing."The prime minister continued: "I feel the need for more precise concentration upon military objectives, such as oil and communica- tions behind the immediate battle-zone, rather than on mere acts of terror and wanton destruction, however impressive."31 The RAF hotly resented and rejected this critical note and it was withdrawn within days, replaced by a less strident one. In it Churchill deleted the quoted material cited above and called for a review of area bomb- ing considering Britain's long term interests.  CHAPTER 4 Chapter 5 U.S. Strategic Bombing in Europe DAY BOMBING One key was to cut off coal mined in the Ruhr from the rest of Germany. Bomber Command attacks reduced canal traffic to a trickle by fall 1944 and rail movement to a lesser extent. The result seriously reduced coal coming out of the Ruhr and ore going into it, consequently steel production plum- meted and coal required for rail transport fell short, and by the end of March 1945 the Ruhr was separated from the rest of Germany. (However, this was only a week before ground forces accomplished the same goal.) The communications bombing reduced production and hindered weapons from reaching the troops. Communications, Transportation, and Coal German communications were vital to both the German economy and military. In plan- ning for the cross-Channel invasion these became entangled. An attack on commu- nications would serve tactical and strategic ends, and both the tactical and strategic air forces could engage in the campaign. This effort went forward despite the resistance of the British and American bomber com- manders, the
