The great powers of the world began to rearm during the early and mid-1930s, an action America did not follow until January 1938. When the Euro- pean war exploded in September 1939, the United States declared neutrality. The nation wanted to stay out of the war yet favored the Allies and sold them military equip- ment. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the German declaration of war thrust the United States directly into the war. The United States was ill prepared for war, although the airmen did have a plan. In response to President Franklin Roosevelt's request for overall production requirements, in one week in the summer of 1941 six graduates of the Air Corps Tactical School wrote AWPD/1 (Air War Plans Division), which called for sixty thousand combat air- craft for the AAF (the Air Corps became the Army Air Forces in June 1941) and 2.2 mil- lion men. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, however, the AAF had fewer than three hundred heavy bombers in fourteen heavy bombardment groups of the seventy tactical groups it had activated. AWPD/1 went beyond production requests and was a remarkably accurate projection of how the war would be fought. For example, it forecast that because of the time required for training and production, an all-out offensive could not be launched before April 1944. It specified 154 key precision bombing targets in four systems (electric power, transporta- tion, oil, and morale) and highlighted the Luftwaffe as an intermediate objective that had to be neutralized to allow successful bombing operations. The plan also suggested immediate efforts to develop a long-range escort fighter. The airmen held out the 99  CHAPTER 5 U.S. STRATEGIC BOMBING IN EUROPE pr
