o the large signature "big tail," which permitted the addition of a tail gun position and increased stabil- ity, especially at high altitudes. Boeing also added powered top and belly turrets armed with twin .50-caliber machine guns, a gun mounted in the radio compartment (firing upward and aft), one gun on each side in the open waist positions, and two .30-caliber machines guns in the nose. Although the "E" was seven tons heavier than the first Fort, it was capable of reaching 317 mph and was the first model used by the AAF in the European war beginning in August 1942. The "F" model went into European combat in January 1943 and looked and was very much the same as the "E," although later bombers in that series had increased fuel capacity. The last big change came in the "G" model, which entered combat in late 1943, the last and most numerous (eighty- seven hundred built) of the Forts. Boeing mounted a chin turret with twin .50-caliber machine guns to counter the very effec- tive GAF head-on attacks, improved the tail armament, and staggered and enclosed the waist positions. The AAF had a peak of 4,600 Forts in August 1944, and by the end of August 1945 the AAF had accepted 12,700 B-17s. The Forts dropped almost 60 percent of the bombs delivered by American heavy bombers in Europe. The B-17's teammate was the Con- solidated B-24 Liberator. It has been overshadowed by the more photogenic, better publicized, more loved, and well  CHAPTER 5 102 U.S. STRATEGIC BOMBING IN EUROPE known Fortress, and thus "the boxcar with wings" has been largely underappreciated. It deserves better, for more B-24s were built than any other American aircraft in history (18,200) and it proved more versatile than the B-17, serving in bomber, maritime reconnaissance, and transport roles. At its peak in September 1944 just over six thou- sand Libs were in AAF colors, and at their maximum overseas strength the AAF had thirty-three B-17 groups (September 1944) and forty-six B-24 groups (June 1944)
