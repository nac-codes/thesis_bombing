models were armed with a nose turret mounting twin .50s. More "J" models were built (sixty- seven hundred) than any other version. The Mighty Eighth In early 1942 the AAF established the Eighth Air Force as a balanced unit to support the European invasion. In short order, however, it was redirected toward strategic bombardment operations, although it employed medium bombers until Octo- ber 1943. The Americans were confident, overconfident as it turned out, despite British experience, skepticism, reserva- tions, and opposition. "I know that our crews, equipment, and training will be far AAF operations out of Britain took some time to begin and only slowly built up in size and effectiveness. It can not be overem- phasized how much the Americans relied on the British for a wide range of assistance, extending from airfields and supplies to intelligence and food. Initial operations con- sisted of heavily escorted short-range raids of targets in occupied Western Europe begin- ning in August 1942, when a dozen B-17s hit a French marshaling yard at Rouen. Eaker flew on the attack, as did AAF leaders on occasion.4 GAF fighters engaged the bombers and their Spitfire escort and dam- aged two bombers. The airmen considered the bombing good, although only one-third of the bombs fell within two thousand feet of the aiming point. Mission number 14 on October 9 against Lille was notable as being the first comprised of more than 100 bombers, the first with B-24s, and the first fierce air bat- tle. The results were not heartening, as only 69 of the 108 bombers dispatched bombed the primary target and accuracy was poor. The photo interpreters could identify only half of the bombs dropped and concluded that a mere 3 percent of these hit within fifteen hundred feet of the aiming point. 105 In addition, a number of the bombs were duds and others caused French casualties. The discouraging performance was blamed on inexperience-one-quarter of the crews were flying their first combat missi
