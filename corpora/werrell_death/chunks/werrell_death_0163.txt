In addition, a number of the bombs were duds and others caused French casualties. The discouraging performance was blamed on inexperience-one-quarter of the crews were flying their first combat mission-and the weather. The air battle resulted in the loss of four bombers and damage to forty others. The bomber gunners claimed fifty-six GAF fighters destroyed and the escort- ing fighters another five. These claims were immediately suspect because the number was a sizable portion of the estimated Luftwaffe strength in the West. American reassessments reduced this figure to twenty-one destroyed while German sources indicate a loss of only two fighters. The issues of high victory claims and low admissions of losses were problems throughout the war and plague researchers to this day. The AAF attempted to accurately gauge these claims, tightening up the criteria for awarding credits, ever mind- ful of the impact on intelligence estimates and aircrew morale. A reassessment in early January 1943 reduced the previous overall figure of 223 GAF fighters destroyed to 89. Nevertheless, German records indicate that even this figure was too high. airmen did recognize there were problems, the most serious of which were inadequate training and the weather. These difficulties were compounded by three outside events. The newly opened North Africa theater (Operation Torch) drained off bombers and fighters and, even more significant, the Eighth's longest range fighters (P-38s) and the most experienced bomber crews. A second problem was that the Eighth was not getting adequate rein- forcements because heavy bomber units were being sent to the North African and Pacific theaters. The number of heavy bombers fully operational and crews available in Britain did not reach the two hundred mark until April 1943, four hundred in August, and seven hundred in November. The third difficulty emerged when antisubmarine operations were granted top priority in late October 1942, a position held until Ju
