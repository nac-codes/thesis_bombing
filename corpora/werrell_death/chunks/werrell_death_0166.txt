the Mediterranean would be confined to knocking Italy out of the war. They also directed that the Ploesti oil fields be hit as soon as possible. The Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO) plan listed fighters as the intermediate objective; submarines, the remaining aircraft industry, ball bearings, and oil as primary objectives; and rubber and mili- tary transport vehicles as secondary objectives. It can be argued that greater concentra- tion on the sea war, particularly mari- time reconnaissance and less on strategic bombing, would have yielded better results, sooner, with less cost. Likewise it can be argued that the Allies would have profited more from greater emphasis on tactical (close air support and interdiction) than on strategic bombing. For that matter it can be argued that the U.S. ground offensive would have benefited from more landing craft, better tanks, and higher quality leadership from the resources absorbed by the strategic air war. But these hypotheticals must be weighed against what the strategic air war accomplished, as will be described. Meanwhile in late 1942 there were uncertainties at the highest level concern- ing the conduct of the war, as well as the conduct of strategic bombing. The RAF continued to press the Americans to join them in night bombing, a move strenu- ously opposed by the AAF although it held a weak hand, for after a year of war, the Eighth's numbers were small and it had not yet bombed Germany. At the Casablanca Conference in early 1943, Eaker successfully made the case for the U.S. concept directly to Churchill; the British and American leaders agreed to a British night and an American daylight bombardment campaign against Germany, "around the clock bomb- ing" (Eaker's phrase). The culmination was a document issued by the Combined Chiefs of Staff on January 21, 1943, that called for "the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial and economic In early 1943 Eaker adapted an opera- tional plan based
