me standard for the remain- der of the war. In January 1943 some formations began to drop their bombs on the signal of the lead bombardier, a change that brought both defensive and offensive advantages. The Eighth could not employ each bombsight and bombardier for bombing because this would loosen the formation on the bomb run and weaken the bombers' defensive capabilities. And as the nose position was too cramped to permit both the nose gun and bombsight to be manned simultaneously, 109 freeing up the gunner on the bomb run increased forward firepower. Group bomb- ing also had offensive advantages. Operations analysis concluded that of bomb-aiming methods tried by the Eighth, the group- leader technique was twice as effective as the next best method and therefore it became the standard practice by the second quarter of 1943.12 By this time the airmen were also using automatic flight control equip- ment (AFCE), which linked the bombsight directly to the aircraft's autopilot, allowing the bombardier to make rapid and smooth corrections in the critical last moments before bomb release. The AAF had to over- come initial problems of maintenance and acceptance of this device, but outstanding results led to its standard use by May 1943. Although accuracy figures are especially questionable because only a percentage of the bombs dropped could be identified, the Eighth believed that visual bombing accu- racy in the last quarter of 1943 was double that of the first three-quarters of the year. mission required about fifty to sixty tons of aluminum. Initially Chaff was dumped by hand out of the bombers, but then in October 1944 the Eighth sent bombers and fighters ahead of the formation to drop the device in order to shield the forma- tions. Later the airmen installed machines to automatically dispense Chaff, and in May 1945 it was dropped in bomb casings. In October 1943 the AAF first used Carpet, an electronic jammer that reduced flak damage by one-fifth. The first versions
