losses, 29 bombers missing and 3 salvaged. (Of 14 bombers dispatched by the unlucky 100th "Bloody Hundredth" Bomb Group, only 2 returned home, 1 with two engines out and another crash landing.) The bomber crews claimed to have downed 182 GAF fighters and escorting fighter pilots claimed another 21; German records admit losing 25 fighters in combat that day. The Schweinfurt raid of 230 Forts, led by its commander, Brig. Gen. Robert Wil- liams, met even tougher resistance.17 One reason was that fighters the Germans shifted westward for the anticipated return of the 4th were in excellent position to meet the 1st's effort. The unit did not bomb as well as the Regensburg force due in part to the defenses, bombing three thousand feet higher than usual, and congestion on the bomb run. Nevertheless, production in Schweinfurt in September and October was cut by one-third. Despite these losses the AAF persisted and continued to be savaged by GAF defenses and thwarted by the weather. On a September 6 mission against ball bearing plants in Stuttgart, weather allowed only 46 of 338 bombers to (poorly) bomb the target. The Eighth encountered fewer than two hundred fighters, yet the German defense along with the range and weather resulted in forty-five bombers lost in action, five interned in Switzerland, and three written off as wrecks. Weather again upset the airmen's plans. Fifteen minutes prior to the 4th Wing's taxi time, the Eighth's acting commander, Brig. Gen. Frederick Anderson, was told that his bases were weathered in. Anderson delayed the 4th's movement as long as possible (ninety minutes) to enable it to get to Africa before dusk. The 4th got off, but the weather at the 1st's bases remained too poor for take- off.15 Anderson decided to launch the 4th separately because of the importance of the target, the fickle weather, and the fear that the recent raids would encourage the Luft- waffe to reinforce its Regensburg defenses. He also decided to send the 1st Wing out th
