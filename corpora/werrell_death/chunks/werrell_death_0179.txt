target must be destroyed. It is of vital importance to the enemy. Your friends and comrades that have been lost and that will be lost today are depending on you. This sacrifice must not be in vain. Good luck, good shooting, and good bombing.18 The Eighth launched 321 bombers, all but 29 of which were B-17s. The weather was similar to that of August 17, but the better trained pilots were able to assembly without grave difficulties. The Germans changed their tactics and engaged the escorting P-47s  CHAPTER 5 U.S. STRATEGIC BOMBING IN EUROPE not to bomb. While the AAF planned to bomb visually and is known for this, 40 percent of the bombs dropped by U.S. heavy bombers in Europe were aimed by non- visual methods. To be clear, AAF accuracy with this method was far less than with visual bombing, and less than that achieved by the RAF. Nonvisual bombing techniques allowed the AAF to bomb more often and indirectly enact attrition on the defenders; however, they were both inaccurate and indiscriminate, raising efficiency and moral- ity issues. gained its fame in the Pacific theater. The P-47 Republic Thunderbolt was large, heavy, and very tough. It was heavily armed with eight .50s, fast in a dive, and available early in 1943, when it was needed. It did well in the air-to-air combat but was overshadowed by the more photogenic and better performing P-51. Overlooked is the fact that prior to April 1944, by which time the AAF had won the air superiority battle, the Republic fighter claimed three-fifths of GAF aircraft downed by the two fighters. The third and most important factor in the turnaround in the air war proved to be the addition of the long-range fighter escort. The American airmen had considered this not only technologically impossible, a view held by other airmen as well, but theoretically unnecessary. Two points deserve emphasis: The provision of long-range escort was the key to the Allied aerial victory and the Americans did what both the Germans and British fail
