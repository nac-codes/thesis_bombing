ll, but theoretically unnecessary. Two points deserve emphasis: The provision of long-range escort was the key to the Allied aerial victory and the Americans did what both the Germans and British failed to do. The Eighth introduced three fighters in the strategic air war against Germany, the P-47 in early 1943, the P-38 in October, and the P-51 in December.23 The Lockheed P-38 Lightning was fast, could outturn GAF fighters, and had a superior combat radius. However, it was initially hindered by engine cooling and cockpit heating and defrosting problems. It also lacked the diving ability and ruggedness of the P-47, had an inferior rate of roll, and, with its twin booms and engines, was easily identified, unlike its teammates, which could be mistaken for German fighters. It was not as well regarded as a fighter in the European war, as were the P-47 and P-51, and instead The North American Mustang design was prompted by the British, neglected by the Americans, and developed outside the normal AAF channels, similar to the RAF's Mosquito. (That two of the war's outstand- ing aircraft were so developed is certainly a comment on the system.) It languished with its inferior U.S. power plant until the Allies mated its magnificent airframe with the equally outstanding Rolls Royce Merlin engine. The resulting fighter could outperform the P-47, P-38, Spitfire, and, most important, any conventional Luftwaffe fighter, making it the best piston-powered fighter of the war. Its most important attribute was its range, yet it was belat- edly deployed as an escort fighter due to the high command's failure to appreciate both the problem and the aircraft. The AAF did not see the need and urgency until mid-1943, and it was not until June that Arnold firmly demanded long-range escort fighters and that the Eighth ordered large- scale production of drop tanks. As late as the fall of 1943 Eaker allowed all P-51s to be assigned to the AAF ground support air force, and it was not until January
