t in the battle for air superiority. One of the first changes made by the new Eighth Air Force commander, Jimmy Doolittle, in January 1945 was to revoke the existing escort policy, which tied the fighters closely to their charges. This violated standard AAF policy and was unpopular with bomber crews, who liked seeing friendly fight- ers close at hand, but it gave the American fighter pilots the initiative, which they eagerly and effectively exploited. Pilot aggressiveness was further encouraged by granting victory credits for aircraft destroyed on the ground and adopting a policy allowing returning escort fighters to strafe enemy targets, especially airfields. Low-level tactics were costly, and some question the wisdom of using expensive machines and skilled pilots against parked aircraft and much cheaper flak.25 It bears repeating that the GAF lost air superiority due to a lack of experienced pilots, not a lack of aircraft. A month earlier Hermann Goering, the The Eighth licked its wounds after the October setbacks and over the next three months limited its operations to targets in western Germany and the Western European occupied countries. The Eighth launched it next major mission consist- ing of 593 heavy bombers on January 11, 1944, against five aircraft factories in central Germany. Because of the weather, only a third of the force launched bombed its primary objectives, with good to excellent results, while the other bombers hit targets of opportunity. The GAF countered with five hundred fighters that swept through the small P-51 escort in the target area and sav- aged the spread-out bombers. The Ameri- cans believed that the Luftwaffe defenses  CHAPTER 5 U.S. STRATEGIC BOMBING IN EUROPE had improved with the defenders staying in contact longer and adjusting to the bomb- ers' reaction, using rockets against the tight formation or pouncing on the bombers that dispersed to avoid the rockets. Sixty bombers went down and another two were written off for salvage.
