most important, might lead to the use of Siberian bases in the Pacific war. Difficult negotiations 123 and primitive infrastructure hindered the operation aptly code named Frantic. On June 2, 1944, Gen. Ira Eaker led a force from Italy consisting of 130 B-17s and 69 P-51s that hit railroad targets in Hungary on the eastward thrust and an airfield on the return four days later. On June 21 the Eighth launched more than 1,000 Forts, mainly against Berlin, including 147 bound for Russia that bombed a synthetic oil plant along the way. The Germans responded that night with about 150 twin-engine bomb- ers that hit Poltava, one of the three AAF bases in Russia. The GAF lost two bombers in their attack, which hit all seventy-three B-17s on the field, destroying forty-seven of them along with three C-47s, one P-38, and vast amounts of stores. The Russians beefed up their defenses and the missions continued, but without great success consid- ering the resources invested. The imaginative concept was undermined by the tardiness of its execution, reluctant Soviet cooperation, and the rapid Russian advance. the introduction of American long-range escort fighters came in time to ensure Allied air superiority for the Normandy invasion. Meanwhile the concurrent increased out- put of German fighters was rendered inef- fective by the decreased quality of Luftwaffe fighter pilots and the improved quality of Allied fighter pilots flying mounting quan- tities of superior propeller-powered fighters. The declining impact of the GAF fighter force obscures the improvement of German aircraft in the closing months of the war. The Eighth noted heavier fighter arma- ment and that the number of bomber losses increased relative to the number of fighters encountered. The biggest challenge to Allied air superiority in the closing months of the war was German rocket and jet-powered fighters. On August 5, 1944, three P-51s were quickly downed by three rocket- powered Me 163s. The delta-winged fighter
