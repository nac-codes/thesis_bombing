iles) increased projectile effectiveness. Nevertheless, flak proved disappointing to the defenders. Prior to the war the Germans estimated that on average forty-seven shells would down an aircraft while in fact it took more than eight thousand 88-mm, six thousand 105-mm, and three thousand 128-mm rounds, without the dual fuse. Flak was unable to halt Allied bombing or inflict prohibitive losses and damage, but it did create substantial losses and decrease bombing accuracy. The Germans attempted, and failed, to field two key antiaircraft innovations. The Americans introduced proximity fuses in the Pacific war in 1943 and against the V-1s in the European theater in mid-1944, a device that increased flak effectiveness by a factor of five. A postwar American study concluded that proximity fuses would have increased German flak efficiency by a factor of 3.4, making B-17 operations much more costly and B-24 operations impractical. The Germans also tested a number of flak rockets, later known as surface-to-air missiles Meanwhile German flak improved and accounted for the bulk of American aircraft losses during the war, especially after June 1944.33 GAF defenses were extensive, in February 1945 (months after their peak) consisting of 680 128-mm, 1,840 105- mm, and 9,300 88-mm guns. Almost one 125 (SAMs), but none saw combat. Proximity fuses fitted to rockets would have decimated the AAF's heavy bomber formations. with cutting edge technology, the romantic aura of aviation, and the spotlight of wartime publicity gave the airmen more credit than their actions merited. In any case the AAF's record in the war along with the potential of the newly developed atomic bomb bolstered the promise of strategic bombing in the future that led to the establishment of the U.S. Air Force (USAF) in 1947. The Results and Lessons of the Strategic Air War against Germany The Americans began a detailed evaluation of the bombing of Germany during the war that continued after the war and extended
