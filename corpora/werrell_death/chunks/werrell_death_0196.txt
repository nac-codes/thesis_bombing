in 1947. The Results and Lessons of the Strategic Air War against Germany The Americans began a detailed evaluation of the bombing of Germany during the war that continued after the war and extended to Japan. The United States Strategic Bomb- ing Survey (USSBS) employed hundreds of personnel to produce two hundred studies on the European war and one hundred on the Pacific war. The British undertook a similar project that was much smaller and relied on the USSBS for basic data. The investigators studied the bomb damage, researched enemy records, and interviewed captured officials. The USSBS remains the most extensive source on the subject. What did the strategic bombing accom- plish? The most important result was its contribution to the defeat of the Luftwaffe and winning air superiority. The Luftwaffe was significant in the German victories in the first years of the war. But GAF advantages eroded as the British and Soviets adapted to the air war and the Germans found themselves spread thin across Europe and North Africa. The strategic air war was instrumental in forcing the Germans to transition from an offensive air force to a defensive one. (In 1942 60 percent of the GAF's manpower and equipment was geared for offensive warfare, in 1944 82 per- cent was focused on homeland defense.) By January 1944 two-thirds of German fighters were located on the western front (as dis- tinct from the Russian and Mediterranean fronts) along with three-quarters of German heavy flak. The AAF began a concerted effort against German aviation plants in July 1943, yet this only amounted to 3.5 percent of the total tonnage it dropped during the war. German aircraft production increased during the war, peaking around March 1944 with acceptances peaking in July. Without the bombing, which caused direct destruc- tion as well as loss of production due to the dispersal effort, output would have been much higher. This understates the impact The overall conclusion of USSBS was that "Allied air
