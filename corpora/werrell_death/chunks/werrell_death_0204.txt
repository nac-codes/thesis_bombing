quality- control and schedule issues. The major technical issue involved inadequate engine cooling, partially a result of engine design and a tight engine cowling. The airmen employed a number of efforts to combat this problem, with eventual success; however, engine failures were common, responsible for half of all aborts and aircraft losses and damage in 1944. The B-29 engine aver- aged only 170 hours of service compared with 400 hours for the B-17 engine, which contributed to an abort rate three times that of the B-17. Engine failure was blamed for 28 percent of the accidents in the first five hundred B-29s, compared with 4 percent of the accidents in the first five hundred B-17s. The Superfort's engine problems frequently became engine fires. Between February 1943 and July 1945 the AAF attributed one-fifth of B-29 accidents to engine fires, four times the rate of fires in the B-17s and B-24s. To make matters 131 worse, the aircraft's fire extinguisher system proved ineffective. Little wonder the crews were wary of the B-29 and (at least in training) would abort missions for reasons that would be disregarded in other aircraft. This led to the bizarre suggestion that the bomber be configured with engines that could be jettisoned. A Unique Bombing Situation The airmen realized that the bombing of Japan would differ from the bombing situation in Europe. Observers noted that Japanese cities were very vulnerable to fire because of their density, the light construc- tion of their buildings, and the marginal fire- fighting capabilities of the Japanese, certainly compared with the Germans. This was made clear by the 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which killed some 110,000 people and destroyed one-fifth of the city's buildings. Billy Mitch- ell, novelists, and the Japanese wrote of the vulnerability of the country to fire, and some wrote of how a low tonnage of bombs would cause vast destruction and panic. These problems did not dissuade the AAF, which aggressively pushed the B-2
