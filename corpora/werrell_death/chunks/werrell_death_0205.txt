he vulnerability of the country to fire, and some wrote of how a low tonnage of bombs would cause vast destruction and panic. These problems did not dissuade the AAF, which aggressively pushed the B-29. One indication of the pressure to field the Superfortress is that the AAF ordered 1,650 before the aircraft's first flight in September 1942. Flight testing was hindered by engine problems, bad weather, a lack of facilities, and the crash of one of the experimental bombers. In early 1944 Arnold, frustrated by the continuing problems, exclaimed, "Is that airplane so damned rotten [that] they have to put it in cellophane?"4 The B-29's accident rate improved as the war continued but was considerably higher than the other AAF heavy bombers during the war.5 This Japanese vulnerability was offset, however, by a number of factors. First, Japan and the Pacific were seen as secondary to the European theater, where Germany was perceived as a more dangerous threat. Sec- ond, it was a major problem to bridge the vast Pacific Ocean, secure bases, and deliver bombs to Japan. Third, there was much less intelligence available on Japan than on Ger- many. Finally, and perhaps most important, the airmen believed in precision bombing. Building the B-29 was a complicated undertaking because the bomber used the most powerful engines, the most sophisticated radar, and the most complex fire-control system of the day. Boeing had to work out problems with the aircraft, incorporate numerous modifications, and gear up for mass production, which required the expansion of its facilities and reliance on other manufacturers. American workers and manufacturers rose to the challenge and turned this superior bomber out in amazing numbers, thirty-four hundred by mid- August 1945. In all the program cost $3.7 billion dollars, the most expensive weapons program of the war, including the atomic bomb project. Prior to the war the airmen devoted little to no attention to fire bombing and did not develop an
