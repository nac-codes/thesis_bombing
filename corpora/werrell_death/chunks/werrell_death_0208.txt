can trade embargo, they were faced with either ending the war with China without victory or seizing the resources they required. The Japanese bet on a wider war and the lack of American will for victory. Meanwhile the United States ramped up the pressure and preparations against Japan. In July 1941 the president approved a plan 133 to send American twin-engine bombers and crews to China to conduct incendiary bombing of Japan. Meanwhile the United States reversed its long-held position that the Philippine archipelago was indefensible and initiated actions to reinforce the garri- son. The change in policy may have resulted from the optimistic and persuasive requests of the top officer in the Philippine army, Douglas MacArthur, or from a mistaken view of the B-17's capabilities. Another possibility is that the decision makers were grasping at straws and believed they had to do something, anything. Guam, the Philippines, and Siberia. In fact American bombers lacked the capacity to do very much, and in any event, seventeen of the thirty-five Forts on Clark Field were destroyed on the first day of the war. No B-17s bombed Japan. The incendiary bombs require discussion before moving on. The American airmen had little incentive to develop incendiary bombs because of the emphasis on precision bombing, although incendiaries were a very effective munition. The M-47 incendiary bomb, which the United States put into service in 1940, weighed seventy-three pounds and was judged to have twelve times the effect against combustible building and one and a half times the effect against noncombustible or fire-resistant build- ings as a 500-pound high-explosive bomb. Prompted by a request from Arnold in September 1941, the Americans went on to develop an even more effective fire bomb. The AAF first tested this 6-pound device in early 1942, and in tests in mid-1943 against replica German and Japanese villages, it demonstrated not only that it was the most effective fire bomb but also the
