experienced personnel, winter weather, threats of a strike, and friction with the civil- ian workers. Moving into Battle The AAF planned to begin operations with the XXth Bomber Command, consisting of two bomb wings that would oper- ate out of China. Although the first B-29 bomb wing, the 58th, had as its nucleus twenty-five highly experienced pilots and twenty-five highly experienced navigators and drew many high-time instructor pilots, only 10 percent of the unit's officers had previous overseas experience. Training was a major problem, hampered by a dearth of B-29s due to the aircraft's developmental difficulties, the B-29's low in-commission rate, a shortage of mechanics, poor weather, and especially the slow flow of engines. Little wonder that training fell behind The AAF moved the support person- nel and materiel by sea and the B-29s by an 11,500-statute-miles air route to India. The first B-29 touched down near Calcutta on April 2, and by the end of the month 130 had arrived. The bases they found left much to be desired. One crewmember's first impression of India was that "there  CHAPTER 6 RAZING JAPAN were no barracks, no paved streets, nothing but insects, heat and dirt."9 Food was poor, recreational facilities almost nonexistent, sanitation minimal, and disease prevalent. The bases lacked concrete taxiways, tools, and engine stands. Supply of parts was slow. But if things were bad in India, they were even more primitive in China. There bases were built by half a million Chinese break- ing up rock by hand and pulling huge rollers (requiring five hundred to six hundred Chi- nese workers) to tamp down the one-and-a- half-mile long, six-foot-thick runways. The construction took three months, the first B-29 landing on April 24. Supply of the advanced bases in China was extremely difficult. In the twelve hun- dred miles between the Indian and Chinese bases stood the Himalayan mountains and some of the most difficult terrain on the planet. This, combined with a
