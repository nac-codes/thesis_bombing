the European experience. The aircraft industry was selected as the "overriding intermedi- ate objective," industry second, and shipping third. The planners recommended that the six largest cities not be hit extensively until an adequate force was available to destroy them in a month and that the B-29s engage in the mining campaign. Intelligence in the Pacific bombing campaign proved to be even more of a problem than the one in European due to the secretiveness of the Japanese and because, unlike the situa- tion in Europe, the Americans lacked the useful, if not essential, aid from the British and underground. On November 1, 1944, a B-29 photo plane, aptly named the Tokyo Rose, found clear weather over the Japanese capital, a rare occurrence, and orbited for one hour at thirty-two thousand feet taking pictures. This was the first American aircraft to fly over Tokyo since Doolittle's April Operations from the Marianas The path of the second B-29 unit to war was somewhat easier than its predecessor. The 73rd Bomb Wing sequenced through the same bases and encountered some of the same problems as did the 58th. However, it received more and better training, averag- ing more than three times the flying time in Superforts as did the first unit. The first B-29, Joltin' Josie-The Pacific Pioneer, landed on Saipan on October 12, piloted by the commander of XXIst Bomber Command, Gen. Haywood Hansell. Hansell had a rich background in bombers, having taught at the Air Corps Tactical School, where he played a part in the development of the American strategic bombing theory. He had both planning and command experience, having been a key participant in writing both AWPD/1  CHAPTER 6 RAZING JAPAN 1942 raid, and it demonstrated beginner's luck, for thirty of forty-nine reconnaissance missions during the rest of the year encoun- tered weather problems. The bombing of Japan differed con- siderably from the bombing of Germany. Distances were much greater, about two and half times that o
