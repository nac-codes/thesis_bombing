the runway. The bad news was the problems with winds and clouds, poor bombing results, and fuel problems; the good news was the weak Japanese defenses, which were to characterize the high-level daylight bombing of Japan. Hansell continued to attack Japanese tar- gets using high-altitude, precision, daylight tactics. During his tenure the XXIst flew ten such missions against Japan as well as two experimental incendiary raids. The most successful of the precision attacks was on January 19, 1945, against Japan's third largest aircraft manufacturer. The 73rd launched eighty bombers, sixty-two of which bombed the primary target from a lower than normal altitude (twenty-seven thou- sand feet) through unusually clear weather, permitting better than average accuracy: 21 percent of the bombs impacted within one thousand feet of the aiming point. The bombing knocked the engine factory out of production for six months and the airframe plant out for four. Hansell had additional problems besides the weather and distance. Serviceability was poor, and airborne aborts were frequent. Engines were the major difficulty, although it appeared that about every other system added to the maintenance woes. Operations at high altitude caused engine strain, greater consumption of fuel, and freezing of equip- ment. Inexperienced ground crews had to 141 contend with all kinds of shortages along with coral dust. was not pleased with the XXIst, writing after a few weeks that the staff he found was a worthless lot of misfits. He thought little better of the rest of the outfit, an initial opinion he also had of the XXth Bomber Command. The XXIst's commander took a number of measures to deal with these problems. He pushed for additional training of aircrews and the formation of lead crews. In early December Hansell began to send three sorties a day on "weather strike missions" to harass the Japanese, gather weather informa- tion, and conduct photo and radar recon- naissance.
