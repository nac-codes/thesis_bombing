average of three tons in November and December. The first of 325 bombers took off in the late afternoon of March 9, 1945, for Tokyo. The weather was clear as the bombs began to fall early the next morning, with a record 86 percent of those launched dropping seventeen hundred tons of bombs on the city. The Twentieth Air Force lost fourteen bombers, but the Japanese lost far more. Huge fires swept Tokyo, burning out sixteen square miles, destroying a quarter of city's buildings, including twenty-two AAF targets, and rendering one million homeless. Estimates of the number of dead vary, with the most credible range between eighty thousand and one hundred thousand. The exact number will never be known, but this attack was certainly one of the deadliest air attacks of all time. The XXIst stood down for six days and then flew three precision raids: two low-level night attacks on engine plants that were unsuccessful and a day medium assault that achieved excellent results with 22 percent of the bombs hitting within one thousand feet of the aiming point. Then the B-29s switched to other targets the airmen considered diversions. The first was to sup- port the invasion of Okinawa with a series of attacks of airfields in southern Japan that comprised three-quarters of the unit's efforts  CHAPTER 6 RAZING JAPAN between April 17 and May 11 and cost twenty-two bombers. The other change was to engage in mining operations. Little known to most, it proved to be very effective, quite cheap, and one of the B-29's most significant contributions to victory. American sub- marines had savaged the limited Japanese merchant fleet on which the Japanese depended for imports of raw materials and food. Mines were another major weapon in this campaign. The Allies had planted more than twelve thousand mines in areas distant from Japan, mostly using aircraft. The XXth Bomber Command had a minor role in these operations, dispatching 176 bomb- ers that seeded almost one thousand mines on their prima
