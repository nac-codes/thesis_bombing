July, and 0.3 in August. The overall B-29 loss rate for the war was 1 percent of aircraft airborne. The unit went into action on June 26, 1945. In all the 315th flew fifteen night attacks against oil targets, picked not for their importance but because they had not been attacked and thus would allow the effectiveness of the B-29B to be better assessed and because they were sited on the coastline where the land-water contrast made them an outstanding radar target. The unit achieved excellent results with accuracy at least as good as that of daylight, visual bombing and on a number of occa- sions exceeding it. (In contrast the radar tail gun turned out to be a failure in combat, searching without locking on, locking on but not searching, and, most of all, failing to distinguish between hostile fighters and friendly bombers.) The effective destruction of Japanese oil refineries was a wonderful test of the system but did not help win the war as Japanese oil production already was in decline due to strangulation of imports. 16 The Twentieth Air Force introduced a new technique when the fifth and last B-29 Bomb Wing (315th) went into action on June 26. It flew the B-29B, a Superfort that differed from her siblings in two ways. It was fitted with a different radar designed for precision radar bombing. The Eagle radar employed a fixed antenna, which gave it better resolution than the standard rotating antenna, mounted under the belly parallel to the wing and appearing as short second wing. The device had two drawbacks, how- ever. First, it only scanned an area 60 degrees to the front, limiting its navigational use, and second, the antenna added drag, reducing speed by five miles per hour and range by one hundred miles. As the bomber would be used in night bombing the AAF removed the turrets, blisters, guns, and ammunition which reduced weight almost four tons that offset the additional drag of the antenna. Boeing added a tail turret with three radar- Another new tactic the
