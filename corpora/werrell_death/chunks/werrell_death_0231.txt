ed the turrets, blisters, guns, and ammunition which reduced weight almost four tons that offset the additional drag of the antenna. Boeing added a tail turret with three radar- Another new tactic the XXIst employed beginning in late July was to issue warnings to Japanese civilians before the B-29 attacks.

The problem was not to defeat the Japanese-they were clearly beaten-the problem was to get the Japanese to surrender. The United States conducted a crash program to develop nuclear weapons, fear- ing that the Germans
