engines as the B-29, first flew in September 1942 (two weeks before the B-29), and exhibited a number of problems. Delays were chronic and not helped by the crash of one of the two experimental aircraft in May 1943. The Consolidated B-32 was an improved B-24 built as a backup to the B-29. The deletion of its remote-controlled retractable turrets and pressurized cabin rendered it inferior to the B-29. Various problems derailed ambitious AAF plans for the bomber and only fifteen saw combat in the closing weeks of the war. (National Museum of the USAF) In addition, directional instability pushed Convair made a number of changes so that the production model was somewhat different from the prototype. Problems with both pressurization and the fire-control sys- tem led to their deletion, which cancelled two of the B-32's major advantages over the Liberator and meant that the B-32 was less advanced than the B-29. The revised aircraft armament consisted of five manually operated power turrets (nose, two upper, belly, and tail) each mounting twin .50s. 149 the designers to a single tail empennage, requiring a major redesign. One significant innovation was to fit reversible propellers on the inboard engines, which reduced landing roll, a first and its one technical advantage over the B-29. Even the bomber's name caused problems. Originally named "Terminator" by the company in January 1944, the AAF changed it to "Dominator" that August. But the latter name riled the State Department, so it was changed back to the original in 1945.  CHAPTER 6 0 RAZING JAPAN The AAF planned to deploy the bomber to the Mediterranean theater and, after ser- vice tests were completed, transition units in both the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces into the new bomber. But delays dogged the aircraft so that by the end of 1944 the AAF had accepted only thirteen B-32s. Mechanical problems, delays, and com- plaints of faulty workmanship almost led to its cancellation in late 1944. In 1942 the National Adv
