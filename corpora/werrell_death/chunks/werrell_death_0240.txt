weighing just under nine thousand tons. Fifteen bombers went down in this effort. The aerial mining accounted for 63 percent of the Japanese merchant ships destroyed during its dura- tion from March to the end of the war. About half the mines were seeded in the Shimonoseki Straits, reducing its traffic by June to 10 percent of the premining total and to less than 2 percent by August. In combination with the submarines, which sank 60 percent of Japanese shipping, the mining effectively isolated the Japanese from imports of food and raw materials. The American effort effectively strangled Japan's industry and people. Japan's food supply shrank because of the reduction of domestic food production (in 1944 it was one-quarter below prewar levels), the destruction of one-quarter of Japan's emer- gency rice supplies by the fire raids, and the 153 drop in fish catches by more than half. The result was that the average daily per capita caloric consumption dropped from two thousand in 1941 to seventeen hundred in 1945. Had the war continued, the Japanese would have faced famine. The Pacific war cost the Twentieth Air Force 414 B-29s, 148 attributed to enemy causes, 151 to operational causes, and 115 to unknown causes.23 The unit listed 1,090 men as dead, 1,732 as missing in action, and 362 as surviving enemy captivity, inter- ment, or missing status. Compared with the bombing of Germany, the bombing of Japan was much more efficient in terms of dura- tion, destruction, tons dropped, sorties flown, and bombers lost. The B-29s were also a major factor in undermining Japanese morale as the Japa- nese government could not conceal their helplessness against the bombing attacks and the great damage inflicted on the country. While low morale could not overthrow an authoritarian government, it did lead to high absenteeism at the factories, rising to 12 percent in the undamaged aircraft plants and 40 percent in those damaged. And the bombing did have an impact on the think- ing of the
