immediate postwar period. One of the most significant, largely unappreciated by laymen, was aerial refueling, which emerged into operational use in the late 1940s and early in the 1950s and gave essentially unlimited range to the bombers. Another development was the miniaturization of nuclear warheads, allowing the use of smaller aircraft than had previously been the norm, thus blurring the lines between "strategic" and "tactical" aircraft. The period from 1945 to 1965 saw rapid change and was a most eventful period for our story. 155  shi s lock 156 CHAPTER 7 THE POSTWAR ERA Context of the Times Between World War II and the Korean War the U.S. military was shaped by three major factors: a military policy of economy, the independence of the air arm, and the Cold War. After the long years of economic depression and war, Americans wanted to enjoy peace and prosperity. Therefore, despite disturbing events overseas, until 1950 the United States maintained a policy of economy and greatly reduced its military. The impact on the air arm was dramatic. The AAF had grown to 243 groups in 1944, and while wartime planning contemplated a peacetime strength of 105 groups, by August 1945 the planners were forced to downscale their plans to 70 groups, 25 to 26 of which would fly very heavy bombers. Lack of funding made it impossible to field this number until the Korean War changed everything, so that by 1952 the Air Force reached 70 groups. the struggle for supremacy between two powers with contrasting ideologies, systems, and aims. (This is not to imply that there was equal responsibility for the dangerous international situation, far from it.) The American Air Force, 1945-1950 The second major event was the cre- ation of a Department of Defense and the establishment of an independent U.S. Air Force. The Army mainly supported this development, but the Navy did not. And now there was a three-way fight over bud- gets, intensified by the government's policy of economy, that would f
