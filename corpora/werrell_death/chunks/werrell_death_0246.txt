and by 1951 to 364 aircraft. The air arm also lacked atomic bombs. The United States had 9 bombs in 1946, 50 by 1948, and 450 by 1950. The bombs, 157 rather their components, were under the control of a civilian agency (Atomic Energy Commission) stored apart from the bomb- ers, and required time-consuming assembly. By mid-1948 two could be assembled in a day. These bombs weighed about five tons each and were difficult to load into a B-29. Consequently it would take five to six days for the AAF to launch nuclear strikes. air forces of World War II and specifically recommended changing SAC's training pro- gram, advocating more realistic training mis- sions. Lindbergh did not spare either Kenney or McMullen. The situation demanded change, and it came in short order. In October Kenney was posted to head Air University. Clearly this transfer from the nation's primary military unit, certainly the USAF's, to an educational assignment was neither a promotion nor a lateral move. Curtis LeMay became SAC's new com- mander, and has come to symbolize many things, and is probably the personification of strategic bombing.3 LeMay was a pilot and crack navigator before the war, com- manded a bomb group that pioneered new formations and bombing techniques over Germany, was promoted to head a bomb wing he led on the Regensburg portion of the famous August 1943 Schweinfurt- Regensburg mission, and went on to com- mand B-29s, first operating out of India and China and then the Marianas, where he innovated the very destructive and effective fire raids on Japan. No AAF officer had more experience or success in strategic bombing than LeMay. His task with SAC was as difficult as it was important. LeMay emphasized training, standardization, flying safety, and his personnel, making the unit an elite force.4 He commanded the unit for an unprecedented eight and half years and is correctly credited with making it a formidable fighting machine and dominate force in the USAF, U.S. military, and w
