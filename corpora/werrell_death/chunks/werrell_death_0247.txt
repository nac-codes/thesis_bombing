lite force.4 He commanded the unit for an unprecedented eight and half years and is correctly credited with making it a formidable fighting machine and dominate force in the USAF, U.S. military, and world military. SAC was the core of American deterrence for decades, operating as close to a wartime basis as possible. SAC was in poor shape not only because of restricted finances but also due to poor leadership. Its initial commander, George Kenney, had little strategic bombing experi- ence, was engaged in the proposed UN air force, and spent considerable time in speaking engagements. He left his deputy, Clements McMullen, who also lacked strategic bombing experience, in charge. McMullen instituted a disastrous personnel policy that undercut morale and efficiency and neglected realistic combat training. In a May 1947 practice mission against New York City the airmen planned to launch essentially all its available bombers, and got one hundred to the target, with another thirty unable to get off the ground, a clear reflection of the unit's capabilities. As later events demonstrated, this exercise overesti- mated the command's readiness. In early 1948 the Air Force asked Charles Lindbergh to survey SAC's combat capability. The famed aviator discussed his findings with Chief of Staff Hoyt Vanden- burg and filed his report in September. It was damning. Lindbergh criticized pilot proficiency, crew teamwork, high accident rates, inexperienced personnel, the overwork, and maintenance. He noted the need for higher standards in the atomic age than those that had proven satisfactory with the mass  shi s lock CHAPTER 7 158 THE POSTWAR ERA LeMay pushed realistic exercises to gain a clear view of SAC's true capabilities and to impress upon the crews the need for improvement and hard work. In January 1949 SAC ran a practice mission against Dayton, Ohio, using pictures from 1938 (about the currency of most information the USAF had on Soviet targets), "bomb- ing" from thirty thousand
