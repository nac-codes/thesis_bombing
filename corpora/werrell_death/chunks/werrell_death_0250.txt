nuclear bom- bardment campaign as the atomic bombs became available, along with a much larger conventional one. The airmen intended to hit Soviet oil installations with night, radar- guided, solo bombing. The AAF's early plan envisaged a campaign that would last nine months and destroy three-quarters of the Soviet oil. An air plan in the summer of 1947 targeted forty-nine Soviet cities for destruction with one hundred bombs, an attack calculated to take out half of the country's industry. (The reader will recall that this exceeded the number of nuclear weapons then available.) The JCS agreed to a May 1948 plan that called for operations from Britain, Egypt, Okinawa, and possibly Iceland that focused on bombing twenty cities as well as oil and mining shipping lanes. LeMay quickly changed the SAC plan from a gradual delivery of nuclear weapons to one massive strike against the Soviets. In December 1949 the JCS approved a plan involving 292 nuclear weapons aimed at industrial, electric power, transportation, armament, and oil targets. SAC added more targets as more weapons and aircraft became available. Until the 1960s the United States planned to employ massive nuclear strikes. The manned overflights produced valu- able intelligence for the airmen. Not only did they obtain accurate photographs for future bombing operations, they energized Soviet defenses, giving the Americans a wealth of data on these systems and their operation. These flights in the 1950s high- lighted the weaknesses of Russian defenses, while the U-2 shootdown showed the capa- bility of surface-to-air missiles against very high flying, slow, nonmaneuvering aircraft in 1960. New technology aided the Americans. Within months of the U-2 incident and after a dozen failures, the United States recovered the first data from a Corona reconnaissance satellite, a system authorized in 1956. Satellites were not only invulner- able to Communist defenses but also did not risk pilots or international incidents, a
