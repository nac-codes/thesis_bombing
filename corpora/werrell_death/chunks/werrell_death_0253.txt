an fashion, the air- men developed a technical solution to the problem: air-to-air refueling. Americans had made some record-breaking endurance flights in the 1920s using this technique, the most famous of which was the January 1929 Question Mark flight, which stayed aloft for nearly 151 hours. But these were dramatic stunts. It was the British who pioneered a practical solution, which they demon- strated on sixteen transatlantic crossings in 1938. The AAF tested the British system in 1943 with B-24s refueling B-17s but went no further. While there was little need for bomber range extension in the European air war, certainly there was for bombers in the Pacific, although refueling hundreds of fighters and bombers was impractical at the 161 time. Nevertheless, the British and Ameri- cans must be criticized for not developing this proven method to extend the range of their reconnaissance and antisubmarine patrol aircraft. After the war the British resumed the transatlantic refueled flights. Amazingly, despite the British flights and the clear need for range extension, it was not until October 1947 that SAC initiated a request for aerial refueling, which the USAF gave the highest priority the next January. The quickest way to satisfy the tardy requirement was to adopt the British system. Matters now moved rapidly as the USAF bought equipment sets (and rights) from the British and received its first converted B-29s from Boeing in May 1948. Flight tests began that month, with the 509th Bomb Group accomplishing a dozen hookups by the end of the year. thousand feet. The Americans simplified the system and changed to a larger hose and pressurized system that tripled the pumping rate and allowed refueling at higher altitudes. Aerial refueling evolved further. Boeing developed a flying boom on the tanker that telescoped from twenty-seven to forty-five feet and was inserted into a receptacle on a bomber flying closely below and behind the tanker. This system could pump faster
