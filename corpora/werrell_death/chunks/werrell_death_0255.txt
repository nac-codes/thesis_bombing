e B-50s to be launched in sequence until one completed the circuit. The first that took off, in February 1949, was forced by engine problems to land in the Azores. The second, Lucky Lady II, completed the 23,500-mile flight in ninety-four hours with four in-air refuelings. U.S. bombers now could reach any point on the globe. The USAF wanted a better system because the British cross-over method was complicated, limited to a maximum speed of 190 mph and maximum altitude of ten  us s lock CHAPTER 7 162 the probe and drogue system, as did the Navy and the North Atlantic Treaty Orga- nization (NATO). In 1959 the USAF fitted booms with an adapter to allow the refuel- ing of probe-equipped aircraft (however, this can only be changed on the ground). The USAF converted 92 B-29s into crossover tankers (KB-29M) and another 74 B-29s into receivers (B-29MR) for that system. SAC retired the tankers in 1954. The USAF also converted 116 B-29s into boom tankers (KB-29P), the first delivered to SAC in September 1950, which served with that command until 1957. Another Boeing air- craft became SAC's standard prop tanker, the KC-97, itself a development of the B-50. SAC got its first Stratotanker in July 1951, eventually receiving over eight hundred, which served in the regular Air Force until December 1965. four RF-80s for reconnaissance missions over North Korea. This was followed a week later when an RB-45C was refueled on a similar operation, and in October tankers refueled F-84s on a combat mission. Flying Wing and Mixmaster The airmen also developed longer range aircraft. One of the best known, well beyond its importance, is the Northrop Flying Wing. Jack Northrop was fascinated, if not obsessed, by the possibilities of an aircraft without the drag and weight of fuselage and tail. He built and flew a number of such designs, and in 1941 won a contract to build a bomber version. The XB-35 was designed to achieve a top speed of 380 mph, mount twenty .50-caliber guns, and reach a rang
