The first combat aerial refueling was in July 1951, when a tanker refueled (Right) Although Northrop won a contract to build the B-35 in 1941, the Flying Wing did not get airborne until June 1946. It had a strikingly different configuration than other aircraft, and although very large, it lacked space in its bomb bay to fit an atomic bomb. These constraints, along with propeller and stability problems, led to its demise.

The Flying Wing would be revived within a few years powered by jets, as was the case with the Douglas XB-42. 165 The Douglas B-42 was another unusual design that sharply contrasted with the Northrop bomber. It was a small aircraft that was quickly designed, built, and flown; possessed unusual performance; and was conceived as a cheap substitute for the B-29. It had a wing span of seventy-one feet and weighed a mere twenty-one thousand pounds empty and had a takeoff gross weight of thirty-six thousand pounds. (The B-29's span was twice this, its empty weight over three times, and its maximum weight four times that of the Douglas bomber.) The Mixmaster was manned by a crew of three, the pilots seated side by side with "bug eye" canopies and powered by twin liquid-cooled engines in the fuselage that turned counter- rotating props mounted on the tail cone. (The bomber was defended by two rear facing, underwing turrets, each with twin guns, controlled by the copilot reversing his seat, and two fixed forward firing machine guns.) It first flew in May 1944 and was expected to exceed 450 mph and fly five thousand miles with a one-ton bomb load (1,800 miles with four tons). Flight tests disappointed the AAF as controls proved inadequate; speed, altitude, and range were less than desired; and there were vibration Another unique design was the Douglas XB-42, a small, quickly
