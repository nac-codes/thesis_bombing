ght tests disappointed the AAF as controls proved inadequate; speed, altitude, and range were less than desired; and there were vibration Another unique design was the Douglas XB-42, a small, quickly developed bomber. The Mixmaster was manned by a three- man crew and powered by twin engines that turned counterrotating propellers mounted on the tail. It did not meet performance expectations. (National Museum of the USAF) problems. The company built two, one of which crashed due to pilot error. The other was reincarnated as a jet. The B-29 (and B-50) Superfortress Now to move from the fascinating to the important aircraft. For years after the war the Boeing B-29 was the backbone of the United States' strategic bombing. The airmen took Superforts out of storage and with little or no modification put them into service. Their numbers rose from 148 in SAC in December 1946, to a peak of 516 in December 1948, and numbered 435 in December 1952 (comprising 44 percent of the bombers and reconnaissance bombers in the USAF inventory), with the last bomber retired in November 1954. Two prop bomb- ers supplanted the B-29. The Boeing B-50 looked like, performed only somewhat better than, and was directly related to the B-29. It began life in 1944, when Boeing upgraded the B-29's engines with the more powerful R 4360 and redes- ignated the bomber XB-44, then B-29D, and finally in December 1945, B-50.The company claimed it was 75 percent different than the B-29, despite its looks. The main improvement was 60 percent greater power, an advantage somewhat mitigated by five tons of additional weight (a considerable amount due to the engine change) produc- ing a small performance edge.9 problems during its service, more than might be expected from a derivative design. The B-50 had difficulty carrying the new atomic bombs because the bomb developer, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), and the USAF were not in close coordina- tion, the very tight secrecy surrounding the bomb, and because th
