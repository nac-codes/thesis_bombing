carrying the new atomic bombs because the bomb developer, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), and the USAF were not in close coordina- tion, the very tight secrecy surrounding the bomb, and because the bomb bay had been designed before the atomic bomb and proved too small for the later versions. Ini- tially metal skin cracking required extensive modification, and throughout its service engine problems were chronic, turbosuper- chargers failed, and valves and tanks leaked. It first flew in June 1947 and entered SAC service in February 1948; SAC had more than 200 on its books in December 1951, with the last leaving in October 1955. Boe- ing built 371 B-50s. The Last USAF Prop Bomber More impressive was the massive B-36, which was the culmination of the effort to gain range by building larger and larger aircraft. The German conquest of Western Europe and the precarious position of Brit- ain pushed the American airmen toward a transcontinental bomber. The Air Corps sent out invitations for design studies in April 1941 with requirements cut back in August to a ten-thousand-mile range with a five- ton bomb load. That November the airmen picked Consolidated to build the bomber.10 The B-50 was a stop gap bomber, slightly superior to the workhorse B-29, a backup for the troubled B-36, and waiting to be replaced by the jet bombers then in the design and test stages. It was neither a new nor trailblazing aircraft, and had constant The aircraft's development experienced numerous delays during the war as the aircraft encountered problems with weight, the power plant, and faulty workmanship. Thus the XB-36 did not make its first flight until August 1946. The B-36 was a giant  shift os lock . 166 CHAPTER 7 THE POSTWAR ERA that indicated how far aviation had come in just one decade. The B-17 that first flew in October 1935 weighed 24,500 pounds empty, the B-29 that made its maiden flight in September 1942 weighed 70,000 pounds empty, and the empty B-36 weighed twice that.
