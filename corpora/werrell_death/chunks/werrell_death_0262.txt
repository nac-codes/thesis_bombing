e mated to the B-36. A second system attached fighters to bomber wing tips. After several successful link ups, the Air Force cancelled Project Tip Tow after an April 1953 accident that destroyed the B-29 and one F-84 and killed all the aircrew. The B-36 Tom Tom project consisted of a claw- like clamp fitted on the fighter's wing tip that could be mated to a receptacle on the bomber's wing tip that allowed the fighter to hook up to the bomber and receive a tow along with fuel, pressurization, and heat. The USAF tested airborne linkups with an empty weight twice that of a B-29. The Peacemaker first flew in August 1946 as seen here. (Note the single wheel main landing gear.) Although the B-36 was very controversial, it provided SAC with a long-range bomber until superseded by the B-52.

These systems were ingenious, difficult and dangerous, and proved to be impractical. Aside from that the idea that a stubby parasite fighter could over- come defending fighters and then recover aboard a battling bomber defies common sense. And the concept that fighter pilots attached to wing tips could successfully battle after long hours in their cockpit and recover aboard their carriers was just as farfetched. A third parasite effort was more suc- cessful and went into service. Project Ficon (Fighter Conveyor) began in 1950 and involved an F-84 semienclosed in three of the B-36's four bomb bays. The bomber could launch and retrieve the fighter as well as takeoff mated. Ficon evolved from bombers carrying fighter escort, into a method to extend the range of high-speed  shi s lock 168 CHAPTER 7 THE POSTWAR ERA 169 reconnaissance aircraft.
