The Air Force suc- cessfully tested the scheme in April 1952 with a straight-wing F-84E and went on to convert ten bombers and twenty-five swept-wing RF-84Ks and put the combi- nation into operation for one year during 1955. The combat radius of the two aircraft was thirty-five hundred nautical miles. the nature of a future war. Many AAF and USAF airmen believed that strategic bomb- ing could win future wars and that atomic bombers were adequate for defense. The Navy strongly disagreed, as summed up by Rear Adm. Ralph Ostie, who asserted, "We consider that strategic air warfare, as practiced in the past and as proposed for the future, is militarily unsound and of limited effect, is morally wrong, and is decidedly harmful to the stability of a postwar world."14 RESCUE the TURTLE PACIFIC AUSTRALAN CANADA UNITED STATES MILS. SC Meanwhile the bomber demonstrated performance and encountered critics. In December 1948 a B-36 took off from its Texas base (Fort Worth), dropped a five-ton bomb load near Hawaii, and returned home, covering the eight thousand miles in 35.5 hours. In March 1949 a B-36B carried five tons of bombs half way on a ninety- six-hundred-mile mission. The USAF conducted these flights to show off the giant bomber and still its many critics for as late as 1948 the USAF considered canceling the bomber because of tight budgets. However, the heating up of the Cold War, especially the Berlin Blockade, which began in June 1948, changed many minds. Concurrently the B-36 only slowly overcame its problems, underwent considerable modification, and achieved true operational status in 1952. The bomber faced its most serious challenge during the infamous "Revolt of the Admirals" incident, the most egregious example of interservice rivalry in U.S. history. The primary issue was funding, although the overall
