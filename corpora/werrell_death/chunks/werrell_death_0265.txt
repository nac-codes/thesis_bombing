Thomas Davies (seen here as RADM) commanded the Lockheed P2V Truculent Turtle, which flew nonstop and unrefueled over 11,200 miles from Australia to Ohio. Later, P2Vs were launched off of aircraft carriers.

Later models ("F,""H," and "J") featured slightly more powerful engines and thus slightly higher speeds. SAC fielded a peak of 317 B-36s in December 1955, began junking the bomber in February 1956, and retired the last one in February 1959. Convair built 385 B-36s. (Right) The United States sought a long-range, great endurance aircraft and considered using nuclear propulsion. A nuclear reactor was fitted aboard a The supercarrier and B-36 became surrogates as the two services battled over money and missions, a dispute that spilled over into an unseemly, public interservice brawl. The Air Force took shots at the Navy's carriers, and the Navy reciprocated with assaults on the USAF's bomber. There were questions concerning the B-36's performance and the carrier's cost, vulner- ability, and utility in a strategic war. One future chief of naval operations (1955-61), Arleigh Burke, called the B-36 a "billion dollar blunder."16 In May 1949, shortly after the supercarrier cancellation, an anomymous document, later connected with a Navy official, was leaked to Congress claiming corruption in the procurement of the B-36, overstatement of the bomber's performance, and exaggeration of the importance of strategic bombardment. These allegations dragged the secretary of defense, secretary of the Air Force, the B-36, and the USAF into the critical eye of the press, public, and Con- gress. Charges flew, Congress investigated, and the document's author recanted. The hearings cleared the individuals and the Air Force, the chief of naval operations was fire
