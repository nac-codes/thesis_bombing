e press, public, and Con- gress. Charges flew, Congress investigated, and the document's author recanted. The hearings cleared the individuals and the Air Force, the chief of naval operations was fired, and the B-36 survived. Another effort to extend range involved nuclear power. The idea first surfaced in 1944 and really started in 1946; however, it received only limited support. In 1953 the USAF cancelled a B-36 slated to test a propulsion system18 but proceeded to test the effects of radiation on crew and airframe. A B-36 conversion, the NB-36H, was pow- ered by its conventional engines and carried a nuclear power plant that was running on twenty-one of its forty-seven sorties, although it was neither intended nor used to power the aircraft. The aircraft had a new nose structure and carried a reactor weigh- ing 17.5 tons and crew shielding weighing another 12 tons. First flying in September 1955, the NB-36H conducted successful tests until March 1957. In March 1961 the John F. Kennedy administration ended the project after an expenditure of over one bil- lion dollars. reconfigured B-36 to study the problem of protecting the crew from radiation. The NB- 36 flew numerous flights but never was powered by the reactor. (National Museum of the USAF) 15 712 The giant bomber evolved into a more potent weapon as its various problems were solved. However, its chief deficiency of low speed remained. In 1948 the manu- facturer proposed adding four jet engines mounted in two pods (essentially those from the B-47) outboard of the prop engines. These first appeared on the B-36D, and they increased takeoff and landing weights along with speed and ceiling.17 The airmen converted most of the earlier B-36Bs to the "D" configuration. One last point regarding the B-36: It was the only U.S. prop bomber capable of carrying a hydrogen bomb. The Harry Truman administration authorized develop- ment of the super bomb in January 1950, and the first was tested in November 1952. It had a yiel
