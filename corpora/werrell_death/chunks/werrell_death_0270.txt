The bombers claimed seven MiGs destroyed and escorting F-86s another four, while the Communists insist they downed ten B-29s without a loss. The Superfort's defensive armament, not tested by the Japanese as the Germans had tested the B-17 and B-24, was clearly inadequate against the MiGs. number of USAF casualties: seventy-two bombers lost, fifty seven on operations (of which twenty-four were attributed to enemy action).26 In brief, this was about the same tonnage dropped by B-29s on Japan, the same number of sorties, with about one- sixth the losses.

The airmen feared the reaction of hundreds of MiGs based only a short dis- tance from the target complex, but instead of engaging the Americans, the Communist fighters flew inland, apparently fearing an attack on their Chinese airfields. During the four-day campaign the three services flew almost eighteen hundred fighter-bomber and counter-air sorties and lost two Navy aircraft whose pilots were rescued. The attacks took out over 90 percent of North Korea's electricity potential, subjecting that nation to a blackout for two weeks and cutting Chinese industrial production. Far from the scene the bombing stirred reaction, as some members of the British Parliament cried provocation while some U.S. congress- men asked why these targets had not been hit earlier. The operation was remarkable for the successful bombing and low losses as well as its rare joint air effort. As a result of high losses the USAF stopped the deep, daylight bomber
