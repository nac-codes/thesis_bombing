planning an attack on twenty dams in February 1953, but when Gen. Otto Weyland, commander of Far East Air Forces, was briefed, he reportedly was "skeptical of the feasibility On May 13 fifty-nine F-84s attacked a stone and earthen dam twenty miles north of Pyongyang; it broke that night. The flooding took out five bridges, six miles of one of two north-south rail lines serving the North Korean capital, two miles of highway, covered one airfield, and destroyed five square miles of rice. F-84 bombing on May 15 and 16 destroyed a second dam, the flooding from which cut the other north-south rail line. Although B-29 attacks scored hits on a third dam on May 21-22 and 29, the dam held as the Communists had quickly responded to the U.S. strikes by lowering the reservoir's water level. Similar action enabled other dams to withstand attacks by American aircraft in June. Nev- ertheless, the destruction was extensive (the rail lines did not reopen for two weeks) and the lack of water impacted negatively on the rice harvest. American timing deserves criti- cism, for had the attacks been compressed as originally planned, the result would have been far more effective. The two operations foreshadowed the future: the use of fighter- bombers and attack aircraft against strategic targets and the sensitivity of attacking dams and an enemy's food supply.25 During the war, B-29s flew almost twenty thousand effective sorties and dropped 168,000 tons of bombs, just over half at night. Only about 7 percent of this effort was directed at industrial targets. The crews of the B-29s suffered the greatest The Korean War indicated that even escorted formations of B-29s could not survive against modern jet fighters, which the Soviets had in abundance. The change brought by jets was rapid for only five years after World War II, where the B-29 was clearly the outstanding bomber; jet fight- ers rendered it obsolete. The capabilities of the MiG-15 and the difficulties of the B-29s demonstrated the
