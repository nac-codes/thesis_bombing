, each of which turned two giant, eighteen-foot- diameter counterrotating props and was defended by three turrets, each mounting twin 23-mm cannons. The Tu-95 first flew in November 1952 and encountered diffi- culties with both engines and propellers that were worked out. It could carry the largest Soviet bombs, and one dropped a 20-ton,  BIUS s lock 178 CHAPTER 7 THE POSTWAR ERA 50-megaton hydrogen bomb in October 1961. The Russians introduced probe and drogue aerial refueling with the Tu-95 in 1964. The Bear entered operational service in April 1956, remains in the Russian long-range bomber force today, and has per- formed in a number of other roles during its long service. The Soviets also used one aircraft in nuclear aircraft tests (similar to the NB-36) beginning in the mid-1950s and extend- ing into the early 1960s. It flew thirty-four sorties before being terminated because of cost, weight, and the cancellation of the U.S. program. In the late 1950s a few (fifteen or so) improved variants appeared armed with air-to-surface missiles (ASM), the Kh-20 (AS-3 Kangaroo), a large missile requiring the entire weapons bay.28 In the early 1980s the Soviets put the 6-ton Kh-22 into ser- vice. The Tu-95 could carry as many as three beneath its wings and fuselage. U.S. develop- ment of small cruise missiles triggered a Soviet response in 1977 that included not only similar missile development but also resumption of production of an updated The Tu-95 Bear first flew in November 1952 and continues to fly missions today (2009). It has proven quite versatile as it can carry heavy loads over long distances. It is slightly smaller and lighter than the B-36 but has some performance advantages, especially a much higher speed.

Initial ver- sions could carry six 1.5-ton Kh-55 missiles in a rotary launcher, later versions could carry an additional ten externally, albeit with a decrease in range and speed. The Soviet bomber o
