Initial ver- sions could carry six 1.5-ton Kh-55 missiles in a rotary launcher, later versions could carry an additional ten externally, albeit with a decrease in range and speed. The Soviet bomber outperformed the B-36, its U.S. counterpart, as might be expected because it was a decade younger. The Tupolev bomber was smaller in size and somewhat lighter than the B-36, with a comparable ceiling, slightly longer range, and much higher speed.29 In 1961 there were two hundred Bears in bombing service, its 179 peak inventory, which fell to sixty-five in 2001. The Bear is the longest serving and fastest prop-powered bomber. In contrast the United States essentially skipped turboprop power for combat air- craft. There were plans for fitting the power plant to various bombers, the Air Force's B-47 and B-52, for example. Not that this power plant was not used, for the magnifi- cent Lockheed C-130 Hercules remains in service as a transport and gunship almost half a century since its first flight. Instead the United States converted to jet power.  s lock Chapter 8 180 BETWEEN KOREA AND VIETNAM Between Korea and Vietnam THE TRANSITION TO JETS et propulsion was a significant tech- J pological change that markedly trans- formed, if not revolutionized, aviation. The Germans introduced jets in World War II, and both the United Nations and Com- munist air forces employed jet fighters in the Korean War. Transitioning bombers to jet power lagged, so that jet-powered bombers did not enter service until after jet fighters. Early American Jet Bombers The United States made a slow start with jet propulsion due to its focus on the immedi- ate demands of World War II, while the slow transition to jet bombers was due mainly to technical problems. In September 1943 the AAF initiated studies to incorporate jet engines into an experimental bomber and encouraged a number of manufacturers to submit preliminary designs. The American airmen were pushing turboprops for heavy bombers, and in April
