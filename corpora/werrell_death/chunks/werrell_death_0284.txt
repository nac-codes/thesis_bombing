than the B-36 (at least 50 mph top speed and 150 mph cruising speed), it had only about one-third the range, a restricted bomb-carrying capacity, and significant stability problems. Although these issues probably would have been solved, this would have taken both time and effort.

Many of the aircraft's problems were directly related to new technology (the engines) or funding difficulties (radar and systems), but some were the simple result of the aircraft being inadequately engineered and rushed into production."4 The Air Force had doubts about the B-45 early in its history, considering cancellation in June 1948 even before the first bomber went into service. In a fly-off competition for an USAF light bomber in February 1951, the Tornado lost out to the English Electric Canberra. The B-45 had a very high accident rate, over five times the major accident rate of the B-29, the least safe of the U.S. prop-driven strategic bombers of the era and almost ten times that of the jet-powered B-47. North American built 142 XB, RB, and B-45s. The USAF phased out the Tornado in 1959. North American modified fifty-five of the "A" models for delivery of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. This project began in December 1950 and involved extensive modifications of the bomb bay (because of the secrecy of the atomic bomb project, the original bomb bay required rework) and adding extra fuel tanks and new electronic equipment. The first modified bombers arrived in the United Kingdom in May 1952. The B-45 never dropped any bombs in combat, but the reconnaissance version served in the Korean War. In September 1950 three RB-45Cs arrived in Japan and in November went into action. One was lost in December to a MiG-15, the only B-45 combat loss. In January 1952 the unit was ordered to switch to night operations, for which it was ill suited. Throughout the rest of
