ing force of large seaplanes supported by transport seaplanes, surface ships, and submarines and defended by fighter seaplanes. Its propo- nents claimed it would be cheaper and more flexible than land-based strategic bombers, as well as cheaper and more survivable than aircraft carriers. In the mid-1950s the U.S. Navy proposed an innovative concept of a sea-based strategic strike force featuring jet-powered seaplane bombers protected by jet-powered seaplane fighters and supported by seaplanes, ships, and submarines. Martin built two experimental bombers, the P6M-1 Sea Master, shown here, and later fourteen service and test aircraft. Cost, problems, and more promising alternatives led to the project's demise. (USN via Air University Press) greater progress with carrier-based aviation and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. So while certainly innovative and initially promising, SSF could not compete with the alternatives, leading the Navy to cancel the project in August 1959 after spending more than a third of a billion dollars in this ten- year effort. The Enduring Bomber One quick diversion is in order before dis- cussing the B-52. In August 1950 Convair proposed an all-jet version of the B-36 and the following March was awarded a contract for the B-60. The metamorphous was achieved by sweeping back the wing and empennage, adding a retractable tail wheel to the tricycle arrangement, and substituting eight J 57 engines for the prop engines. The B-60's advantages included the potential to upgrade aircraft already in the inventory, interchangeable parts and manufacturing with the B-36 as the two aircraft were 72 percent common, as well as ease of main- tenance. Convair converted two bombers, the first of which made its maiden flight in April 1952, three days after the first B-52 flight. As might be expected this conversion could not match the performance of the more recently designed B-52. In addition flight tests demonstrated a number of unfa- vorable aspects such
