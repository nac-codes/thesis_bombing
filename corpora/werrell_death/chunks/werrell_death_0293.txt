but was told that the Air Force was really interested in a pure jet-pow- ered bomber and, over a weekend, submitted such a design. It was a notable achievement, but not quite as spectacular as the storytellers would have us believe. In fact the airmen considered changing to jets as early as the previous November and had asked the com- pany in May 1948 to study a jet-powered B-52. Turboprops offered greater range while jets promised higher speed. What tipped the scale to turbojets were problems with the turboprop engines and propellers and the prospects that it would take four years to overcome these, by which time a jet-pow- ered bomber would also be available. Head- quarters USAF approved the jet-powered bomber in January 1949. (Left) The Boeing B-52 could outperform the B-47, and its adaptability is indicated by its extraordinarily long service life beginning in 1955. It formed the bulk of the U.S. strategic bomber force from 1964 into the 1990s and remains in service today (2009). (National Museum of the USAF) 191 On a number of occasions the B-52 came close to cancellation. In early 1948, for example, the secretary of the Air Force stopped development of the B-52 as the Air Force looked carefully and approvingly on Northrop's jet-powered Flying Wing, and in January 1950 Headquarters USAF considered a number of alternatives to the B-52. LeMay championed the Stratofort, had a major influence on its design, first at Headquarters and later as commander of SAC, pushing its rapid development with 1954 as a target date because that was the projected "end of the useful operational life of the B-36" due to Soviet SAMs. 16 This led to production approval in January 1951. that was not solved until November 1953. Nevertheless the bomber made its first flight in April 1952. Early testing uncovered no major problems, but it found some minor ones that led to a number of changes, which is the purpose of testing. Leaking fuel tanks were a principal and persistent problem and ear
