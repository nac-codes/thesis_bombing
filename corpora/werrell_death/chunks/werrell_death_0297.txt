(ALCMs) (see chapter 10). The last in the B-52 line was the "H," which featured turbofan engines and a new defensive fire-control system. The engines increased power 30 percent yet reduced fuel consumption and increased range 10 to 15 percent, thus making the "H" the longest range B-52. In January 1962 a B-52H broke the unrefueled distance record with a 12,500-mile flight from Okinawa to Spain, breaking the 1946 record of the Navy's P2V Truculent Turtle. In March 1980 two B-52Hs completed an around-the-world flight of 19,500 miles in forty-two and a half hours, a feat duplicated by two other "H" models in August 1994 (20,000 miles in forty- seven-plus hours). Defensive firepower was bolstered by a six-barrel (Gatling) 20-mm gun in the tail. In response to the increasingly effective Soviet air defenses, the B-52 changed to low-level tactics, not without problems, however, for the B-52 gave a rough ride near the ground and encountered new hazards. In addition to ground obstacles and bird strikes, turbulence could (and did) cause catastrophic failures as well as increased wear and tear on the aircraft.22 The USAF assumed that low-level operations would increase structural deterioration by at least a factor of eight, a serious issue, for in contrast to the pervious Boeing bombers renown for their strength, the B-52 airframe was built light with a reduced permissible load limit factor to achieve higher speeds and longer ranges. The B-52's longevity exacerbated the problem. Whereas the prop-driven B-36 and B-50 had a fleet average of about twenty- five hundred flight hours before their phase out, Boeing designed the Stratofort for a five-thousand-flying-hour lifetime, a figure the B-52F fleet reached in 1967 and matched by the "G" and "H"models in 1970. Low-level flying (five hundred feet or less) led to bomber modifications, including changes to both the bombing-navigation system and the Doppler radar, strengthening the airframe, and adding terrain clearance radar and l
