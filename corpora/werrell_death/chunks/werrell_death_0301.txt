rule. Using the company's experience with the F-102, Convair pinched in the waist to give the fuselage its "wasp-waist" or "coke bottle" shape. Other elements included a 60-degree delta wing with a conical camber leading edge and four separate, underwing engine nacelles on pylons. The original ninety-foot- long pod was shortened to thirty feet and transformed from a conformal configuration to a pylon mount.24 The bomber featured a number of innovations. The aircraft's supersonic speeds required new materials to deal with the heat generated, resulting in a metal and fiberglass sandwich that made up 80 percent of the airframe and 90 percent of the wing. The high speed also demanded new egress provi- sions for the crew. The answer was not easy because of its late addition to the bomber's already tight cockpit. The cockpit would enclose the crewmember in the event of cabin depressurization or egress and detach from the airframe to permit safe ejection at supersonic speed, absorb landing shock, and provide a flotation device in the event of a water landing. In late 1962 the USAF began to retrofit the Hustler fleet with the new system. In service, 90 percent of ejections were successful. The manufacturer also fitted the Hustler with advanced avionics built around a twelve-hundred-pound analog Air Force opinion was divided on the Hustler. Although both the company and the Air Force developers were pleased with the progress of the design, the B-58 had numerous detractors and as late as the end of 1954 some of the top brass considered the design marginal. More serious, the intended user did not want the bomber. In January 1955 LeMay wrote the Air Force chief of staff, General Twining, that the B-58 lacked both the range and defensive capability required of an acceptable bomber and was  s lock 196 CHAPTER 8 BETWEEN KOREA AND VIETNAM 197 attitude from which the pilot could not see the runway when the aircraft was less than two hundred feet above it.
