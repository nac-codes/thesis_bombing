he final competition in 1957 were a speed of Mach 3 to 3.2, an altitude of seventy to seventy-five thousand feet, and If the B-58 was a troubled bomber that did not satisfy SAC, the B-70 was exactly what the command wanted. Nevertheless it also was a troubled bomber and had the bad for- tune to arrive at the wrong time. The B-70  yoof S 198 CHAPTER 8 BETWEEN KOREA AND VIETNAM New technology moved the aircraft toward its ambitious goals. More powerful engines and new materials helped, as did the discovery by the National Advisory Com- mittee for Aeronautics (NACA), in March 1956, of the principle of supersonic wedge or compression lift. (At supersonic speeds the shock waves created as much as one- third more lift.) As the B-70 gained weight, it added a number of beneficial changes, such as a movable windshield and ramp that retracted in supersonic flight to decrease drag, and extended during subsonic flight to increase visibility, variable geometry inlets, and a trim able canard. a range of 6,000 to 10,500 miles. Or simply put: faster, higher, farther. In December 1957 the Air Force announced North American as the contract winner. The North American design was to use a high-energy fuel (boron) in its afterburner to reach the required range. The fuel had two major drawbacks, extreme toxicity (ten times that of cyanide) that required special handling and storage and great expense. In August 1959 the Air Force cancelled the high-energy program. As the efficiency of the standard jet fuel (JP-4) increased this was not a fatal blow, although it did force North American to use a different ver- sion of the engine. The cancellation of the nuclear bomber (essentially by December 1957) and F-108 interceptor (September 1959), however, were much more seri- ous because the cost of common systems (bombing and navigation, air-to-surface missiles, bomber defenses, decoys, and engines) would now fall entirely on the B-70 program. The money crunch was such that Headquarters redirected
