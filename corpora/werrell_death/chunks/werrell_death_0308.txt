develop- ment was approved in January 1947 the Air Ministry issued a specification that resulted in contracts for the Avro Vulcan and Hand- ley Page Victor. Doubts about these two aircraft led to backup efforts. Because the authorities believed it would require eight years to meet these requirements and field such an aircraft, they added an insurance bomber, the Short Sperrin. The realization that the Short design would not meet speci- fications led the government to build yet a fourth bomber, the Vickers Valiant, with a performance between the insurance bomber and the two more advanced types. The Short S.A.4 Sperrin was designed in response to an October 1948 specification for a four-engine bomber that could carry a 5-ton bomb to a target fifteen hundred nautical miles distant at an altitude as high as forty-five thousand feet and a cruising speed of 435 knots. Two were built with the first flying in August 1951. It was a boxy, straight- wing, unattractive aircraft with its two long and large engine nacelles enclosing engines stacked vertically and mounted midwing. Production plans were nixed before its first flight because of the much more promising performance offered by the Vickers Valiant. RAF Jet Bombers Other air forces also transitioned from pis- ton to jet-propelled strategic bombers. The British needed a delivery system to make their deterrent creditable and to retain major power status but faced severe economic problems. Financial constraints ended the limited British ballistic missile research in  ock 200 CHAPTER 8 BETWEEN KOREA AND VIETNAM The first of Britain's trio of V-bombers was the Vickers Valiant. While it did not distinguish itself in the ill-fated Anglo- French Suez campaign of 1956, it was the RAF's first nuclear bomber. The graceful bomber entered service in February 1955 and was prematurely retired ten years later due to severe metal fatigue, the high cost of repairs, and the advent of other V-bombers.
