For that conflict the RAF modified five Vulcans with a good maintenance history and hardpoints (originally for the cancelled Skybolt missile), which allowed carriage of additional ECM and Shrike antiradiation missiles. The RAF added an inertial naviga- tion system and modified the bomb bay to handle a bomb load of twenty-one 1,000-pound bombs. Restoring the aerial refueling system proved a problem because of its long disuse and therefore required refurbishing the equipment and retraining the crews.33 The retraining also included dropping conventional bombs, something not done in years. 5-ton bomb load half of a required distance of 3,350 nm. The Avro delta-wing design was the most radical of those proposed and won the contract for two prototypes in July 1947. The bomber prototype made its initial flight in August 1952, and the first produc- tion model reached a combat unit in July 1957. The close cooperation between the two English speaking nations was made clear the next year when SAC included the RAF bomber in its war plans. In 1959 the bomber conducted successful aerial refueling experi- ments with Valiant tankers. The production bomber had a com- pound (curved) swept leading edge to cure problems of buffet near its maximum speed, which increased its redline speed from Mach .95 to Mach .98. The bomber also had a bubble canopy, mounted its four engines in the wing root, and was manned by a crew of five. The British quickly built an improved version, Mark 2, armed with a stand-off weapon, the Blue Steel supersonic air-to-ground, inertially guided missile, which became operational in February 1963 and stayed in service until the end of the decade. This bomber version also featured an enlarged and modified wing, more powerful engines, strengthened landing gear, and a tail
