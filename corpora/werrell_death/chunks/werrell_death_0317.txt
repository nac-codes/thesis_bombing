ert. The V-bomber story demonstrated the prowess of the British aviation industry, the limits of the British economy, as well as the constraints of finances and politics on aircraft development and deployment. Soviet Jet Bombers If the mainstay of the Russian long-range bomber force was the prop-powered Bear, the Tupolev Tu-16 Badger was its best known and most numerous jet bomber. This aircraft emerged a little later than the B-47 but served in a similar role. In 1948 Stalin ordered the Tupolev bureau to build a bomber with the range and bomb load of the Tu-4 powered by jet engines and there- fore capable of higher performance. The engines were the key, for the arrival of the AM-3, the world's most powerful jet engine in 1951, allowed the designers to substi- tute two engines for four pylon-mounted engines. What became known as the Tu-16 (NATO code named Badger) first flew in April 1952, clocked 550 knots, but fell short of the range requirement. It competed with the Ilyushin Il-46, which had approximately the same performance, but as the Tupolev had greater range it was ordered into pro- duction in December. Tupolev's production aircraft was four tons lighter than the prototype and thus had better performance and exceeded the range specification. It had a long fuselage and The Soviet equivalent to the B-47 was the Tu-16 Badger. It first flew five years after its American counterpart but served much longer, into the 1990s. The Russians built more than fifteen hundred, some of which were sold to other countries. Shown here is a Badger C carrying a Kingfish AS-6 air-to- surface missile.

Manned by a crew of seven, the bomber was defended by three turrets, dorsal, ventral, and tail, each with twin 23-mm cannons, along with a fixed single nose gun. It entered service in early 1954.
