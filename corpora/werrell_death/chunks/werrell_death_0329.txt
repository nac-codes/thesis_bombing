For the war machine designed to deter, fight, and win a nuclear war against a nuclear armed superpower, failed to achieve victory in a (mostly) nonconven- tional war against a small Asian country. It was another frustrating war like Korea, only more costly and less unsuccessful. The United States prepared for war, deploying aircraft, troops, and ships for a possible invasion of the Caribbean island. SAC cancelled leaves, recalled person- nel, dispersed bombers to civilian airfields, increased the number of aircraft on ground alert, expanded the B-52 airborne alert, and put some two hundred ICBMs on alert.
