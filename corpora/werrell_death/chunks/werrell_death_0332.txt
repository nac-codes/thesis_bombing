might provoke a severe Chinese or Soviet response that might turn the conflict into another Korean War-or worse. Second, the Vietnamese Communists had already demonstrated great stamina in enduring the losses and punish- ment over the course of the ten-year war against France and would demonstrate the same resolve against the Americans over the next decade. While America was capable of bombing Vietnam back into the stone age, as Gen. Curtis LeMay's suggested in 1965, there is every indication the Vietnamese would have continued to fight. In any event the air war was executed far differently than the military wished. Instead of a sharp massive blow, civilian leaders gradually increased sorties and expanded the target list as Rolling Thunder moved slowly northward, not attacking targets in the key Hanoi-Haiphong area until June 1966. The decision makers established a thirty-mile buffer zone south of the Viet- nam-Chinese border and restricted zones centering on both Hanoi and Haiphong that could not be attacked without specific permission from the White House. Initially North Vietnamese airfields and SAM sites were left untouched, and throughout the war dikes and the population were off lim- its. Targets were authorized for two-week periods along with a specific number of sorties, and if the targets or sorties could not be serviced, the military had to go back to the White House for reauthorization, which was not always forthcoming ("use it or lose it"). There were also bombing halts ("pauses") for diplomatic purposes that permitted the North Vietnamese to rebuild, resupply, and regroup. This air campaign remains controversial. There are some (especially in the Air Force) who firmly believe that the bombing could have been decisive. "With the benefit of hindsight," a 1996 book boldly states, "it is clear that 'Rolling Thunder' could have been successful only if the civilian leaders in Washington had made a policy decision to use military power effectively"2 The milit
