C proved ill pre- pared for the campaign, lulled by its seven- year uncontested bombing experience. It had not run exercises against captured Soviet radars or SAMs or evaluated the viability of its tactics long used successfully in the benign skies over South Vietnam. The proposed strikes with one hundred bombers would be far different than those that employed no more than thirty bomb- ers at a time and required coordination with escorting fighters, defense suppres- sion aircraft, and ECM. The problem was complicated by the fact that the operation was run from Omaha, far from the field in distance, time, and perspective.
