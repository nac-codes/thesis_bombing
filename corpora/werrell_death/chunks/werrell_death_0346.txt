d considerable press atten- tion, and congressional hearings. Despite all of this, two decades after its less than glori- ous combat debut in Vietnam it flew in the Gulf War with advantages over other USAF aircraft operating in that conflict. The key to combining the ability to fly far and long with high speed was the variable geometry wing. The range goals required a large wing, while the speed goals mandated a small wing; a variable wing could do both. The United States got two such aircraft into the air, the Bell X-5 and the Grumman XF10F. The wings of both pivoted within the fuselage of the aircraft, and as the wing moved it caused a shift of both the center of lift and center of grav- ity, which induced aerodynamic changes. NASA modified the concept, pivoting only the outer portion of the wing and thus finessing the aerodynamic problems. This represented a giant breakthrough, as engi- neers calculated that to achieve the range and speed requirements with a fixed wing would require an aircraft of over 100,000 pounds, while a variable sweep- wing aircraft could weigh about 60,000 pounds. Other The F-111 story begins in March 1958, when the USAF put together specifica- tions for a Mach 2-plus, all-weather fighter capable of vertical or at least short takeoffs and landings. Tactical Air Command (TAC) wanted an aircraft capable of getting to Europe without refueling, operating out of small and rough fields, flying at supersonic speeds at altitude, and engaging in low-level, high-speed attack. Despite these daunting requirements, in 1959 NASA convinced TAC that this could be done using a new technology: a variable geometry (moveable or swing) wing. This resulted in a specific operational requirement released the next summer. The most important requirement that would shape (some would saw doom) the project was to achieve Mach 1.2 at  US 226 CHAPTER 9 THE 1960S AND 1970S that was enough for the decision makers. In retrospect it appears that Boeing designed an aircraft
