tage in penetrating enemy defenses. The F-111 entered combat in March 1968 in an operation code named Combat Lancer. The Air Force had high hopes for the new bomber as it promised to deliver bombs more accurately than any but laser equipped aircraft. In addition it was expected to be less vulnerable because of its high speed and low-altitude tactics and not require the large number of support aircraft as did conventional aircraft. Results, how- ever, were disappointing. The unit lost three bombers within a month9 and bombing accuracy was not good, an average error of 1,050 feet.10 On the positive side the crews reported only four cases of ground fire, none when flying at five hundred feet or less. The F-111 returned to combat four years later during Linebacker I, during which four were lost. SAMs were observed on eight missions, although only one of the sixteen fired caused any damage, and it was minor. Bombing accuracy was much better on this The new aircraft with its glittering tech- nology came at a high cost and a variety of problems. One of the most severe involved mating the wing, fuselage, and engine inlets. The latter proved to be a persistent and seri- ous issue causing engine stalls and seriously restricting air speed. GD installed new inlets in early 1968 that solved the stall prob- lems but increased drag and reduced range. The aircraft also experienced unexpected  228 CHAPTER 9 THE 1960S AND 19705 tour, although there was very little bomb damage assessment. The low-altitude radar altimeter (LARA) was the major cause of aircraft out of commission and believed to have contributed to two losses. During Linebacker II the GD bombers flew a total of 154 sorties, the bulk against airfields. At least six SAMs fired at the bomb- ers missed, while ground fire inflicted minor damage on four aircraft. Two F-111s were lost, one believed to have flown into the sea when its navigational equipment failed and one to small-arms fire that ruptured the hydraulic system, a
