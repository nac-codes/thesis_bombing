de its maiden flight in July 1967. The bomber showed its promise when in its first appearance it took top honors in bombing at SAC's 1970 combat competition and went on to win a number of these annual competitions. However, as with the other F-111 versions, it met considerable maintenance difficulties with engines, landing gear, and electronics. It was not until October 1971 that SAC got its first FB-111 bomb wing combat ready. The aircraft also experienced flying safety issues. For the bulk of the period prior to 1979 the F-111 and FB-111 accident rate exceeded that of the USAF, although over its lifetime, the FB-111 record was only bettered by the B-52 and B-2 and slightly by the B-1. The GD bomber could carry six munitions (SRAMs or free fall bombs), four underwing and two in an internal bomb bay. A June 1965 Air Force plan called for the acquisition of 263 FB-111s to provide the same capability as the B-52Cs through the "F" models they would replace. But in March 1969 this was cut to 76 FB-111s of the 563 F-111s built.The Aus- tralians bought two dozen F-111Cs and the RAF ordered, then cancelled, 50 F-111Ks. Penetration Aids The airmen pushed for devices to aid bomber penetration. Some of this was seen in World War II, most notably ECM, but also glide, guided, and powered bombs. One new avenue was to turn radar against the defenders by using decoys to mimic the radar signature of the bomber and proliferate radar returns and thus degrade enemy defenses. Convair developed the straight-wing Buck Duck to protect its B-36 bomber; however, due to slippages in its schedule and the approaching phase-out of the giant bomber, the USAF cancelled the project in January 1956. The USAF began work on the inter- continental-range, ground-launched Bull Goose (XSM-73) decoy project in Decem- ber 1952. The concept was rather grand, calling for the fielding of 2,300 missiles with the first unit becoming operational in the last half of 1960. The delta-winged mis- sile, which weighed
