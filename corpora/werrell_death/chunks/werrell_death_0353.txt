n Decem- ber 1952. The concept was rather grand, calling for the fielding of 2,300 missiles with the first unit becoming operational in the last half of 1960. The delta-winged mis- sile, which weighed seventy-seven hundred pounds including its five-hundred-pound payload, was to be launched with the aid of a rocket booster and powered over its four- thousand-mile range by a jet engine at a speed of Mach .85. The project was delayed by funding problems along with difficul- ties with the fiberglass-resin bonded wing, booster rockets, and sustainer engine. The Air Force began flight tests in June 1957 and construction of launch sites in August 1958. But that December the USAF can- celled the program because of finances, but most of all, because the missile was unable to produce a radar simulation of a B-52.  230 CHAPTER 9 THE 1960S AND 1970S aircraft. The airmen sought a better way to destroy their targets. During World War II the Germans used ballistic and cruise mis- siles and both the Americans and Germans experimented with and, to a limited degree, employed guided and unguided, powered and unpowered, air-to-surface missiles. These devices were designed to permit standoff attack and thus lessen vulnerability, but most of all to improve accuracy. The USAF did deploy one decoy mis- sile, the McDonnell Quail (GAM-72, later ADM-20). The Air Force conducted flight and glide tests in 1957, the first powered test in August 1958, and awarded a production contract in December. The Quail was a squat, tailless delta-wing aircraft with four vertical fins. Its relatively small size allowed eight to be carried on a B-52, four on a B-47 although the normal loading was half that. The Quail was designed to operate at thirty-five thousand to fifty thousand feet between Mach .75 and .9, and, depend- ing on launch altitude, reach between 360 and 450 nm. It could be programmed to make at least two changes in direction and one in speed during its forty-five- to fifty- five-minute flight.
