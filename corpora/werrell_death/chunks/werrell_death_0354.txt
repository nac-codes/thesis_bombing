d, depend- ing on launch altitude, reach between 360 and 450 nm. It could be programmed to make at least two changes in direction and one in speed during its forty-five- to fifty- five-minute flight. Its configuration, along with a one-hundred-pound ECM package, that later included Chaff and heat emitters, produced the image of the bomber. The first arrived at SAC in September 1960 and built to a peak in 1963 of almost five hundred. In that year the Air Force modified the decoy for low-level operations. As time passed the decoy became less effective because of reliability problems and improvements in Soviet defenses. In 1971 the SAC com- mander wrote that the Quail was only slightly better than nothing. During a test the next year pitting American radar against B-52s and Quails, the radar operators cor- rectly identified the B-52 twenty-one out of twenty-three times. Nevertheless, the Quail served in SAC until 1978. After the war Radioplane adapted its Crossbow target drone to aid bomber penetration. The straight-wing, jet-propelled craft carried a half-ton warhead close to the speed of sound to destroy enemy radars from beyond their range. A B-47 could carry four on underslung pylons. Tests began in December 1955 with the first powered flight in March 1956 and the first guided flight in May 1957. But the weapon could not meet speed specifications and Russian radar soon outranged it. These problems, along with the financial pressures, led to its cancellation in June 1957, just three weeks before it achieved its greatest success by fly- ing through its target's radar antenna. The Rascal program began in April 1946 intended for use on the B-36, B-47, and B-52. The 9-ton Bell rocket-powered missile was to have a range of one hundred nautical miles, have a speed of Mach 1.5 to 2.5, and carry a 3,000- to 5,000-pound warhead. It would use inertial guidance to get near the target, then in the final phase transmit radar images back to the mother ship for terminal guidance,
