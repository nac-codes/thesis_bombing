to 2.5, and carry a 3,000- to 5,000-pound warhead. It would use inertial guidance to get near the target, then in the final phase transmit radar images back to the mother ship for terminal guidance, and was expected to have a CEP of about five hundred feet. From the start SAC had doubts about the program and recommended its cancellation in February 1957. LeMay wanted a better missile but Bomber effectiveness was also aided by the addition of standoff weapons. Through- out most of its history the weapon of destruction of strategic bombing has been unguided, free fall bombs delivered by 231 was rebuffed by Headquarters USAF, which held that this was the best currently available. SAC conducted its first air launch in Febru- ary 1958, and although it was a success, later attempts were not. Meanwhile the Air Force trained crews and converted B-47s into missile carriers (DB-47). SAC was never enthusiastic about the missile because of reliability and guidance issues, the deg- radation in aircraft performance due to its external carriage, space required by its elec- tronics in the bomb bay, and the improving Soviet defenses. Cost was also a factor in the November 1958 decision to cancel Rascal in favor of the Quail and Hound Dog. year encountered major problems, centering on erratic performance, maintenance, and guidance reliability. Nevertheless the missile went on alert in July 1962, armed B-52G and H bombers, growing to a peak inven- tory of just under six hundred missiles in 1963. One major complaint was that Hound Dog's external carriage detracted from the bomber's flying performance. The North American ASM served between 1961 and 1976 when it was displaced by the SRAM. But that was not the plan. Ironically the best known of all of the USAF bomber munitions was never fielded. In the late 1950s the Air Force sought a long-range, air-launched ballistic missile, and in May 1959 Douglas won the contract. The GAM-87A Skybolt was a 5.5-ton, two-stage ballistic missile that
