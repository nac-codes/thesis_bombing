, which was not that significant since the missile carried a 4-megaton warhead. The B-52 could carry two of these weapons mounted on pylons between the fuselage and inboard engines, and use the missile engines to shorten takeoff. SAC launched its first Hound Dog in February 1960 and by the end of the  232 CHAPTER 9 THE 1960S AND 1970S 8-ton rocket-propelled missile with a range of one hundred or so miles. The missile was inertially guided and carried a 1.1-mega- ton warhead at a speed of Mach 3. It flew its first flight in early 1962 and went into service that same year. But it was difficult to handle because of its highly volatile fuel, and it proved difficult to integrate with the RAF bombers. In mid-1964 Blue Steel was adapted for low-level (below one thousand feet) launch, which considerably cut its range. felt misled, and had to scramble to keep their nuclear deterrent viable until the Polaris submarines and missile systems came into service. The short-range attack missile (SRAM AGM-69) emerged after Skybolt's cancella- tion. Boeing won the contract in October 1966 and the missile made its first powered flight in July 1969. The SRAM was a 2,200- pound, inertially guided, two-stage ballistic missile armed with a 200-kiloton warhead and a top speed of Mach 3.5. It could reach more than thirty nautical miles when launched from low level and perhaps one hundred nautical miles from a high-altitude launch with a CEP of twelve hundred feet. Initially the missile was intended to attack Soviet air defense systems; later its targets were expanded. B-52G and H models could carry twenty SRAMs (eight in an internal rotary launcher and twelve on two pylons mounted between the fuselage and inboard engines) and the FB-111A six (two internally and four on wing pylons). 12 The former became operational with the missile in January 1973 and the latter in August 1975. AGM-69A numbers peaked in the late 1970s at around fourteen hundred, and the missile served into 1990, when it was
