r became operational with the missile in January 1973 and the latter in August 1975. AGM-69A numbers peaked in the late 1970s at around fourteen hundred, and the missile served into 1990, when it was retired because of reliability (safety) issues with both motor and warhead. The Air Force cancelled an improved version for the B-1, as well as SRAM II in 1991. In contrast, the Soviets put a number of standoff weapons into service. Most of the Russian winged missiles came in at least two versions, an antishipping model armed with a conventional warhead and a land attack version fitted with a nuclear warhead. The AS-1 (U.S. code name) Kennel (NATO code name) was a scaled-down MiG-15 (without a canopy) that used command guidance, had a range of about sixty miles, and went into service on Badgers as early as 1956. It was followed in 1961 by the AS-2 Kipper that was also turbojet powered but with supersonic speed. It was fielded with either a conventional or nuclear warhead, and had a range of between 30 and 100 nm. In 1960 the AS-3 Kangaroo entered service, armed with a nuclear warhead. It was a 12-ton supersonic missile powered by turbojet with a range of 100 to 350 nm that was carried by the Bear. The AS-4 Kitchen became operational in 1964, was powered by rockets, and could reach Mach 3.5 over a 240-mile distance. It was fielded in three versions (nuclear, antishipping, and antiradia- tion) and was carried by both Blinders and Backfires. The rocket-powered, supersonic (Mach 1.2) AS-5 Kelt could carry either a conventional or nuclear warhead and was The United States was not the only country to develop standoff weapons. The British were forced to revise their plans when Skybolt was cancelled. The best they had in development was an inferior weapon, but a British one that could be made operational. The Blue Steel was an 233 fielded in an antiradiation version. It went into service in 1965 with a range of 125 nm on the Badger, which could carry two. The AS-6 Kingfish was
