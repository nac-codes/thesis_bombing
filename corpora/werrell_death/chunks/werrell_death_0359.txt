uld be made operational. The Blue Steel was an 233 fielded in an antiradiation version. It went into service in 1965 with a range of 125 nm on the Badger, which could carry two. The AS-6 Kingfish was faster (Mach 3.5) and longer ranged (300 nm) than the AS-5 and was built in numerous versions, includ- ing both an inertially guided nuclear and antiradiation model. It entered service in the early 1970s, two being carried by a Badger. The AS-15 Kent was a subsonic missile that looked and performed very much like the U.S. cruise missiles, that is, it carried a 200-kiloton nuclear warhead some eighteen hundred miles guided by an inertial-Dop- pler navigation and a terrain comparison system. It went into service on the Bear in the mid-1980s and later on the Blackjack. The AS-16 Kickback family had a version that was similar to the SRAM. The Tu-160 carried twenty-four in four launchers. The 2,600-pound rocket-propelled missile was inertially guided, carried a 350-kiloton war- head, had a top speed of Mach 5, and had a range of sixty miles; it was deployed in the late 1980s. Concern with the survival of U.S. bases led SAC to explore the poststrike recovery of bombers on dry lake beds. SAC found that two hundred locations met its minimum standards, and the command ran tests with the scheme in March and April 1962 that demonstrated it was viable for B-47, B-52, and KC-135 operations. However, SAC adopted other methods. SAC devised two tactics to lessen its vulnerability on the ground in response to Soviet ICBMs that took less than an hour between launch and detonation. In August 1950 LeMay stated that he wanted no more than fifteen aircraft on each SAC base, thus increasing the enemy's targeting problem and making more runways available and speeding the takeoff of the bomber force. On the debit side operating more bases less- ened maintenance efficiency and increased costs. In any case it was not until 1954 that SAC submitted a dispersal plan for B-52s and their tankers to be
