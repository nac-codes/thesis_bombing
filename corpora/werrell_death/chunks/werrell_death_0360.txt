e. On the debit side operating more bases less- ened maintenance efficiency and increased costs. In any case it was not until 1954 that SAC submitted a dispersal plan for B-52s and their tankers to be completed by mid- 1965. SAC began the dispersion in March 1958 but it was not completed until 1963 because base construction lagged behind aircraft production. In the event of increased international tension or strategic warning, the bombers would be further dispersed to civilian airfields and other military bases, a tactic first exercised in June 1960. New Tactics SAC had to deal with not only the grow- ing effectiveness of Soviet air defenses but also the threat of offensive strikes on its bases. One SAC response to the reduced warning time was to change its overall attack concept. Into the mid-1950s the air- men planned to base their bombers in the United States and, when ordered to war, stage them through overseas bases. This was reversed in a 1954 exercise which simulated launches from stateside bases directly to the targets and then recovery at overseas bases. A second tactic was to have the bomb- ers and tankers prepared to launch on very short notice in order to get airborne before a Soviet attack. SAC proposed the ground- alert system in October 1955, began tests in November 1956, and began implementation in October 1957. In July1957 SAC began sending B-47s to overseas bases (Reflex Action), to stand two weeks' alert.13 The goal  lys ock 234 CHAPTER 9 THE 1960S AND 1970S there were accidents although fortunately none resulted in a nuclear detonation. In January 1966 a refueling B-52 collided with a KC-135, both aircraft crashed, seven of the eleven crew were killed, and four nuclear weapons fell near the town of Palomares, Spain, and into the ocean. Two bombs underwent a nonnuclear explosion, con- taminating the soil, and two went deep into the ocean. All were recovered after a difficult eighty-day operation. Two years later a nuclear-armed B-52 crashed and bu
