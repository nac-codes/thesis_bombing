es had to be overcome, along with the challenges of high-speed, low-altitude navigation (50 to 60 percent of which was visual), crew fatigue and airsickness (as many as 15 percent of the crews suffering the lat- ter), and increased structural fatigue. The Air Force developed two maneuvers for nuclear delivery. Beginning in January 1956 it tested the spectacular low-altitude bomb system maneuver that had been developed for fighter bombers delivering nuclear weapons. This involved a low-level run at around 425 knots and five hundred feet, a 2.5-g pull-up with bomb release at the 45- to 60-degree point, and then an Immelman reverse maneuver. These maneuvers may have been militarily effec- tive but they also led to flying accidents and fatigue cracks in the wings. In just over thirty days in March-April 1958 there were six B-47 accidents. In response the Air Force suspended the tactic in April and initiated  us lock 236 CHAPTER 9 Chapter 10 WINGED AND BALLISTIC Operation Milk Bottle, May 1958 through June 1959, the goal of which was to inspect and repair the wing attachment to allow these high-stress maneuvers. Meanwhile SAC incorporated a less stressful tactic in October 1957. In the pop-up maneuver (code named Long Look) the bomber approached the target at normal altitude and then, outside of radar range, descended to five hundred feet until fifty miles from the target, where it pulled up, released its bomb at eighteen thousand feet, and exited the target with a steep dive to five hundred feet. SAC introduced a variation in September 1958, code named Short Look, in which the bomber bombed from five thousand feet. Combined with a drogue chute to slow the nuclear weapon and allow the bomber to exit the target, these were effective delivery tactics. With the first method the command achieved a CEP of 1,370 feet, and with the second 2,150 feet, compared with SAC's high-level accuracy in that same year (1960) of 1,300 feet. By March 1960 all B-47 and most B-52 crews were q
