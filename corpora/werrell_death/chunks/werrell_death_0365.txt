command achieved a CEP of 1,370 feet, and with the second 2,150 feet, compared with SAC's high-level accuracy in that same year (1960) of 1,300 feet. By March 1960 all B-47 and most B-52 crews were qualified for low- level operations. ECM or shutting down civilian air lanes) inhibited these efforts. To monitor accuracy SAC initially employed fixed radar bomb scoring (RBS) sites that could accurately plot where bombs would impact upon simulated release based on the bomber's location, course, air speed, and altitude. To diversify targets, in 1961 SAC deployed scoring radars on railroad trains that were moved from place to place and by the end of the year had three RBS trains in service. SAC also used annual bombing competition to encourage its crews and indicate what the very best could do. SAC also conducted a number of exer- cises. Some of these were to perfect means by which American air defenses could distinguish between SAC bombers entering and exiting the United States and enemy bombers as well as give SAC a measure of its tactics. Sky Shield I, an exercise flown in September 1960, involved 306 bomber sorties and indicated that even though low-level bombers flew above their planned wartime altitude (for safety purposes), 90 percent were undetected. Sky Shield III, in September 1962, involved over 530 bomber and tanker sorties. One portion of the exercise that SAC thought was relatively realistic consisted of ten B-58 and three B-52H bombers operating at high altitude and forty B-52s at low level protected by two dozen EB-47 ECM aircraft and sixteen simulated Quails (flown by B-47s) The defenses only intercepted seven of the bombers before they reached their targets, indicating SAC's ability to penetrate pre- sumably lesser Soviet defenses. SAC Training Training in the SAC was never ending, demanding, as realistic as possible, and strictly scrutinized. The objective was to ensure getting the weapons accurately on the target, despite weather, mechanical difficult
