as the desire to get a nuclear-armed ballistic missile into service as rapidly as possible to reassure both the American public and American allies. Both programs built on the progress of other missiles and were similar, both using for launch.6 The "E" and "F" models were somewhat improved over the "D" with upgraded boosters, a more powerful war- head, and all inertial guidance system that made possible a CEP of two nautical miles over a distance of sixty-three hundred nauti- cal miles. The Atlas ended its alert duties in June 1965 and went on to serve as a booster for space operations. For all of its faults the Atlas did establish the United States in the strategic missile business. The Titan quickly followed. After calls in 1954 for an alternate ICBM, in April 1955 the secretary of the Air Force authorized development of a second and parallel ICBM program, granting Martin the contract that September. Although Titan was similar to the Atlas with its liquid fuel, silo emplace- ment,7 and above-ground fueling and launch, it was more sophisticated. It was a two-stage missile that was larger, capable of more reliably carrying twice the payload a longer distance, and required less mainte- nance than the Atlas. However, the missile did not have an easy path to deployment because critics saw the Titan as a costly duplication of the Atlas and not as impres- sive as the emerging Minuteman. The Sputnik crisis changed all that. Titan made its first flight in February 1959 and had mixed success in testing and harsh public criticism, although two-thirds of the missiles achieved full success through June 1961. The missile became operational in May 1962 and served until June 1965, when the transition to the Titan II was completed. The race to get ballistic missiles operational led to two American intermediate-range ballistic missiles, the Army's Jupiter and the Air Force's Thor (shown here). The two were similar in construction and performance. Both were deployed, the Jupiter in
