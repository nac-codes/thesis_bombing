ssile manned by crews of the host nation and the warheads under U.S. control. The two missiles were only briefly in service, for as part of the resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis and with the introduc- tion of ICBMs into the strategic inventory, the two IRBMs were deactivated by the end of 1963. The Thor later served as a launch vehicle in the U.S. space program. The Army built the Jupiter on its Redstone program, which had its start in 1951 and was well along and provided a test vehicle in addition to test facilities. The Jupiter drew ahead of its Air Force rival and completed a twelve-hundred-mile flight in May 1957. The Thor had testing problems with successive failures: its first attempted flight exploded on the launch pad in January 1957, and its was not until its fifth attempt, only weeks before the Sputnik flight, that it achieved a successful flight of thirteen hundred miles. It appeared that one of the two IRBM programs would be axed, but the urgency following the Sputnik launch changed everything, encouraging the president to authorize production of both missiles. (Right) The U.S. Navy also developed cruise missiles and deployed the Chance Vought Regulus I. It looked and performed like the USAF's Matador, and in fact used the same turbojet engine. Regulus became operational in 1955 and served for almost ten years.

Similar to the AAF/USAF, immediately after World War II the Navy experimented with winged subsonic missiles and like the Air Force, it favored winged missiles over ballistic missiles. These included the modi- fied German V-1 (code named Loon), and its own Gorgon and Pollux, missiles pow- ered by a variety of power plants-rocket, turbojet, and pulsejet. These led nowhere. However, in response to the AAF contract to Martin in
