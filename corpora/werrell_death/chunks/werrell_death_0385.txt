on as it threatened the Navy's successful World War II way of fighting wars with carrier-based aviation, surface forces, and submarines. The appointment of Adm. Submarine navigation was critical to the concept as the missileers had to accurately know the launch location if the missile was to hit its target. The Navy attempted a num- ber of different devices (the inertial system from the Navaho cruise missile, celestial, radiometric from the sun or moon, sea floor maps, Loran C, and satellite). Another critical problem for the submariners was commu- nications. Nuclear weapons demand tight control in both peace and war, which is dependent on rapid and reliable commu- nications. There are physical problems with  252 CHAPTER 10 MISSILES LOCKHEED ENG MOCI-UP radio communications with a boat cruising beneath the ocean's surface. Antenna buoys, trailing wire antennas, various frequencies, and airborne relay stations were all employed. The development of the missile itself was greatly aided by timing. The fear of a strategic nuclear bombardment gap open- ing between the United States and Soviet Union, first bomber and then missile, accentuated by Sputnik, broke open fund- ing that had been monopolized by the Air Force. There were also two technical break- throughs in the 1950s. The first, the devel- opment of smaller, lighter nuclear warheads, allowed smaller, lighter missiles. The other, solid-propellant fuel, produced a safer missile that was easier to handle, store, and maintain. The first attempted Polaris test launch in September 1958 failed, and success was not achieved until the sixth try in April 1959. The first submerged submarine launch came in July 1960, and the first patrol began that November. The submarine was armed with sixteen of the two-stage Lockheed Polaris A-1 missiles, which could carry a 600-kilo- ton warhead within one mile of its aiming point at one thousand miles. The Polaris was brought into the SIOP and by the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis the
