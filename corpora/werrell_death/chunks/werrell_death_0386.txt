-1 missiles, which could carry a 600-kilo- ton warhead within one mile of its aiming point at one thousand miles. The Polaris was brought into the SIOP and by the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis the Navy had nine operational Polaris boats. The Polaris A-1 went into service quickly but was an unreliable missile that only served until September 1965. It was followed by the heavier A-2, which had a The Polaris A-3 (left) shown alongside its successor, the larger and more capable Poseidon (right). The last version of the Poseidon (C-3) weighed twice as much as the Polaris, had twice the payload and twice the accuracy, and could deliver six to fourteen warheads. It was first deployed in 1971. (U.S. Naval Institute Photo Archive) 253 range of fifteen hundred nautical miles with its 800-kiloton (later 1-megaton) warhead. The Navy's goal was to improve missile reliability, which it did, along with improv- ing the second-stage engine. It became operational in June 1962. Concerned by the prospect of Soviet antiballistic missile (ABM) defense, during the 1961-62 time frame the Navy considered penetration aids for the submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). The A-3 quickly followed with its first flight in August 1962 and became operational in September 1964. The A-3 was heavier and longer ranged (2,500 nm) than its predecessors. The additional range had strategic consequences, giving the sub- marines more sea room for maneuver, and allowing the Navy in December 1964 to begin its first Pacific SLBM patrol. The A-3 featured three 200-kiloton warheads, termed multiple reentry vehicles (MRV) with a CEP of .5 nm.11 Later the Navy substituted penetration aids for one of the warheads The Navy retired the A-3 in November 1979. Polaris missiles armed forty-one of the first three classes of nuclear ballistic mis- sile submarines. hit separate targets at a range of 2,500 to 3,200 nm with a CEP of .25 nm. It was first deployed in March 1971. The thirty-one Lafayette-class boats were
