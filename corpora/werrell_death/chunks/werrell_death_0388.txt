reentry vehicle), which could The manufacturer began development of the three-stage C-4 version in November 1971 and produced a weapon with a range of four thousand miles that could deliver eight 100-kiloton warheads. Lockheed incorporated a number of innovations to allow these marked improvements in per- formance. The builder used new materials, lighter components, advanced propulsion, and a deployable "aerospike" that reduced  254 CHAPTER 10 MISSILES aerodynamic drag. There were efforts in the 1970s to develop a common missile for both Air Force and Navy use, which collapsed by the end of 1978 when studies indicated only a relatively small cost saving associated with greater risks. Accuracy improved as Trident's stellar inertial system allowed a CEP of .12 to .25 nm. It first flew in January 1977 and was deployed in October 1979 on the existing SSBNs years before the Trident submarines went to sea. The push for more accuracy continued despite the policy of MAD. The prolifera- tion of weapons, the promising technology, and unease with a mutual suicide pact were factors in this continued effort. The Navy resisted but was caught up in it in the 1980s. Actually the move toward more accurate weapons was endorsed at the highest level in January 1974, when President Nixon signed a memo that called for the option of small strikes on military targets, a move that reinforced the DoD's move toward greater accuracy. President Ronald Reagan was more outspoken against MAD, advocat- ing a policy of counterforce and ballistic missile defense. In 1980 the Navy began a program to provide a SLBM to fully use the larger space in the Trident submarine. This led to the three-stage Trident II that would supple- ment the USAF's MX in a counterforce strategy. The Trident II D-5 is considerably larger than the C-4 and can reach out over four thousand miles with ten to fourteen warheads with an accuracy of .06 nm (365 feet).12 It was initially deployed in 1990. In contrast to the Trident s
