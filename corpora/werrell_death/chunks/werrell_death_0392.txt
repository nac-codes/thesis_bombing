The invention of a small turbofan jet engine and a new and accurate navigation system combined to produce a very accurate, long-range, subsonic missile. The first air- launched cruise missile, the AGM-86A (right), was enlarged into the 1,500- nm Boeing AGM-86B (left), which was armed with a nuclear warhead and deployed on B-52s. (USAF) (Bottom left) The U.S. Navy developed a sea-launched cruise missile comparable to the air-launched cruise missile, but it was more versatile as it could be launched from submerged submarines, surface ships, trucks, and aircraft. The General Dynamics Tomahawk was first fielded as a conventionally armed antiship missile in March 1983 and the next year as a nuclear-armed, land- attack missile. (USN) MISSILES 257 The joint office ran a competition between GD and Boeing to pick the ALCM builder. Each company attempted ten flights and each had six successes, with the unanimous decision for Boeing announced in March 1980.The AGM-86B became operational in December 1982 on B-52Gs, and more than seventeen hundred were delivered to the Air Force. The missile can deliver a 200-kiloton warhead over fifteen hundred nautical miles at Mach .75. The B-52 can carry twelve ALCMs externally and eight internally. To comply with the SALT II treaty, Boeing added a strakelet (a faring connecting the wing to the fuselage) onto the B-52G and a spade antenna onto the B-52H that distinguishes the ALCM carrying B-52s from other B-52s. The Air Force also considered using converted airliners to carry 48 to 90 ALCMs, an idea that died in August 1979. The B-1 is able to carry ALCMs. quite different in shape, distinguished by its sharp nose, flush intake, vertical tail below the fuselage, and swept forward wings. The Air Force intended to replace the AGM- 86B with the ACM, but the 2,500 missile buy was reduced at the end of the Cold War to 460. In March 2007 the Air Force announced it was retiring the missile. The Tomahawk had wide service. The Navy deployed three ve
