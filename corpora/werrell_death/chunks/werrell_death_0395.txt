U.S. Navy's Tomahawk. The missile was deployed briefly to Europe until arms reduction agreements in the late 1980s led to its withdrawal and destruction. (USAF) The three-stage Boeing Minuteman went on alert in October 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The U.S. Air Force deployed three versions of the missile that, along with submarine- launched ballistic missiles and strategic bombers, formed the core of the United States' nuclear triad and nuclear deterrent. Shown here is a Minuteman I launch in September 1959. (USAF) operational in December 1962 and the improved IB version in September of the next year. Boeing built 150 Minuteman IA missiles and 650 IBs. The Minuteman II began development in October 1963, made its first flight in September 1964, and went on alert in May 1966. It was slightly larger than Minuteman I, had a longer range, and carried a 1.2-megaton warhead to a CEP of one nautical mile. It also carried penetration aids as did the later versions of the Atlas and Titan. By decade's end the Air Force had five hundred Minuteman Is and five hun- dred Minuteman IIs on alert. Minuteman III was not far behind, beginning development in December 1964. It had greater range, payload, and accuracy and was the first ICBM with multiple warheads able to carry two to three 170- to 375-kiloton warheads out to eight thousand nautical miles with an accuracy of eight hundred feet. The Air Force declared Minuteman III operational in December 1970 and put it on alert the next month. By July 1975 the United States had 450 Minuteman II, 550 Minuteman III, and 54 Titan IIs in service. The Air Force ran into problems siting its ICBMs. As more accurate and more powerful enemy missiles became avail- able, one possible defense was mobility that would make an enemy's effort to disarm the United States much more difficult. The USAF had studied mobility for both Atlas and Titan in 1956 but concluded it was not feasible. The concept reemerged in September 1958 when the Air Force
