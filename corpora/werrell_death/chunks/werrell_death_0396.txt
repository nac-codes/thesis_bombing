arm the United States much more difficult. The USAF had studied mobility for both Atlas and Titan in 1956 but concluded it was not feasible. The concept reemerged in September 1958 when the Air Force con- sidered placing Minuteman on rails. SAC was a strong proponent of this concept, in February 1959 advocating mounting three hundred of four hundred Minutemen on trains and sent a requirement to the Air Staff for deploying an operational railroad-based Minuteman unit no later than January 1963. Tests between June and August 1960 proved satisfactory but studies uncovered operating and logistical problems. President Kennedy deferred the mobile Minuteman concept in March 1961 and in December 1961 the DoD cancelled the project, citing high cost. Instead the Air Force emplaced all the Minutemen in hardened silos, designed to withstand 200 psi overpressure, which were less expensive. However, the railroad idea was not entirely dead.  260 CHAPTER 10 SILES The MX (missile experimental, later named Peacekeeper) development began in April 1972. It overcame problems involving domestic politics, arms control, and cost to enter service. In October 1981 Reagan set out a program that called for the deploy- ment of at least one hundred MX missiles. The solid-fuel missile was very large, heavy, and capable of delivering ten indepen- dently targeted 300-kiloton warheads over fifty-two hundred nautical miles.17 The first test flight in June 1983 went well, and ten Peacekeepers became operational in December 1986. (Left) The four- stage Peacekeeper (MX) encountered considerable opposition and controversy regarding basing before being sited in former Minuteman silos. The U.S. Air Force declared the missile operational in December 1986 and fielded fifty that were deactivated in the early 2000s. This Peacekeeper launch in 1987 from a modified Minuteman silo reveals the installation's heavy hexagonal door. (U.S. Naval Institute Photo Archive) the MX deployment at fifty until the administrat
