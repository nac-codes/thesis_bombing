e. In 1958 the air service proposed a force of sixteen hundred Minutemen, while Curtis LeMay wanted ten thousand. In December 1964 Secretary of Defense McNamara set the ICBM force at one thousand Minutemen and fifty-four Titan IIs, a number that stood for many years. While the U.S. ICBM numbers Soviet Missiles The Soviets had great incentive to pursue missile technology because of the great American strategic advantage based on tech- nical and combat experience with strategic bombing and the U.S. lead with nuclear weapons. Just as jet propulsion offered the Russians a way to leap frog the existing bomber imbalance, missiles presented a simi- lar opportunity. This the Soviets pursued, for while they had suffered greater losses than any other country in World War II, they possessed vast human and natural resources, and a determination to be a superpower. Russian strategic programs started with the help from stolen U.S. nuclear secrets, copied B-29s, and German technicians and V-2s. This outside boost should not be overem- phasized, as Westerners tend to do, for the Soviets had a strong scientific establishment, a long and productive history with rockets, and determination. Consequently they took advantage of the new technology and were the first to launch an ICBM, space satellite, man in space, and SLBM. While this lead did not immediately translate into military superiority over the Americans, it did estab- lish the springboard for the Soviets to reach strategic equivalence by the mid-1970s. The Russians were quick to jump into the missile field.
