Fint launched in May 1957, its first suc- cesful flight in August of that year covered four thousand miles, months before the first stage KCBM became operational in 1963 and went out of service ie 1976.

The initial SS-6 had an average range of forty-five hundred nautical miles with a CEP of over two nautical miles. less range but accuracy equivalent to that of the Atlas. The major threat posed by the missile was its huge thrust, far exceeding American engines. Although it was a flawed military weapon requiring twenty hours to launch, it nevertheless became operational in December 1959, shortly after the Atlas went on alert. The Soviets improved the missile with a lighter warhead, more power- ful engines, and a new guidance system that extended the SS-6's range to sixty-five hundred nautical miles. Flight tests from December 1959 to July 1960 led to the missile deployment in the early 1960s. It was taken off alert by mid-1968 and went on to serve well as the booster for Sputnik and more than a thousand other space shots. and began developmme an 1958 The fire attempted launch in October 1900 c창nd with an explosion dut dneround the mis- sie and killed one hundred, ancuding the head of Strategic Rochas Foron The first successful test of the two-stage liquid-fudied missile occurmd in April 1961, and the ICBM went on alert in November 1984.
