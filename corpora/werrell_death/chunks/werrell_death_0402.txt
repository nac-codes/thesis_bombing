However, it took almost three hours to fire the music.At in maximum deployment in 1968 che Sonim had 69 misiles in silos and another 128 in The Sore pushed the technology, as the Sont leader, Nikita Khrushchev, liked misin and found the Rusia bomber The next Soviet ICBM, the R-16 (SS-7 Saddler), was approved in December 1956  264 CHAPTER 10 SILES coffins. These were gradually decommis- sioned starting in 1971 with the last leaving service in 1977. The R-9 (SS-8 Sasin) was another liquid-fueled ICBM. Proposed in April 1958, it began flight tests in April 1961 that extended into February 1964 and reached an initial operating capability in November 1963 at soft sites and in April 1964 at hard ones. It probably went on alert in July 1965. The two-stage missile was able to deliver a 3,500-pound warhead more than six thousand nautical miles with a one nautical mile CEP. Later the ICBM could be hot launched from silos. The missiles were inac- tivated from soft positions in 1971, while those in silos served on until 1976. The two-stage R-36 (SS-9 Scarp), also a liquid-fueled ICBM, began flight tests in September 1963. The silo-based missile (hardened to withstand 500 psi overpres- sures) could be fired in three to five minutes. The Soviets tested the SS-9 in four versions, two with unitary warheads (with warheads of 5 to 10 megatons), one fractional orbit (see below), and a fourth with three war- heads. The single-warhead missile became operational in 1966 and the multiple- warhead version in October 1970. With the lighter-weight warhead the missile had a range of fifty-five hundred nautical miles. American intelligence saw it as a significant improvement over previous Soviet ICBMs. It was decommissioned in 1978. While almost all of the Soviet and Amer- ican strategic weapons had a counterpart in the other camp, one system did not. In 1961 th
