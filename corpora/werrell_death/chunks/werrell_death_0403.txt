provement over previous Soviet ICBMs. It was decommissioned in 1978. While almost all of the Soviet and Amer- ican strategic weapons had a counterpart in the other camp, one system did not. In 1961 the Soviets began work on a fractional Another Soviet liquid-propelled two-stage ICBM was the SS-9 (Scarp). It began flight testing in September 1963 and was decommissioned in 1978. (U.S. Naval Institute Photo Archive) orbital bombardment system (FOBS), an orbiting nuclear weapon that could be brought down onto a target on demand. The advantages were unlimited range and the ability to avoid known radar coverage. The threat was made loud and clear by Pre- mier Khrushchev in an August 1961 public statement. The Soviets tested the R-360 in orbit and apparently conducted two dozen tests between December 1965 and August 1971. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty banned nuclear warheads in space but did allow the missile to be deployed. The Soviets flew two missiles a year for a time and began deploy- ment in November 1968 to eighteen silos. SALT II banned the weapon, which was phased out in January 1983. the missile on alert in 1975. A second version carried one warhead, and another model carried four warheads. The mis- sile had a range of about 5,500 nm and a CEP of .5 nm. The SALT I led to its dismantlement. The rival to the SS-17 to replace the SS-11 was the UR-100N (SS-19 Stiletto), also a two-stage, liquid-fueled ICBM. It was deployed in three versions, two with multiple warheads (six 550 kilotons each) and one with a single warhead (2.5 to 5 megatons). The missile has a range of 5,400 nm with a CEP of .5 nm. It was tested and deployed in the same time frame as the SS-17. As a consequence of the SALT II Treaty Russia must either dismantle the multiple-warhead missile or convert it to a single-warhead configuration. Development of the two-stage liquid-fuel UR-100 (SS-11 Sego) began in the early 1960s, and it was deployed in a variety of versions. The first entered service in 1966 w
