a single-warhead configuration. Development of the two-stage liquid-fuel UR-100 (SS-11 Sego) began in the early 1960s, and it was deployed in a variety of versions. The first entered service in 1966 with a CEP of 1 nm. Later versions extended range to 6,500 nm, improved accuracy to .6 nm, and employed penetration aids, as well as appearing in one version with multiple warheads (three) with some reduction in range. The Soviets began to deploy these in the early 1970s into simple silos hardened to withstand overpressures of 400 to 700 psi. More SS-11s were deployed than any other Soviet ICBM.The missile was eliminated by SALT I and was gone by 1996. The R-36M (SS-18 Satan) was the replacement for the R-36. It was a large, two-stage, liquid-fueled missile fitted with either a massive single warhead (18 to 25 megatons) or multiple warheads (eight to ten with a yield of .5 to 1.5 megatons each). It was deployed in superhardened silos (esti- mated to be able to withstand overpressures of 4,000 psi or possibly 6,000 psi) and used a cold launch. Testing began in the early 1970s, and it was deployed in 1975. This missile was greatly feared by the United States because of its range (eighty-six hundred nautical miles), multiple warheads (eight to ten), and accuracy (820-foot CEP) and became the focus of American arms limitations. START II banned land-based multiple-warhead systems and the SS-18, although the Russians were allowed to keep the silos, albeit downsized to prohibit accommodation of that missile. The UR-100MR (SS-17 Spanker) is another two-stage, liquid-fueled ICBM, most notable as the first Soviet missile to employ cold launch and to carry MIRVs. It was sized to use the silos of the SS-11 it replaced. The Soviets tested the first ver- sion, which carried MIRVs (four .3- to .75- megaton yield), in the early 1970s and put  lock 266 CHAPTER 10 rop MISSILES M The Soviets also fielded a number of solid-fueled ICBMs. The first was the RT-2 (SS-13 Savage).
