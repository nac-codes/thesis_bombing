The three-stage missile had a 5,500-nm range and could deliver its single warhead with a CEP of .7 to 1 nm. Flight tested in the mid-1960s, the SS-13 was deployed into hardened silos late in the decade. The Russians phased out the ICBM in 1996. ICBM. The solid-fueled Topol-M reportedly has a 5,700-nm range with a CEP of .2 nm and was first launched in December 1994. The missile's deployment has been restricted by both START II and the shortage of funds in the post-Soviet state. Nevertheless the SS-27 went on alert in December 1997. It was fielded in both mobile and silo ver- sions, in a single-warhead configuration. The RT-2PM (SS-25 Sickle) is a three- stage, solid-fueled, road-mobile ICBM. Road mobility, while more expensive than fixed sites, presents a more difficult target. The Topol was authorized in 1977, not flight tested until 1985, and went on alert in 1988, and by the end of 1996 the Rus- sians had 360 of these missiles in service. Although tested with multiple warheads, the SS-25 was deployed with a single warhead. The RT-2 UTTH (SS-27, no NATO designation) is a single-warhead, mobile The RT-23 (SS-24 Scalpel) is a rail mobile and silo-based, solid-propellant, three-stage ICBM. It carries ten warheads (550 kilotons each) and is cold launched. The rail version will be eliminated under the START II agreement and the silo ver- sion will replace the SS-19. Development of the SS-24 began in January 1969 but did not achieve alert status (rail version) until October 1987. (Each train carried three missiles with their associated equipment and personnel.) The silo version was first test The SS-13 (Savage) was a three-stage ICBM that served until 1996. It is significant as the first Soviet solid-propellant ICBM.
