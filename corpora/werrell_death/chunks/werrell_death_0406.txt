The SS-13 (Savage) was a three-stage ICBM that served until 1996. It is significant as the first Soviet solid-propellant ICBM. (U.S. Naval Institute Photo Archive) In March 1994 Secretary of Defense William Perry (in dark coat and hat) visited the ICBM base at Pervomaysk, Ukraine, where he saw this SS-24 Scalpel) silo. The missile was also deployed on rail, carried ten MIRV warheads, and was later dismantled in accordance with arms control agreements. (U.S. Naval Institute Photo Archive) flown in July 1986 and began deployment in November 1989. It has a CEP of .1 nm and a range of 5,400 nm. The first Soviet SLBM was a naval- ized version of the well-known Scud, the R-11FM (SS-1b Scud), deployed on the Zulu-class diesel-powered submarines. Whereas the first U.S. SSBNs mounted six- teen ballistic missiles amidships, the Soviets fitted two R-11FMs inside the sail. In Sep- tember 1955 the Soviets launched the first R-11FM from a surfaced submarine. The missile's range and accuracy were limited (90 nm and .8 nm CEP), but the project was less important as a weapon than as a step toward deploying SLBMs. In any case the Soviets 267 beat the U.S. Navy, getting the missile to sea in a long-range test patrol in August 1956, with deployment on Zulu- and Golf-class submarines beginning in February 1959. The Soviets encountered reliability prob- lems with their submarines, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles. The Golf-class submarine, another diesel-powered boat, was designed from the keel up for SLBMs. Compared to the Zulu class it was one and half times larger (displacement), slightly slower, could dive one and half times deeper, had greater endurance, and was quieter. As in the Zulu class the missiles were carried in the sail and fired from the surface. The first three 47 - 25 И Л  268 CHAPTER 10 class became operational in October 1960 within months of the much better perform- ing American SSBN. The Hotel-class boats were later rearmed with R-21 missiles, which could be
