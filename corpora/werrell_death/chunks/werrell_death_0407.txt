The Hotel-class boats were later rearmed with R-21 missiles, which could be fired submerged. The first of these modified submarines (Hotel II class) became operational in April 1964. In all the Soviets built eight of these boats. of the class (Golf I and II) were armed with three R-11FMs; later boats were armed with three R-13s. The latter (SS-N-4 Sark), another liquid-fueled missile, carried a 500-kiloton nuclear warhead out to a range of 320 nm. Submarines with reduced-range missiles became operational in 1958, with the full-range model in 1960. By the start of 1975 the Soviets had phased out both the Golf I class and the R-13. The Soviets authorized the Yankee-class submarine in 1962. It was larger than its predecessors, quieter, faster, deeper div- ing, and more capable, and it was the first Russian submarine comparable to its U.S. counterparts. The nuclear-powered boat was designed to carry sixteen R-27 (SS-N-6 Serb) missiles. This is another single-stage liquid-propellant missile with a range of thirteen hundred to sixteen hundred nauti- cal miles. However, while it was fielded with a single warhead, it is notable for its multiple warheads, two or three in the upgraded R-27U, which went into service in January 1971. The latter version also was deployed with a single warhead that had A refitted Golf boat (Golf II) became operational in May 1963 and went to sea armed with three R-21 (SS-N-5 Serb) mis- siles. The R-21 had a range of 700 nm and a CEP of 1.5 nm and was most notable as the first Soviet missile that could be launched submerged. The R-13 and R-21 also armed the next Soviet submarine class (Hotel), a modification of the first Soviet nuclear- powered boat (November class). The missiles were mounted directly behind the sail and initially surface launched, however, the Soviets upgraded the boats for submerged launch by December 1963.
