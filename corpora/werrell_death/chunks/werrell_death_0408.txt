uclear- powered boat (November class). The missiles were mounted directly behind the sail and initially surface launched, however, the Soviets upgraded the boats for submerged launch by December 1963. The first of this The SS-N-5 was the first Soviet missile to be launched from a submerged submarine. It was deployed on the diesel Golf II boats and later on the nuclear- powered Hotel-class submarines. (U.S. Naval Institute Photo Archive) The Soviets deployed the SS-N-6 on Yankee boats that could carry sixteen missiles. (U.S. Naval Institute Photo Archive) increased range and accuracy. The first boat of the Yankee class was launched in 1964 and became operational in late 1967.The Soviets built thirty-four of this class. In late 1982 some of the Yankee-class boats were enlarged and armed with SS-N-24 cruise missiles. Between 1982 and 1991 other Yan- kee boats were armed with twenty to forty launchers of SS-N-21 (Grenade) cruise mis- siles and became known as Yankee Notch subs. In compliance with arms-limitations treaties, the Yankee-class submarines were removed from operations by 1994. MISSILES 269 The first Delta I-class submarine went into service in December 1972. This class was larger than the Yankee class and armed with a dozen R-29 missiles. The SS-N-8 Sawfly is a two-stage liquid-fueled mis- sile armed with a single warhead. It had a range of 4,200 nm, carried decoys, and had an estimated .5 nm CEP.The system was declared operational in March 1974. The Soviets built eighteen of these boats, followed by four Delta II boats, the first of which entered service in September 1975. These had 15 percent greater displacement than the Delta I and carried four additional R-29s. The Delta III class carries sixteen R-29R (SS-N-18 Stingray) missiles and DWCPCA.N WUDCAL NOWNVANSY went into operation in 1976. These missiles are armed with three to seven MIRVs that can reach 3,500 to 4,300 nm, depending on the number of warheads. The Soviets built fourteen of this class. In 19
