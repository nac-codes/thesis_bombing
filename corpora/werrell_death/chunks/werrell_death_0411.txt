iod through 2010. Other Nations China is thus far the last nation to have deployed ICBMs. The DF-3 program began in November 1961 before technical and economic factors forced its cancellation in 1963. (In October 1964 the Chinese exploded their first nuclear weapon.) The Chinese first tested the DF-5 in September 271 1971, but it did not undergo full-scale flight testing until 1978 or 1979; in May 1980 it flew six thousand miles. The two-stage liquid-propelled missile could carry a single 3-megaton warhead to a range exceeding five thousand nautical miles and entered service in 1981. The Chinese began devel- opment of the DF-5A in 1983. It had both longer range (seven thousand nautical miles) and better accuracy and entered service in the mid-1980s. The missile delivers a single 2-megaton warhead, although the Chinese are working on a multiple-warhead configuration. Initially the DF-5 was stored in mountain tunnels and moved outside for fueling and launch, all of which took about two hours. In contrast the DF-5As are sited in silos. The Chinese deployed the first in 1981 and has fielded a small number of ICBMs, with most published estimates at twenty to twenty-four. The Chinese are developing three-stage solid-propelled ICBMs as well as solid-fuel SLBMs. The Chinese have a handful of submarines and put a two-stage solid-propellant missile (JL-1) with a nine-hundred-nautical-mile range into operational service in 1988 after demonstrating a submerged launch. There is some evidence that the Chinese are developing a multiple-warhead submarine- launched ICBM. No countries other than Britain, China, Russia, and the United States have deployed ICBMs or SLBMs with intercontinental range, although a number of others possess nuclear weapons. The French have tested nuclear weapons and deployed a nuclear triad consisting of a small number of sub- marines, silo-based IRBMs, and thirty-four or so Mirage IV bombers.
