Other countries  us 230 CHAPTER 10 272 MISSILES that have tested nuclear weapons include India, North Korea, and Pakistan. Israel also has nuclear weapons and Iran is suspected of pressing forward in this area. North Korea has demonstrated missile design, development, and production ability by fielding the No-dong, a medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM), which it has sold to Iran (Shahab-3) and Pakistan (Ghauri II). It is working on a much longer range mis- sile named Taep'o dong-2, which failed in a July 2006 test. In October 2006 the North Koreans conducted a nuclear test that also failed. The North Koreans have aided both Iran and Pakistan with nuclear and missile technology. concluded SALT II, which reduced the number of strategic launchers to twenty- four hundred. While never ratified because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, both countries observed its restrictions. In July 1991 the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) reduced the number of war- heads to six thousand on sixteen hundred launchers. Both sides then took unilateral moves, which included the United States taking Minuteman II off of alert, curtail- ing bomber alert status, stopping develop- ment of MX and Midgetman, canceling the SRAM II ASM, and, in December 1993, beginning destruction of Minuteman II silos. This reduced U.S. ICBMs to 50 MX and 450 Minuteman III missiles. In January 1993 START II went further, limiting each side to 3,000 to 3,500 warheads by 2003 and banning multiple warheads.22 Later talks led to an agreement (SALT III) in 1997 to further reduce the warhead limit to 2,000 to 2,500 by December 2007. Shortly thereafter the Russians indicated their willingness to go even lower, to 2,000 to 2,500.23 In May 2003 the two parties agreed in the Strategic Offensive Reduction Treaty to reduce warheads to 1,700 to 2,200 by 2012.
