albeit in a scaled-down and renamed version (Sentinel became Safeguard). The system encountered fierce domestic opposition, winning Senate approval only with a tie-breaking vote of the vice president. Playing against stereotype and with the thawing of the Cold War, the Republicans traded off the Safeguard for a treaty that limited the numbers of offensive weapons and ABMs. A 1972 Soviet-Ameri- can treaty limited ABM to two sites in each country, reduced in 1974 to one each. The Air Force declared its one ABM installa- tion operational in September 1975, but in January 1976 the JCS, judging it to be too costly and of questionable value, ordered it dismantled. The Soviets chose to maintain their one site deployed in the Moscow area. BMD, as it later came to be called, was inoperative in the United States but not dead. It was considered for protection of the MX ICBM and then got a new lease on life when Ronald Reagan came to office. In March 1983 he proposed a space-based program called the Strategic Defense Initia- tive (SDI), better known to the critics and 275 The United States has devoted much effort to an airborne laser (ABL) system, but made more progress with the less demanding theater missile defense systems. Events in the late 1980s spurred BMD.The specter of nations such as Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Pakistan, and Syria deploying missiles and weapons of mass destruction was unnerving. Democratic president Bill Clinton attempted to derail, or at least stall, BMD, but Republican control of Congress made this difficult. BMD became a partisan issue with the Republicans putting the earli- est possible deployment of a cost effective system into their 1994 political program, "Contract with America." President Clin- ton was sustained by a razor slim vote in the House (222 to 218) in February 1995 and by a National Intelligence Estimate in November that stated that aside from the declared nuclear powers, there was no ICBM threat against the United States over th
