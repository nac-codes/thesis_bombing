and the rise of small, aggressive nation states. What role strategic weapons and BMD will play in this environment remains to be seen. However, these concerns will focus attention on the issue of strategic bombardment. A LIMITED FUTURE? T he implosion of the Soviet Union reordered the world balance of power and recast the threat to the United States. Nuclear deterrence and retaliation seemed less of a priority while conventional and unconventional conflicts came to the fore. Signs of these changes were the 1991 Gulf War and the phasing out of Strategic Air Command in May 1992. The next month SAC and TAC were combined into a new organization, Air Combat Command. The historic organizational distinction between strategic and tactical aircraft had officially dissolved, as the role of the strategic bomber declined. How did these events unfold? The B-1 Lancer The USAF's unsuccessful experience with the B-58, FB-111, and B-70 did not stop SAC's quest for farther, faster, and higher flying bombers, what by 1964 became U.s. known as the advanced manned strategic aircraft (AMSA). The influence of politics is apparent throughout the bomber's his- tory. The Johnson administration (and especially Secretary of Defense McNamara) was skeptical of AMSA and embraced the FB-111, a position reversed by the Nixon administration, which cut the FB-111 buy and accelerated the AMSA, which in April 1969 became the B-1. In June 1970 the Air Force ordered 244 from North American Rockwell with which to replace the entire B-52 fleet. The new bomber, officially the Lancer but known as the Bone (B-one), made its initial flight in December 1974. It was a sleek-looking aircraft with a long fuselage and swing wing and was powered by four turbofan engines mounted in two nacelles directly under the wing root. The bomber reached a top speed of Mach 2.2 at altitude and Mach .85 at low level and could carry 277  STRATEGIC BOMBARDMENT INTO THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY CHAPTER 11 278 deployed the Hound Dog and
