ified success. The B-1B saw its first combat in Operation Desert Fox against the Iraqis in December 1998, delivering sixty-three tons of 500-pound bombs. Stealth One of the key military aviation innovations that has emerged in the past few decades is stealth technology. Along with precision- guided munitions, stealth has altered air war- fare, symbolizes the air power of the future, and dramatically demonstrates American military and technological dominance. Initially the defender had only two means of detecting aircraft, visual and acoustic, both limited in a number of ways. Thus the defender's problem appeared insoluble, as he would have great difficulty detecting and responding to a fast moving enemy attack before it did its deadly work. This reality led in the 1920s and 1930s to the belief that "the bomber will always get through."The answer to this problem was radar that gave the defender the ability to detect enemy aircraft at a distance, day or night in fair weather or foul, aim antiaircraft artillery, and guide fighter interceptors. Radar was the centerpiece of air defense systems that defeated the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Brit- ain and later allowed the Germans to mount a stout defense against Allied bombers. Early on engineers knew what caused large radar returns and how these returns could be increased or decreased. The ability to enhance the radar image could be used for offensive purposes as exploited in decoy missiles. The attempt to decrease the aircraft's radar return received much less attention as it faced two major obstacles. First, the engineers did not adequately understand the 281 physical interactions between radar and air- craft and lacked analytical tools (test ranges, high-speed computers, and computer mod- els) to study and test stealth. Second, making an aircraft less detectable to radar made it less flyable as the standard aircraft configura- tion, the right angles and vertical surfaces, antennas, inlets, canopies, and external stores
