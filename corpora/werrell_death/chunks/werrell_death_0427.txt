it degraded engine and aircraft performance. The USAF attempted at least four different schemes to reduce the U-2's RCS, but none resulted in major RCS reduction, although most adversely affected aircraft performance. This reinforced the view that once an aircraft's configuration was set, little could be done to significantly reduce RCS. Lockheed's Mach During this period the military and industry made numerous efforts to reduce the RCS of unmanned aerial vehicles. Lockheed's D-21 made generous use of RAM throughout its structure and had the lowest RCS of any Lockheed aircraft built to this point. Teledyne engineers mounted a wire mesh screen over the engine inlet, used RAM blankets, and later employed built- in RAM on the Ryan BQM-34 drone. Reportedly in a 1962 test it did not appear on the radar screen of the Air Force's best interceptor of the day, the F-106, and that aircraft's radar-guided Falcon air-to-air mis- sile could not guide on the drone. The Air Force also retrofitted its Hound Dog, air- to-surface missile, with RAM that notably reduced head-on RCS. In the summer of 1974 the USAF went one step further, initiating a program to study and demonstrate a low observable aircraft. Lockheed fought its way into the project and came up with a solution from an unlikely direction that yielded a satisfac- tory answer. Two Lockheed mathematicians  MIUS 282 CHAPTER 11 STRATEGIC BOMBARDMENT INTO THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 283 goals were an RCS similar to Have Blue, a five-thousand-pound bomb load (nominally two 2,000-pound bombs), a mission radius of four hundred nautical miles, and a maxi- mum speed of Mach .9. concluded that RCS could be reduced by using a series of properly oriented flat plates, what came to be called "faceting." More convincingly, in five weeks they wrote a computer program that could evaluate the radar returns of the various designs. Resis- tance to the concept within Lockheed dis- sipated after RCS tests of models indicated that the computer prog
