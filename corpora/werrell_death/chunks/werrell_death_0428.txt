ote a computer program that could evaluate the radar returns of the various designs. Resis- tance to the concept within Lockheed dis- sipated after RCS tests of models indicated that the computer program had accurately assessed the design's RCS characteristics and its amazingly low RCS.4 The F-117 looks like Have Blue but is about twice its size and three times its weight, or about the size of an F-15 fighter.6 Besides the increase in size, the most notice- able difference between the two was the change from an inward to an outward- canted tail fin. Lockheed added a rotating The government ran a competition for a flying stealth demonstrator (XST) between Lockheed and Northrop to be decided by an RCS test of full-scale models. The gov- ernment announced Lockheed as the win- ner in April 1976 and began what became known as the Have Blue program. Lock- heed built two manned aircraft that proved to be both flyable and essentially undetect- able, although one Air Force estimated that its design reduced aerodynamic efficiency 20 to 30 percent. A new aviation technology (computer stabilized flight, "fly-by-wire") allowed this ungainly aircraft to fly. The Air Force had a new technology that promised to give it a significant advantage. Now it had to develop this jewel. receptacle for air-to-air refueling just behind the cockpit to give the aircraft greater range and mounted mesh grids over the engine intake and wire mesh screens over the two infrared (IR) weapons sensors to reduce RCS. As in the Have Blue aircraft, the F-117 used components designed for other aircraft to speed development and reduce cost and risk. Lockheed fitted the aircraft with two side-by-side bomb bays, each capable of carrying a 2,000-pound guided bomb. No radar was put aboard the aircraft; instead Lockheed borrowed IR sensors from the F-16 and mated them to laser designators. To diminish their RCS, they were mounted internally and protected from radar by wire mesh. The aperture proved a considerable
