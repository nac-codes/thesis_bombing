Ms introduced in Vietnam and now further developed, and stealth), a second major change was the USAF's new concept of strategic operations as conceived by a serv- ing Air Force officer, Col. John Warden. He was very critical of the graduated use of air power in Vietnam and instead advocated a short, powerful campaign to gain air superi- ority, "the first and most compelling task."13 Warden called for immediate and direct attacks on the enemy's "center of gravity" the point where he is most vulnerable. Con- trary to prior thinking Warden posited that partial destruction of targets might achieve the desired result, bombing for effect not for destruction. This coupled with PGMs indicated that considerably less effort would be required than in the past. In a 1988 Air Staff paper Warden illustrated his ideas of targeting priorities with five concentric rings arranged as an archery target, with leadership at the center, production next, then a nation's infrastructure, the morale of the population, and in the outermost ring, fielded military forces. As a planner at the Pentagon, Warden was a major force devis- ing the air plan in the Gulf War.14 The F-117s helped open the attack by dropping laser-guided bombs on one-third of the strategic targets on the first night of the war and, despite poor weather, hitting three-fifths of them. Within minutes coali- tion airmen shattered Iraqi's extensive air defense system and obtained complete con- trol of the air. During the course of the war the F-117s demonstrated the effectiveness of stealth as they suffered neither loss nor damage, the only combat aircraft engaged in the campaign able to make that claim. The Nighthawk also demonstrated the improve- ment in bombing accuracy as its bombs hit an average of forty-three feet from the target and on thirteen hundred sorties scored sev- enteen hundred direct hits. Cruise missiles saw action for the first time in this war. The Navy launched 280 Tomahawks from a variety of platforms, and
