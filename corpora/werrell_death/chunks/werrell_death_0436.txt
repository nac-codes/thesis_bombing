n the 1991 Gulf War was their employment of the Scud missile. Although a short range and inaccurate missile, it represented a significant political and military threat as it was feared that it might be armed with chemical or nuclear warheads. The Iraqis launched eighty-eight Scuds that killed fifty-three and accounted for one-fifth of U.S. combat deaths. (U.S. Naval Institute Photo Archive) 2 German V-2 of World War II. In all the Iraqis launched eighty-eight against Saudi Arabia and Israel, killing twenty-eight Americans (one-fifth of U.S. fatalities), thirteen Israelis, and twelve Saudis. The coalition airmen devoted only .4 percent of their total strikes to leadership targets. These attacks made Iraqi com- mand and control more difficult, but did little more because of the coalition's limited intelligence, inadequate munitions, Iraqi countermeasures, and tough bunkers. The bombing of one of these command bunkers at Al Firdos did force a policy change. One F-117 squarely hit the facility, killed a number of Iraqi security officials and staff as intended, but also killed some two hundred to four hundred civilians who, unbeknown to the targeteers, were also sheltered in the bunker. Shrill cries from both the Iraqis and international press played up the incident as a gross, intentional American attack, typical of the bombing campaign. As a result the American commander in the theater took control over targeting against Baghdad and essentially shut down further attacks. Mean- while the USAF quickly developed a new 4,600-pound, penetrating ("bunker buster") guided bomb (GBU-28) to destroy these buried command bunkers and used it suc- cessfully only hours before the war's end. There were other limited efforts against strategic targets. Although only .8 percent were aimed at electricity, this effort shut down the country's power grid and reduced Iraqi's power production to 15 percent of its prewar capacity. Another 1.3 percent took out 90 percent of Iraqi's oil-refining
