electricity, this effort shut down the country's power grid and reduced Iraqi's power production to 15 percent of its prewar capacity. Another 1.3 percent took out 90 percent of Iraqi's oil-refining capabil- ity, a strange target as it could have no effect in the short campaign and was counter to the aim of minimizing damage that would complicate Iraq's postwar recovery. Bio- logical facilities were also hit, but postwar inspection found no production facilities. The airmen did better against chemical To meet this challenge the coali- tion mustered quick countermeasures. The Americans lashed together a crude system using satellites that provided a few minutes warning to both the military and civilians thus helping minimize casualties. The Army deployed its Patriot SAM and reprogrammed it to defend against the bal- listic missile and announced great success, although this record was later questioned and remains one of the controversies of the war. The coalition airmen also flew some four thousand sorties against the Scuds, but their claims of eighty mobile launchers destroyed are disputed. In a similar fashion the Army's long-range missiles (Army tacti- cal missile system) and special forces also came up dry. Nevertheless the coalition's efforts did force the Iraqis to hurry their launches, which further reduced accuracy and did cut the Iraqis launch rate in half. These efforts coupled with the inaccuracy of the Scuds, the small number involved, technical problems, and light conventional warheads reduced their effect and inflicted few casualties. Thus the Scud campaign came down to its psychological impact on the civilians and political impact on their leaders. In the end the Scud's limitations coupled with the coalition's counterac- tions persuaded the Israelis to stay out of the fight. This counter-effort made up 3.5 percent of strikes. Air power claimed great success in this war while strategic operations were limited.  IUS 290 CHAPTER 11 STRATEGIC HE TWENTY-FIRS
