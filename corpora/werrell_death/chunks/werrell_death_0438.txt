out of the fight. This counter-effort made up 3.5 percent of strikes. Air power claimed great success in this war while strategic operations were limited.  IUS 290 CHAPTER 11 STRATEGIC HE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY targets, destroying or heavily damaging three-quarters of these. Once again intelligence was a major problem. For example, one source states that fifty of eight hundred strategic targets were misidentified. The attacks on nuclear facilities highlighted the severe intelligence problems. At the start of the war, intelli- gence identified two nuclear targets, by the war's end it found eight, and postwar UN inspection found twenty-one facilities. This striking intelligence failure undoubtedly had an impact on the later, and much more consequential, intelligence failure regarding Iraqi nuclear programs in 2003. The wartime intelligence that indicated great success against the NBC targets contrasted with the USAF's postwar inspection (The Gulf War Air Power Survey), which concluded that this bombing only "inconvenienced" the Iraqis. Approximately 2.3 percent of the air strikes were aimed at the NBC targets. war obscures the failures and shortfalls of the strategic air war. As had been the case in the Vietnam War, the bulk of the strategic strikes were flown by fighter type aircraft, while the B-52, the symbol of strategic bombardment for decades, primarily hit ground support tar- gets in Kuwait.16 Aerial refueling unleashed the smaller aircraft from the constraints of range, while PGMs meant that small bomb deliveries could have the same impact as the massive bombings of previous air campaigns with much less fear of collateral damage. One discouraging note, despite the new technologies, was that weather continued to be a problem for the attackers. In all the airmen directed 11 percent of their strike sorties and 17 percent of their PGMs against strategic targets. In contrast to the overwhelming and unqualified suc- cess of the tactical bombing, these strategic attac
