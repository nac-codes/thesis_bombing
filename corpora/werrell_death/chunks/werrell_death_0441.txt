apparently there were problems with the offensive avionics, elec- trical, and escape systems. The RCS tests presented the greatest difficulties, however; the decision makers decided that with the breakup of the Soviet Union the RCS requirements could be relaxed and that fixes could be retrofitted into the bomber. The results are amazing for an aircraft so large, as its RCS is a fraction of that of the B-52 and B-1B. High costs also result from the small buy. The implosion of the Soviet Union and escalating costs led the George H. W. Bush administration to lower the B-2 purchase to seventy-five and then in January 1992 to twenty-one, including the six test air- craft. The public and Congress expected a peace dividend, the incoming Democratic administration in 1993 wanted to cut costs, and the Air Force had other uses for the money. The demise of SAC and questions about the need for long-range, penetrating bombers with no superpower rival were other factors in this decision. The bomber took a long time to mature, only becoming operational in April 1997. As the total cost for the program was around $45 billion, each bomber cost $2.1 billion, an astonish- ing figure equal to the cost of a capital ship. This may explain why the majority of B-2s power the bomber that is manned by two pilots. The B-2 features two bomb bays, each of which can carry up to ten tons of bombs. The bomber was initially intended for high-altitude flight, but before metal was cut, the Air Force added a low-level requirement that necessitated a redesign that cost an additional year and $1 billion. It first flew in July 1989. The bomber, known as the advanced technology bomber (ATB), began develop- ment in a super-secret "black" program. Northrop had lost out to Lockheed in the 1970s competition for the stealth demon- strator (XST, Have Blue) but continued to work with stealth, getting a contract for a battlefield surveillance aircraft (BSAX, Tacit Blue). Unlike the F-117, which was designed mainly
