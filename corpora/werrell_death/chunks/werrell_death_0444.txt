There was no military need for such assets, the use of heavy bombers might send the wrong diplomatic signals, and for politi- cal reasons the Italians would not allow the F-117s to use their air bases. Action in the Balkans continued as a consequence of Serb abuse of Muslims in the former Yugoslav province of Kosovo. In March 1999 two B-2s helped open an air campaign (Operation Allied Force) against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, flying a thirty-one-hour mission that delivered thirty-two 2,000-pound GPS-guided JDAMs on their first combat mission. B-2 bombers dropped some 650 during the Kosovo campaign; 90 percent hit within  294 CHAPTER 11 STRATEGIC BOMBARDMENT INTO THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 295 LIBRARIES choice of targets, specifically their attacks on oil facilities, the Serbian television headquarters, and bridges over the Danube.

No ground soldiers were commit- ted, although some special forces may have been involved; clearly air power dominated this conflict.

Although the Serbs had a weaker air defense than the Iraqis, they adopted a more successful, albeit losing, strategy. They did not attempt to contest the Allied air forces and remained a force in being throughout the campaign, complicating the air offensive. Casual- ties were low, an F-117 and F-16 downed, although both pilots were rescued, and two American helicopter pilots killed when they crashed attempting to evade a SAM.
