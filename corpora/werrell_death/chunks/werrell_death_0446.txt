Chinese embassy, killing three. The Chinese, and others, did not believe the embarrassed American explanation that an outdated map led to this bombing. Despite these glaring and much publicized incidents, almost all of the bombs hit their assigned targets, only twenty of twenty-three thousand noted as having gone "astray."There was criticism of the slow, graduated air campaign that was hindered by political considerations. There were also criticisms of NATO's defense and no combat losses, although one B-1B went down to noncombat causes. As in all war there were a number of instances of collateral damage and friendly fire losses. Air power played a similar role in the March 2003 campaign (Iraqi Freedom) that overthrew the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein. An attack by cruise missiles and F-117s on the Iraqi dictator preceded the main action but failed to hit him. Again U.S. strategic bombers were important, although attacking few strategic targets. B-52s for the first time employed laser-guided bombs and 32 overall two-thirds of the thirty thousand bombs dropped in the campaign were guided bombs. Ballistic missile defense got little notice but did better than in the 1991 Gulf War, in this case improved Patriot missiles downing all nine ballistic missiles launched by the Iraqis. Baghdad was taken in twenty days, ending the conventional phase of the war, which then devolved into a bloody and confused conflict consisting of guerrilla warfare, terrorist attacks, and civil war ... warfare unsuited for strategic air operations.  LIBRARIES CONCLUSION 32 A ir power has come a long way in the century since the Wright Brothers' first flight. That event changed both civilization and warfare as the frail wood and canvas machines evolved into vehicles enabling mass and speedy movement as well as delivery of death and destruction. Follow- ing World War I theorists forecast that the airplane would be decisive in future wars by bombing enemy cities and industries and at the same
