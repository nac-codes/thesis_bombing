as governments and populations have become much more sensitive to the use of military force and especially to civilian casualties. Since World War II a number of factors have altered strategic bombing. First, tech- nology has changed. The balance between offensive and defense has shifted with the introduction of potent surface-to-air mis- siles that force strategic bombers to fly low, degrading their performance. While stealth technology seemed to finesse this problem, it is expensive. Another change has been the growing intrusion of smaller (tactical) aircraft into the strategic bombardment role as fighter/attack aircraft increased their capa- bilities to rival large, long-range bombers. Air-to-air refueling allowed smaller aircraft to overcome most of the restrictions of range. In a similar fashion precision-guided munitions reduced the effort once required to destroy a target from hundreds of tons of "dumb" bombs to the present time, when several targets can be destroyed by a single aircraft delivering a few "smart" bombs. As a result smaller fighter/attack aircraft now can fulfill most of the missions of a strategic bomber cheaper and with less vulnerability. The traditional view of strategic bombard- ment, of formations of large, slow aircraft carrying massive bomb loads on penetrating missions is obsolete. to-surface missiles have seen little combat and when used have lacked adequate accuracy, numbers, and destructive power to significantly influence the course of these conflicts. Practical concerns undercut such employment. Less expensive weapons can do the job and incoming ballistic missiles launched by a nuclear power could be mis- taken for a nuclear attack and might trigger an excessive response. Conventional warfare against a power with weak air defenses is another matter. In this case long-range and large bomb loads coupled with expectations of low losses may well recommend the use of manned bombers. Ballistic and cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehic
