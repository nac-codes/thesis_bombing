another matter. In this case long-range and large bomb loads coupled with expectations of low losses may well recommend the use of manned bombers. Ballistic and cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, stealthy attack aircraft armed with PGMs, along with modern air defenses make the manned penetrating bomber impractical in conflicts between nations possessing major air power. For nuclear operations, ballistic missiles, both land and sea based, have emerged as a far quicker, less vulnerable, and cheaper nuclear delivery and deterrent systems than manned bombers. Conventionally armed ballistic missiles are another matter. Thus far nonnuclear surface- Another factor is the change in public attitudes concerning bombardment of cities and civilians. The large casualties and mas- sive destruction of European and Japanese cities during World War II and the threat of nuclear devastation sobered and terrorized people around the world. Attitudes changed to the extent that in Vietnam there was extraordinary concern about civilian casual- ties (affecting targeting because of concern over collateral damage). Today the Internet, ubiquitous camera phones, and twenty-four- hour news coverage leave no bomb blast uncovered. World War II strategic bombing is no longer acceptable, even in a worthy cause. Since World War II the world has entered a period of limited wars. Thus far the countries that have fought these wars either had limited capabilities and targets or, in the conflicts that pitted major powers against minor powers, a lack of targets or political pressures that inhibited strategic bombardment. The use of strategic bombing by major powers against minor ones has yielded meager, mixed, and sometimes even During the four decades of the Cold War the world was haunted by the specter of a nuclear exchange that did not occur. At first long-range strategic bombers were the only nuclear delivery system, then  300 CONCLUSION ( LIBRARIES 432 SOURCE NOTES Command in the late 1950s a
