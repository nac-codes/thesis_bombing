re excessively covered by the secondary sources. For British bombers throughout this study I have used Peter Lewis, The British Bomber since 1914 (London: Putnam, 1967), along with Owen Thetford, Aircraft of the Royal Air Force since 1918 (London: Putnam, 1968). Overall studies on U.S. bombers of especial value are Lloyd Jones, U.S. Bombers: B1-B70 (Los Angeles:Aero, 1962); Gordon Swanborough and Peter Bowers, United States Military Aircraft since 1908 (London: Putnam, 1971); and Ray Wagner, American Combat Planes (Garden City, N.Y .: Doubleday, 1982). Though 301  Us SOURCE NOTES 302 SOURCE NOTES 303 ITY LIBRARIES rough reading, the essential work for the later period is Marcelle Knaack's Encyclopedia of U.S. Air Force Aircraft and Missile Systems, vol. 2, Post-World War II Bombers (Washington, D.C .: Office of Air Force His- tory, 1988). German bombers are magnificently covered in William Green's Warplanes of the Third Reich (Garden City, N.Y .: Doubleday, 1979). For World War II bombers William Green's two volumes, Famous Bombers of the Second World War (Garden City, N.Y .: Hanover House, 1959 and 1960), have well stood the test of time. The best book on the first battle of Britain remains Raymond Fredette, The Sky on Fire (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1966), although Thomas Fegan's more recent book, The "Baby Killers" (London: Cooper, 2002), was also helpful. For details of the zeppelin campaign I have relied primarily on Douglas Robinson's wonderful The Zeppelin in Combat (Sun Valley, Calif .: Caler, 1971), and a useful narrative account by Ernest Dudley, Monsters of the Purple Twilight (London, Harrap, 1960). Clearly the best on the German R-planes is G. W. Haddow and Peter Grosz, The German Giants (London: Putnam, 1962). On British strategic bombing see George Williams's Biplanes and Bombsights (Maxwell AFB, Ala .: Air University, 1999), an update of his 1987 Ph.D. dissertation. 1. These craft had a rigid framework, an outer skin, and gas bags within
