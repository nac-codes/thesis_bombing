eorge Williams's Biplanes and Bombsights (Maxwell AFB, Ala .: Air University, 1999), an update of his 1987 Ph.D. dissertation. 1. These craft had a rigid framework, an outer skin, and gas bags within providing lift. In addi- tion to the Zeppelin company, three other companies built airships for the German military. For simplicity's sake I have used the less accurate but less confusing term "zeppelin" (lower case) to describe all German rigid airships, and capitalized "Zeppelin" when referring to the man and the company. 2. Dead reckoning uses direction flown (course) along with speed and time elapsed to determine position. The difficult variable is the wind, which will affect both speed and course. 3. Only four of the eighty-one German naval airships achieved higher speeds in their trials. 4. Fegan, "Baby Killers," 12. 5. In 1917 the Germans experimented with a double-walled gas bag, the outer containing an inert gas, but the weight penalty led to its abandonment. 6. Only four large Zeppelins were built during the war. 7. Robinson, Zeppelin in Combat, 202, 197-202. 8. When glycerin did not solve the freezing problem, sand was substituted for ballast. In April 1917 the gun decision was modified to carrying two on overwater scouting missions. 9. Thus far the earlier model Gothas had been used to support the German army. The Germans used a prefix to indicate the function of the aircraft, "C" for observation, "D" for fighters, "G" for bombers, and "R" for large bombers. 10. Haddow and Grosz, German Giants, 26. 11. The Germans killed 260 Parisians with forty-five tons of artillery shells from the infamous "Big Berthas," which also caused $10 million of damage. 12. Williams, Biplanes and Bombsights, 5, 7-8. 13.

A plan from the field written in May 1918 called for attacks on industrial targets, with pride of place to iron and coal, then chemicals, followed by explosives, and finally miscellaneous production. 15.
