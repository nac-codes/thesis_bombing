A number of chapters in the official German history of the war, Research Institute for Military History, Germany and the Second World War, vols. 1, 2, 7 [thus far] (Oxford: Clarendon, 1990, 1991), are important. I found the dated Royal Air Force, The Rise and Fall of the German Air Force (1933-1945) (Old Greenwich, Conn .: WE, 1969), still useful. Also see James Corum, The Luftwaffe (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1997); E. R. Hooton, Phoenix Triumphant (New York: Arms and Armour, 1994); Richard Muller, The German Air War in Russia (Baltimore: Nauti- cal and Aviation, 1992); Williamson Murray, Strategy for Defeat: The Luftwaffe, 1933-1945 (Maxwell AFB, Ala .: Air University, 1983); and Hanfried Schliephake, The Birth of the Luftwaffe (Chicago: Regnery, 1971). On German bombers William Green asserts his authority in his extensive The Warplanes of the Third Reich (Garden City, N.Y .: Doubleday, 1970). For German doctrine I relied on Corum, Luftwaffe; and Richard Suchenwirth, "The Development of the German Air Force, 1919-1939," USAF Historical study
