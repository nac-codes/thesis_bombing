ird Reich (Garden City, N.Y .: Doubleday, 1970). For German doctrine I relied on Corum, Luftwaffe; and Richard Suchenwirth, "The Development of the German Air Force, 1919-1939," USAF Historical study no. 160, 1968, HRA. GAF combat operations are covered in Cajus Bekker, The Luftwaffe War Diaries (Gar- den City, N.Y .: Doubleday, 1968); and Lee Kennett, A History of Strategic Bombing: From the First Hot-air Balloons to Hiroshima and Nagasaki (New York: Scribner's, 1982). The literature on the Battle of Britain is immense. I found the old study by Derek Wood and Derek Dempster, The Narrow Margin (New York: McGraw Hill, 1961), most useful, along with the brief, more recent effort by Richard Overy, The Battle of Britain (New York: Norton, 2000). Also helpful were Richard Hough and Denis Richards, The Battle of Britain (New York: Norton, 1989); T. C. G.James, The Battle of Britain (London: Cass,2005);Jon Lake, The Battle of Britain (London: Silverdale, 2000); and Richard Overy, The Air War, 1939-1945 (New York: Stein and Day, 1980). The bombing of Coventry is the subject of Norman Longmate's Air Raid (New York: Mckay, 1976). On the He 177 see Green's Warplanes of the Third Reich; Manfred Griehl, Heinkel He 177, 277, 274 (London: Airlife, 1998); R. S. Hirsch and Uwe Feist, Heinkel 177 (Fallbrook, Calif .: Aero, 1967); and two works by Alfred Price, "He 177 Greif," International Air Power Review, vol. 11 (2004): 158-73, and Heinkel He 177 (London: Aircraft Profile, n.d.). German strategic air attacks are well covered in Oleg Hoeffding, â€œGer- man Air Attacks Against Industry and Railroads in Russia, 1941-1945," RAND Memo RM-2606-PR, 1970, Air University Library, Montgomery, Ala. (hereafter cited as AUL). Using archival and secondary materials I cover the V-1 in Archie to SAM (Maxwell AFB, Ala .: Air University, 2005), and The Evolution of the Cruise Missile (Maxwell AFB, Ala .: Air University, 1985). Four very useful secondary works on the V-1 are Adam Gruen, Preemptive Def
