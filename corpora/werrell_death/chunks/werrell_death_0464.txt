sh had a numerical advantage in single-engine fighters, and during 1940 they built 4,283 fighters compared with 1,870 manufactured by the Germans. One problem with these figures is the difference between aircraft on hand and aircraft serviceable. 9. In 1939 the British completed their chain of radar stations, which had a detection range of eighty to one hundred miles against high-flying aircraft, as compared with eight or so miles with sound detectors. 10.

Between September 7 and November 13, 1940, the Luftwaffe lost only 81 aircraft on twelve thousand night sorties, mostly to flak. British night defenses improved, with fighters downing 22 of 39 GAF aircraft destroyed in March 1941, 48 of 87 in April, and 96 of 128 in the first two weeks of May. 12. During the three-month battle (July 27 to October 26), losses of Hurricanes and Spitfires exceeded production in only four weeks with a fifth week of equilibrium. Perhaps of greater signifi- cance, at this point British fighter production was more than double that of the Germans. 13. The Germans did not employ drop tanks on Me 109s, although they had been used in Spain. The pilots considered them dangerous, and their construction out of plywood proved faulty. 14.

Also helping the attackers was that the British botched the jamming of German navigational aids. 16. Green, Warplanes of the Third Reich, 336. 17. Hirsch and Feist, Heinkel 177, n.p. 18. The Hs 293 was a winged bomb powered by an underslung rocket engine. The 1,600-pound weapon had a range of nine miles when released from an altitude of eighteen thousand feet. The unpowered FX 1400 could reach almost three miles if launched from twenty-four thousand feet. The weapon's most famous exploit was the September 1943 sinking of the Italian battleship Roma after bein
