e unpowered FX 1400 could reach almost three miles if launched from twenty-four thousand feet. The weapon's most famous exploit was the September 1943 sinking of the Italian battleship Roma after being launched from Do 217s. 19. The Mistel mounted a manned fighter atop an unmanned bomber (Ju 88), which flew toward the target; the latter was detached and directed toward impact while the former returned to base. The piggyback concept was tested in 1942; however, the first operational use was not until June 1944 against shipping in the Normandy invasion. Plans in January 1945 for attacks against Soviet indus- trial targets were thwarted when the Russians overran GAF airfields; the only other combat opera- tions were in March against bridges on both the western and eastern front. 20.

From dead astern the V-1 presented a surface area of sixteen square feet, compared with forty-five square feet on the FW 190. 23. Gruen, Preemptive Defense, 14. 24. The CEP of the ground-launched V-1s in 1944 was eight miles; air-launchedV-1s, twenty- four miles; and the long-range V-1s in 1945, twelve miles. 25.

One source states that the failure rate on the ground and shortly after launch was 28 percent for the V-1 and 17 percent for the V-2. 27. British radar plots of eight-seven V-2 tracks indicated an average range of 184 miles, while a German source gives a range of 199 miles. 28. One source writes that twenty-seven thousand out of sixty-four thousand workers died at the facility, another states that one-third of sixty thousand died. 29. The British considered firing a barrage of antiaircraft guns into an air space upon radar warn- ing of a missile launch. H
