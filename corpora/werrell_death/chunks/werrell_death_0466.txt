British Strategic Bombing Data on British bombers are drawn primarily from Peter Lewis, The British Bomber since 1914 (London: Putnam, 1967); Owen Thetford, Aircraft of the Royal Air Force since 1918 (London: Putnam, 1968); and Wil- liam Green's two-volume Famous Bombers of the Second World War (Garden City, N.Y .: Doubleday, 1959; UK: Hanover House, 1960). On the Mosquito also see Edward Bishop, Mosquito: Wooden Wonder (New York: Ballantine, 1971), and Edward Shacklady, De Havilland Mosquito (Bristol, UK: Cerberus, 2003). The official account of Bomber Command is the four-volume history by Charles Webster and Noble Frankland, The Strategic Air Offensive Against Germany, 1939-1945 (London: HSMO, 1961) (hereafter cited as Webster and Frankland, SAOAG). This is supplemented by Report of the British Bombing Survey Unit (London: Cass, 1998); Sebastian Cox, ed., Dispatch of War Operations, 23 February 1942 to 8 May 1945, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur T.
