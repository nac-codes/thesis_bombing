44 and 1,283 in February 1945. Lancasters comprised 46 percent of the heavy bomber force in February 1943 and 73 percent in March 1945. 8. The name came from the observation that the equipment sounded like an oboe. 9. The origin of the designation is murky and variously said to be related either to "stinky," H2S being the chemical formula of hydrogen sulfite, which is an odorous combination, or "home sweet home." 10. Cox, Dispatch of War Operations, 11, 10. 11. A brief note on AAF and RAF organization during World War II. Both air forces used squad- rons consisting of one to two dozen aircraft as their lowest organizational unit, but while the British counted their forces in number of squadrons and organized these squadrons into groups consisting of a number of squadrons, the Americans organized four bomb squadrons (three in the case of the B-29s) into bomb groups and counted and thought in terms of groups. The AAF organized num- bers of bomb groups into bomb wings and bomb wings into bomber commands. 12. Webster and Frankland, SAOAG, 1:433. The authors cite as evidence that Bomber Command's most famous unit, in which three of the greatest bomber pilots flew, was 617 Squadron of 5 Group. The Pathfinders were formed with one squadron from each group of Bomber Command, each flying a different type aircraft. 13. One can only speculate what impact the deletion of the copilot had on accidents and survival rates in combat. 14. While the .303s had a higher rate of fire (1,150 shots per minute versus 800), the .50s had a higher muzzle velocity (2,990 feet per second versus 2,660) and a heavier projectile (thus greater impact) as well as a longer range. 15. Green, Famous Bombers of the Second World War, 1:124. 16. To be clear the loss rates for Bomber Command are of aircraft that failed to return or those listed as missing compared with the number of bombers dispatched. It does not include other losses, such as accidents over friendly territory or those bombers that returned
