t failed to return or those listed as missing compared with the number of bombers dispatched. It does not include other losses, such as accidents over friendly territory or those bombers that returned damaged and were written off as uneconomical to repair. Using the dispatched numbers obscures the fact that the bombers that actually bombed were fewer due to losses, to aborts, and to some aircraft bombing other than the designated target. The loss rate on a sortie basis was 2.36 percent for the Lancaster, 2.52 percent for the Halifax, and 3.71 percent for the Stirling. 17. The survival rate of crewmembers shot down was poorer in the Lancaster than in other Bomber Command aircraft, 11 percent in Lancasters compared with 29 percent in later model Halifaxes. 18. De Havilland claimed that wood construction required only 37 percent of the man hours compared to all-metal construction. 19. Webster and Frankland, SAOAG, 1:394. 20. Ibid., 2:168. 21.

In addition seventy-seven bombers were damaged, twelve of which were written off. 28. Middlebrook, Berlin Raids, 234; Webster and Frankland, SAOAG, 2:201-2. 29. Prior to September 1942 GAF pilots received more flying training hours than British pilots, but after that date German flying training hours declined while Allied flying hours increased. During the period October 1942 to June 1943, the average GAF pilot was receiving about 200 flying hours, the RAF pilot about 340, and the AAF pilot about 275, a gap that widened as the war progressed. 30.
