about 275, a gap that widened as the war progressed. 30. Webster and Frankland, SAOAG, 3:57. 31. Ibid., 3:112, 117. Chapter 5. U.S. Strategic Bombing in Europe The literature on the U.S. strategic air war against Germany is immense. This is demonstrated by two bibliographies, one by this author, Eighth Air Force Bibliography: An Extended Essay and Listing of Published and Unpublished Materials, Updated and Revised (Strasburg, Pa .: 8th Air Force Memorial Museum Founda- tion, 1996), and another following a tight, valuable article by Stephen McFarland and Wesley Newton, "The American Strategic Air Offensive Against Germany in World War II," in Case Studies in Strategic Bombardment, ed. Cargill Hall (Washington, D.C .: Air Force History and Museum Program, 1998). Materials on the B-17 and B-24 are indicated in chapter 1, along with William Green, Famous Bombers of the Second World War, vol. 1 (Garden City, N.Y .: Hanover House, 1959). My work on the Eighth Air Force, based on primary sources, can be found in "The Tactical Development of the Eighth Air Force in World War II," Ph.D. diss., Duke University, 1969, and on the Fifteenth Air Force in the 301st Bomb Group history, "Who Fears?": The 301st in War and Peace (Dallas: Turner, 1991). The official AAF history is the seven-volume, detailed, solid, and dated work by Frank Craven and James Cate, eds., The Army Air Forces in World War II (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1948-58) (hereafter cited as Craven and Cate, AAFWWII). Roger Freeman's trilogy on the Eighth is basic to any study of the subject: The Mighty Eighth (London: MacDonald, 1970), Mighty Eighth War Diary (London: Jane's, 1981), and Mighty Eighth War Manual (London: Jane's, 1984). On the British and German air forces, see the previous chapters. The best on GAF fighter defenses is the scholarly and excellent Donald Caldwell and Richard Muller, The Luftwaffe over Germany: Defense of the Reich (London: Greenhill Books, 2007).
