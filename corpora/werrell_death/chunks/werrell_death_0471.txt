ighter defenses is the scholarly and excellent Donald Caldwell and Richard Muller, The Luftwaffe over Germany: Defense of the Reich (London: Greenhill Books, 2007). Two key books are Stephen McFarland and Wesley Newton, To Command the Sky: The Battle for Air Superiority over Germany, 1942-1944 (Washington, D.C .: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1991), and the very detailed work by Richard Davis, Bombing the European Axis Powers (Maxwell AFB, Ala .: Air University, 2006).  Malus SOURCE NOTES 310 SOURCE NOTES 311 VERSITY LIBRARIES Statistical information is drawn mainly from two wartime studies: 8AF, Statistical Summary of Eighth Air Force Operations, European Theater: 17 Aug. 1942-8 May 1945, 520.308A, HRA; and 15AF, The Statistical Story of the Fifteenth Air Force, 670.308D, HRA. Another very useful document is 8AF, Eighth Air Force Tactical Development: Aug. 1942-May 1945, 520.04-1, HRA. Ploesti is well covered by James Dugan and Carroll Stewart, Ploesti (New York: Bantam, 1962), and Leon Wolff, Low Level Mission (New York: Berkley, 1957), but superseded by Michael Hill, Black Sunday (Atglen, Pa .: Schiffer, 1993). For the Schweinfurt raids see Thomas Coffey, Decision over Schweinfurt (New York: Mckay, 1977); Edward Jablonski, Double Strike (Garden City, N.Y .: Doubleday, 1974); and Martin Middlebrook, The Schweinfurt-Regensburg Mission (New York: Scribner's, 1983). On conclusions see my article "The Strate- gic Bombing of Germany in World War II: Costs and Accomplishments," Journal of American History, Dec. 1986, 702-13. I have relied on the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) reports, especially USSBS, Overall Report (European War), Sept. 1945, Air University Library, Montgomery, Ala. (hereafter cited as AUL). On the USSBS, see David MacIssac, Strategic Bombing in World War Two: The Story of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (New York: Garland, 1976), and the broader, critical, and more recent Gian Gentile, How Effective Is Strategic Bombing?
