This transfer indicates the importance the AAF put on escort fighters 24. For all of the Mustang's stellar attributes, it was relatively fragile, as its underslung radiator for its liquid-cooled engine was very vulnerable and a pilot could pull the wings off in a dive. 25. The Eighth lost a number of its leading aerial aces in strafing attacks, including the top AAF ace in Europe, Francis Gabre
