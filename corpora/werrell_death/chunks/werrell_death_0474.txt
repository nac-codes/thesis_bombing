gine was very vulnerable and a pilot could pull the wings off in a dive. 25. The Eighth lost a number of its leading aerial aces in strafing attacks, including the top AAF ace in Europe, Francis Gabreski (twenty-eight victories). 26. Craven and Cate, AAFWWII, 3:8. 27.

The top German ace of the war had 352 credits, compared with the top American ace in the European theater, who had 28. Approximately 107 Germans scored more than 100 victories. 29. The RAF got 15 percent of its bombs on target during its January 1945 raid. 30. On average 16 percent of the bombs inside the target area were duds. Two-fifths of the iden- tified duds were American and three-fifths were British. The Germans are still dealing with these unexploded bombs. 31. Davis, Bombing the European Axis Powers, 507. 32. There are few direct comparisons. One study of attacks on three oil plants reveals that the Eighth got 27 percent hits using visual techniques (20 percent of the tonnage), 12 percent with part visual and part instrument (22 percent of the tonnage), and 5 percent with full instruments (58 per- cent of the tonnage), which yields an overall average of 11 percent hits compared with Bomber Command, which got 16 percent hits. This effort accounted for about one-third of the Eighth's effort against oil refineries and one-tenth of Bomber Command's. 33. Flak downed as many as half the Eighth's heavy bombers and three-quarters of its fighters. 34. USSBS, Overall Report (Europe), 107. 35. At the beginning of the war the German army employed six hundred thousand horses; at the end it used double that number. 36. Bomber Command cost the British about 7 percent of their war effort,
