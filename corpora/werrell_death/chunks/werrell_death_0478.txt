ngton, D.C .: Air Force History and Museums Program, 1996). The Air Force-Navy fight (and much more) is well presented in the congressional hearings and in Jeffrey Barlow, Revolt of the Admirals: The Fight for Naval Aviation, 1945-1950 (Washington, D.C .: Naval Historical Center, 1994). Strategic Air Command annual histories have been largely declassified and are available at the Air Force Historical Research Agency and National Archives. A number of SAC monographs are valuable, such as Edward Longacre, The Formative Years, 1944-1949 (Offutt AFB, Neb .: SAC, n.d.); and SAC, Seventy Years of Strategic Air Refueling, 1918-1988: A Chronology (Offutt AFB, Neb .: SAC, 1990). The best on aerial refueling is the outstanding study by Richard Smith, 75 Years of Inflight Refueling: Highlights, 1923-1998 (Washington, D.C .: Air Force History and Museums Program, 1998). Other useful studies on SAC are Norman Polmar and Timothy Laur, eds., Strategic Air Command: People, Aircraft, and Missiles, 2nd ed. (Annapolis, Md .: Nautical and Aviation, 1990); and Alwyn Lloyd, A Cold War Legacy: A Tribute to Strategic Air Command, 1946-1992 (Missoula, Mont .: Pictorial, 1999). The basic source on the USAF in the Korean War remains the dated but excellent official history authored by Robert Futrell, The United States Air Force in Korea, 1950-1953 (New York: Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1961). The basis for this study is his more detailed and formerly classified historical studies. A much briefer but well done contribution is USAF, Steadfast and Courageous: FEAF Bomber Command and the Air War in Korea, 1950-1953 (Washington, D.C .: Air Force History and Museums Program, 2000). Other recent books deal with most of the other aspects of the air war with understandable lesser coverage of strategic bombing, with the notable exception of Conrad Crane's valuable American Airpower Strategy in Korea, 1950-1953 (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2000).
