tested but not procured is AMC, "Historical Data on Aircraft Developed but not Produced, 1945-Present," c. Mar 1957, K201-106, HRA. There are  Us NOC 316 SOURCE NOTES SOURCE NOTES many books on Jack Northrop's flying wings, all covering essentially the same ground. Less accessible but more scholarly is Francis Baker, "The Death of the Flying Wing," Ph.D. diss., Claremont, 1984. The underappreciated B-47 is covered magnificently in Alwyn Lloyd's Boeing's B-47 Stratojet (North Branch, Minn .: Specialty, 2005). The B-52 is the subject of numerous books and articles, two of the bet- ter books of which are Walter Boyne's still excellent Boeing B-52: A Documentary History (London: Jane's, 1981), and the more recent Martin Bowman, Stratofortress: The Story of the B-52 (n.p .: Pen & Sword, 2005). From the USAF's point of view see the very well done work by Lori Tagg, Development of the B-52: The Wright Field Story (Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio: Aeronautical Systems Center History Office, 2004). Richard Smith's Seventy-Five Years of Inflight Refueling: Highlights, 1923-1998 (Washington, D.C .: Air Force History and Museums Program, 1998) is very good on that subject and the KC-135.The B-58 gets its due in the very detailed study by Jay Miller, Convair B-58 Hustler: The World's First Supersonic Bomber (Leicester, UK: Aerofax, 1987), and the more accessible article by Bill Yenne, "B-58 Hustler: Con- vair's Ultimate Delta," International Air Power Review 2 (2001): 116-49. Especially useful on the B-70 are U.S. Congress, Senate, The B-70 Program, Report of the Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee of the Committee on Armed Services, 1960; Tim Curry et al., "North American XB-70 Valkyrie Interconti- nental Strategic Bomber," Aerospace Engineering Department, California State Polytechnic University, June 1994; John Sotham, "The Legend of the Valkyrie," Air and Space, Aug./Sept. 1999. The Navy's attack seaplane program is well told in William Trimble's Attack from the Sea: A Histor
