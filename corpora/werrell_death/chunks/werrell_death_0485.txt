The B-45 had the range and bomb-load capabilities of a World War II heavy bomber. 4.

On the ground the wing tip drooped sixteen inches down from the horizontal, and in flight it flexed forty-five inches above the horizontal. In static tests the wing tips were deflected a total of 17.5 feet. This gave a more comfortable ride, although observers were somewhat startled by the sight. 6. The crews might have been uneasy, but the B-47B registered only one fatal accident (with three deaths) without ejection seats through the end of 1955 on forty-nine major accidents, twelve of which were fatal. 7. These consisted of two rows of small, perpendicular airfoils mounted along the top span of the wing that improved the characteristics of the air flow. 317 8. The seats had dependability problems as late as 1952; there were four seat failures in ten attempted ejections in forty-two fatal B-47/RB-47 accidents through 1955. 9. In July 1960 the Soviets downed one off the coast of Russia, killing four of the crew and imprisoning the other two, who were later released. Another B-47 was shot up by the North Koreans in April 1965, but it landed safely without casualties. 10. Earl Peck,"B-47 Stratojet," in Flying Combat Aircraft of the USAAF-USAF, ed.

Over their lifetimes the B-45, B-57, and B-58 had higher major accident rates and the B-52, FB-111, and B-1 had lower rates than the B-47. 13. The P6M-2's wing span was 100 feet and its length was 134 feet. The Sea Master was also considered for photo reconnaissance and air-refueling roles. 14.
