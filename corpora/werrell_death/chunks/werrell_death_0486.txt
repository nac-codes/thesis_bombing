's wing span was 100 feet and its length was 134 feet. The Sea Master was also considered for photo reconnaissance and air-refueling roles. 14.

The testers noted that stall warning was indefinite and the stall "so violent that the YB-60 airplane should not be intentionally stalled at any time". Ibid., 26. 15.

The USAF was concerned about battle damage to the fuel tanks because an analysis of World War II bomber losses indicated that 80 percent were directly caused by fire, usually from the fuel systems. Initially the airmen wanted 70 percent of the B-52's fuel cells to be self-sealing, but they reconsidered because of the cost in money and weight. The Air Force compromised with tear-proof fuel cells, which would resist direct hit causing a tank to burst but not contain fuel leaks. 18. The forward gear already had the ability to pivot for ground movement, and the rear gear was now fitted with the same capability. 19. The USAF looked at installing Falcon air-to-air missiles, suggested by Hughes in August 1951, which would add two and a half tons in weight and considerable expense ($1.5 billion). In view of the Falcon's miserable combat record in Vietnam, this was not a good idea. 20. Knaack, Post-World War II Bombers, 230. 21. SAC launched five B-52s, three slated to complete the flight and two spares (one aborted with an iced-up refueling receptacle, the other landed as planned). The Command spotted 78 KC-97s to get the B-52s to their record, with additional tankers on alert at four bases as a backup. One human interest note: Lt. Col. James Morris, aircraft commander of the lead ship, had been the copilot on the Lucky Lady II on its record-breaking flight. 22. Five B-52s were lost between June 1959 and February 1964 to severe turbulence. Gus
