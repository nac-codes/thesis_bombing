35. In one of the ironies of history, after the cancellation of the TSR.2 the RAF adopted the Buccaneer in 1969. 36. One unusual feature was that the crew entered the aircraft by getting into their ejection seats on the ramp underneath the aircraft and were then hoisted, elevator fashion, into the aircraft. 37. While we do not have accident statistics on the Tu-22, more than seventy were lost prior to 1975, about 23 percent of production. It certainly had a higher accident rate than the docile Tu-16 and a higher one than its rival, the B-58, of which 22 of the 116 built were lost (19 percent). 38. The Tu-160 has a length of 178 feet and wingspan (fully extended) of 183 feet, and it weighs 258,000 pounds empty and 606,000 pounds at takeoff, compared with 146 feet and 137 feet, and 192,000 pounds and 477,000 pounds for the B-1B. The Tu-160 has a maximum speed of Mach 2.05 (versus the B-1B's Mach 1.2), and at sea level, 556 knots (versus 520 knots). Chapter 9. The 1960s and 1970s There are a number of excellent books on the bombing of North Vietnam, for example, Mark Clod- felter, The Limits of Air Power: The American Bombing of North Vietnam (New York: Free Press, 1989), and Earl Tilford, Crosswinds: The Air Force's Setup in Vietnam (College Station: Texas A&M, 1993). However, I found the most useful to be Wayne Thompson's more recent To Hanoi and Back: The U.S. Air Force and North Vietnam, 1966-1973 (Washington, D.C .: Smithsonian, 2000). An important study of Rolling Thunder that is particularly good on targets and intelligence is Paul Berg's "Assessing U.S. Air Force Bombing Effectiveness During Rolling Thunder," Ph.D. diss., Auburn University, 2001.A view from the Communist side that challenges U.S. claims is Dana Drenkowski and Lester Grau, "Patterns and Predict- ability: The Soviet Evaluation of Operation Linebacker II," Journal of Slavic Military Studies 20, no. 4 (Dec. 2007): 559-607. The SAC histories are quite detailed, although portions remain classified. F
