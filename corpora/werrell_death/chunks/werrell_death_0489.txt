lity: The Soviet Evaluation of Operation Linebacker II," Journal of Slavic Military Studies 20, no. 4 (Dec. 2007): 559-607. The SAC histories are quite detailed, although portions remain classified. For a critical and excellent view of the B-52 operations, see Marshall Michel, The Eleven Days of Christmas: America's Last Vietnam Battle (San Francisco: Encounter, 2002). Both the F-111 aircraft and controversy are well covered in Robert Art, The TFX Decision (Boston: Little, Brown, 1968); Robert Coulam, Illusions of Choice (Princeton, N.J .: Princeton, 1977); Jay Miller, General Dynamics F-111 "Aardvark" (Fallbrook, Calif .: Aero, 1981); Anthony Thornborough and Peter Davis, F-111 (London: Arms and Armour, 1989); and "General Dynamics F-111:The 'Earth Pig," World Airpower Journal 14 (Fall 1993): 42-101. 319 IARIES 2 The primary source for the treatment of winged standoff and decoy missiles is my study, The Evolution of he Cruise Missile (Maxwell AFB, Ala .: Air University, 1985). Soviet missiles are covered by David Donald, d. Tupolev Bombers (Norwalk, Conn .: AirTime, 2002), and the FAS databook. The ASD and SAC histories are very detailed and helpful, but some remain classified. Another valuable source on SAC is a history of one of its subordinate commands, Second Air Force Historical Data, from January 1 to June 20 1960, K243.01, HRA. Useful on the alert system is Henry Narducci, Strategic Air Command and the Alert Program: A Brief History (Offutt AFB, Neb .: Office of the Historian, SAC, 1988). 1 At the end of 1962 SAC had more than twenty-six hundred bombers and 142 Atlas, 62 Titan, and 20 Minuteman missiles. In addition there were IRBMS stationed in Europe and nuclear weap- ons on U.S. Navy ships and submarines. The Soviets had a few bombers and fifty ICBMs that could reach the United States. 2.
