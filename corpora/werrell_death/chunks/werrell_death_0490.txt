While these attacks had some limited effect, they could have been much more effective if cluster bombs had been used. The A-6s and F-111s could not use these weapons because of their low flying, but no explanation is given for non-use by the B-52s. 7. The USAF flew 36 percent of its sorties against railroad yards, 25 percent against storage facili- ties, 14 percent against radio communications facilities, 12 percent against power facilities, 10 per- cent against airfields, and 2 percent against SAM sites. 8. The SAC staff projected a 2 percent loss rate, which was astonishingly accurate. The SAC commander applied his judgment and for political reasons chose to overstate the estimate to arrive at 3 percent. 9. These losses were later attributed to a failure of a weld in the tailplane. More than half of the bombers inspected stateside showed faulty welds emanating from a faulty design. 10. Another source used 1,750 feet CEP for thirty-one missions. It states that on eleven runs under ideal conditions, the error was 233 feet, very close to the 220 feet achieved in training. 11. The F-111's gun also was removed. 12. The B-1B can carry twenty-four internally. 13. Reflex ended in March 1965, and ground alerts ended for the KC-97 in November 1965 and for the B-47 in February 1966. 14. Between 1950 and 1980 there were thirty-two incidents involving nuclear weapons, the majority involving SAC bombers. 15.
