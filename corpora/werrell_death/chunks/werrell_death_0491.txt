e were thirty-two incidents involving nuclear weapons, the majority involving SAC bombers. 15. The introduction of new radars that could sort out low-flying aircraft from the terrain mounted on interceptors and airborne radar aircraft did not appear until later. 16. AAF experience in World War II indicated that bombing accuracy in combat was only a fifth of that achieved in stateside training.  MIUS 320 SOURCE NOTES Chapter 10. Missiles The basic published sources on the ICBM are the older study by Edmund Beard, Developing the ICBM: A Study in Bureaucratic Politics (New York: Columbia University Press, 1976), and Jacob Neufeld's essential Ballistic Missiles in the United States Air Force, 1945-1960 (Washington, D.C .: Office of Air Force History, 1990); however, I found most useful the more accessible study by John Lonnquest and David Winkler, To Defend and Deter: The Legacy of the United States Cold War Missile Program (Washington, D.C .: Department of Defense, 1996). A general overall of the subject can be found in Alan Levine, The Missile and the Space Race (Westport, Conn .: Praeger, 1994). On the Titan see the detailed and footnoted study by Warren Greene, "The Development of the SM-68 Titan," Aug. 1962, K243.012-7, HRA. A documented history of the cruise missile can be found in my study The Evolution of the Cruise Missile (Maxwell AFB, Ala .: Air University, 1985). Most valuable on the Navy's ballistic missiles are Graham Spinardi, From Polaris to Trident: The Development of U.S. Fleet Missile Technology (Cambridge: New Cambridge University Press, 1994), and Strategic Systems Program Office, FBM Facts/Chronology: Polaris, Poseidon, Trident (Washing- ton, D.C .: Navy Department, 1996). Information on the Soviet missile program is scattered and difficult, at least for non-Russian readers; however, Steven Zaloga, Target America: The Soviet Union and the Strategic Arms Race, 1945-1964 (Novato, Calif .: Presidio, 1993) was most useful.
