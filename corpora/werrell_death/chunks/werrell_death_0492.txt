or non-Russian readers; however, Steven Zaloga, Target America: The Soviet Union and the Strategic Arms Race, 1945-1964 (Novato, Calif .: Presidio, 1993) was most useful. Also helpful are the Internet guides posted by the Federation of Atomic Scientists (FAS). Material on ballistic missile defense is drawn mainly from my Hitting a Bullet with a Bullet: A History of Ballistic Missile Defense (Maxwell AFB, Ala .: Air University Press, 2000). For a more detailed look at the politics of BMD during the 1990s and into the 2000s, see Bradley Graham's Hit to Kill: The New Battle over Shielding America from Missile Attack (New York: Public Affairs, 2001). 1. The key players included Bernard Brodie, Herman Kahn, Thomas Schelling, and Albert Wohlstetter. 2. Perhaps the most remembered aspect of this program was the death of Navy lieutenant Joseph Kennedy in a premature explosion of one of these aircraft. 3. Later the supersonic requirement was dropped and CEP loosened to eight thousand feet. 4. Neufeld, Ballistic Missiles, 142. 5. The Hiroshima bomb weighed 10,000 pounds and had a yield of 13 kilotons. The later ther- monuclear weapons weighed 1,500 pounds and had a 1-megaton yield. 6. The deployment modes had significant vulnerability differences. The original Atlas D was vul- nerable to 5 psi overpressure, in a covered coffin to 25 psi, and the "F" in a silo to 100 psi. 7. While the Titan I silo could withstand an overpressure of 150 to 200 psi, the Titan II had more protection, up to 300 to 350 psi. One example: Whereas the doors on the Titan I each weighed 125 tons, the one on the Titan II weighed 720 tons and was designed to withstand an overpressure of 1,000 psi. 8. Four Atlas and 3 Titan missiles were destroyed in their silos. 9. France, Greece, and Spain refused IRBM basing. 10. The Navy played up two differences: its system required two, not three, guidance stations and its booster was stowed with the missile and did not have to be attached just prior to launch, which
