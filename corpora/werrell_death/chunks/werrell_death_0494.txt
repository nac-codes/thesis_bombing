assault by ten thousand warheads. 19. The one hundred MX missiles would be based in superhard capsules spaced eighteen hun- dred feet apart, relying on the fratricide of incoming missiles to preclude all from being destroyed. Without realistic testing, the concept was unproven and questioned, although the Air Force believed that 50 to 70 percent of the missiles would survive an attack. 20. The Peacekeeper Rail Garrison concept consisted of twenty-five trains, each carrying two missiles, that would deploy from their bases during periods of international tension. 21. Protection came from the large numbers and basing, initially 3,350 on trucks or in silos hard- ened to withstand 7,000 to 8,000 psi overpressures. 22. The 2002 Moscow Treaty nullified START II and eliminated the de-MIRVing of ICBMs; hence a number of Minuteman IIIs retain their multiple warheads. 23. One setback in this movement to lessen nuclear armaments came as a result of the U.S. deci- sion in December 2001 to withdraw from the ABM treaty. As a consequence, the de-MIRVing of ICBMs stopped. The more significant issue is the number of warheads, not launchers. 24. Donald Baucom, The Origins of SDI, 1944-1983 (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1992), 34. 25. Observers note the discrepancy between the critics of BMD, who claim it will not work, and the protests of the Russians, who claim it will threaten them. Some believe the latter are merely attempting to reassert their position in world politics. Chapter 11. Strategic Bombardment into the Twenty-first Century The sources on the B-1, F-117, and B-2 are the standard ones noted above. Bomber acquisition is cov- ered in detail in Michael Brown, Flying Blind: The Politics of the U.S. Strategic Bomber Program (Ithaca, N.Y .: Cornell, 1992). On the B-1 see the detailed and excellent article by Bill Gunston, "Rockwell B-1B Lancer," World Airpower Journal 24 (Spring 1996): 52-113, updated in Ted Carlson,"B-1B Lancer in the EAF," International Air Power Re
