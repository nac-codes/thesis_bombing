the detailed and excellent article by Bill Gunston, "Rockwell B-1B Lancer," World Airpower Journal 24 (Spring 1996): 52-113, updated in Ted Carlson,"B-1B Lancer in the EAF," International Air Power Review 23 (2007): 38-45; for the political aspects see Nick Kotz's Wild Blue Yonder: Money, Politics, and the B-1 Bomber (Princeton, N.J .: Princeton University Press, 1988). A detailed government view in Congressional Budget Office, "The B-1B Bomber and Options for Enhance- ments," Aug. 1988, Washington, D.C. For stealth and the F-117, see my Chasing the Silver Bullet: U.S. Air Force Weapon Development From Vietnam to Desert Storm (Washington, DC: Smithsonian, 2003). On this subject I found the most valuable "published" source to be David Aronstein and Albert Piccirillo, "Have Blue and the F-117A," final draft, ANSER, Mar. 1997. For the B-2 I relied heavily on Bill Sweetman, "B-2 'Stealth Bomber," World Air Power Journal 31 (Winter 1997): 46-95.  322 SOURCE NOTES SOURCE My treatment of the 1991 Gulf War also draws on Chasing the Silver Bullet and the excellent, concise treatment by Richard Davis, Decisive Force: Strategic Bombing in the Gulf War (Washington, D.C .: Air Force History and Museums Program, 1996), which covers considerably more than the title promises and is also found as a chapter in Cargill Hall, ed., Case Studies in Strategic Bombardment (Washington, D.C .: Air Force History and Museums Program, 1998). All of these works draw heavily on the five-volume Gulf War Air Power Survey (Washington, D.C .: [GPO], 1993) edited by Eliot Cohen. John Warden laid out his ideas in The Air Campaign: Planning for Combat (Washington, D.C .: Pergamon-Brassey's, 1989). On PGMs I've used Chasing the Silver Bullet and the more recent work by Paul Gillespie, Weapons of Choice: The Development of Precision Guided Munitions (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama, 2006). The action in Bosnia-Herzegovina is the subject of the excellent and extensive study, Robert Owen, ed., Deliberate
