lift-to-drag ratio. The former was dictated by an engine without an afterburner (to minimize size and IR signa- tures) and the losses due to the inlet and exhaust design, a compromise that emphasized low observ- ables over engine performance. The low lift-to-drag ratio was a consequence of the faceting. 6. Although the F-117 is clearly an attack aircraft, the Air Force designated it a fighter. There is no explanation for this mischaracterization, although the USAF had done this earlier with the F-111.The F-117 has a length of sixty-six feet, a span of forty-three feet, an empty weight of twenty-nine thousand pounds, and a maximum takeoff weight of fifty-two thousand pounds, com- pared with the Have Blue, which measured thirty-eight feet in length and twenty-two feet in span and weighed nine thousand pounds empty and twelve thousand pounds maximum. 7.

Iraq controls 20 percent of the world's oil reserves, Kuwait 14 percent, and Saudi Arabia 25 percent. 11. The Iraqis had almost a million men under arms with the ability to mobilize another two million. They had 750 combat aircraft, including first line equipment, and hundreds of ballistic mis- siles. Baghdad's air defenses were considered twice as dense as the most heavily defended Eastern European target during the Cold War and seven times that which defended Hanoi in 1972. 323 I 12. The dramatic impact of PGMs is highlighted by the fact that F-105s bombing in the Hanoi- Haiphong area at the end of Rolling Thunder achieved a CEP of 447 feet with 5.5 percent direct hits, whereas in 1972 in the same area, guided bombs achieved a 23 foot CEP with 48 percent direct hits. 13.
