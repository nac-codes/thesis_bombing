In the northern Pacifica couple of islands changed hands; in the southwest Pacific a year thatbegan with battle lines drawn around Sanananda and Henderson Fieldended around Finchhafen and the northern Solomons. In Europe Alliedsuccesses remained largely peripheral, a fact reflected, not negated, by Italy’s invasion, surrender and occupation during the course of the year. Even on the Eastern Front 1943 ended with Soviet ar mies still far from the borders on which the Nazi–Soviet conflict began thirty monthsearlier.
