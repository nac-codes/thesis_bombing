s of 1943 fall under five headings: the five Allied confer- ences that collectively established the framework for the prosecution of the European war and the war against Japan; the Allied success in master- ing the U-boat threat; the gathering pace of the strategic air offensiveagainst Germany; the military operations that re-established the Westernallies on the continental mainland and also saw the Soviets clear most ofthe Ukraine; and the battle of production. Though obviously the Axisconduct of the war and the major part of Soviet deliberations and opera- tions fall outside their terms of reference, the Allied conferences providethe latticework of the year, and, indeed, of the remainder of the war, in noinstance more evidently than the decision made at the Casablanca con-ference (14–24 January) that the United Nations would not accept any-thing less than the unconditional surrender of the Axis powers. This decision remains controversial, many post-war commentators condemning it on the grounds that it hardened German resolve and madethe task of bringing about Germany’s defeat more difficult. This argu-ment is superficially plausible, though there seems no good reason toassume either that had the Allies adopted a less intransigent positionGerman resistance would have been less or that there could have beenan end to the German war on other terms.  The fact of the matter was that the European war’s terms of reference had been provided by the nature of Nazism and by the Anglo-French declaration of war in 1939.Germany showed no restraint either in aim or conduct other than thatimposed by the prudence before 1941 in tackling her enemies singly:Britain and France, rightly calculating that as long as Hitler ruled Ger-many there could be no peace in Europe, declared total war in 1939, and then failed to wage it.
