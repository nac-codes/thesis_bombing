After forty months of war there could be no changing aims that werestripped of ambiguity and which, when realised, would deny Germansany claim that they had been cheated into surrender. For twenty yearsthe victorious powers of the First World War had been subjected to anorchestrated German campaign of lies and deceit that had denied the reality of defeat in 1918, which asserted that the settlement of 1919 had been imposed by fraud, and which was used by Hitler as cloak for aggres-sion. Just as the Casablanca declaration eased the problems of the Alliesby postponing the solution of their various clashes of interest to thepost-war period, so this demand for unconditional surrender—issued atthe time when the Germans had just set about razing the Warsaw ghetto— made clear to Germany that this time there would be no excuses and no mitigation of defeat. The inter-war experience, the lack of any crediblealternative to Hitler within Germany, and the logic of the war itself madethe formal Allied demand for their enemies’ unconditional surrender in-evitable. If there are grounds for criticism of this policy then it lies in itbeing applied to all of Germany’s allies, though given the behaviour of Bulgarian and Italian armies in Yugoslavia it is difficult to see how these two enemies could have been excluded. However, in practice the Ameri-cans and British were not consistent.  The Italian surrender in September1943 was not unconditional, and neither the final Allied demands on Ja-pan—the Potsdam Proclamation of 26 July 1945—nor the final surrenderof Japan on 2 September were unconditional.
