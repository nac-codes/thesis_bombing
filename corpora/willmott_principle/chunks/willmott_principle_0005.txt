British were given no credit for their arguments to this effect. ButBritain’s insistence upon the prosecution of a campaign in Italy to anindeterminate end came to be regarded by the American high command in 1943, not altogether surprisingly, as reluctance to commit herself to any invasion of northern France, and even after the British did committhemselves to this effort at Quebec in 1943 there remained the questionsof whether or not the Italian campaign should remain the main Alliedeffort in the Mediterranean and how Allied efforts in this and the north-west European theatres should be coordinated.  These questions were not resolved until March 1944 and then not satisfactorily: it was not until July 1944 that issues were finally settled, but neither to British liking norto any useful military purpose. STRATEGIC POLICY—JAPAN AND CHINA With regard to the formulation of strategic policy for the war against Japan, Anglo-American difficulties were even more pronounced. Beforethe outbreak of the Pacific war the American high command concludedthat Japan could be defeated only by coordinated efforts in the Pacificand on the Asian mainland ( i.e., in China). But the devising of a strategyfor the Pacific proved very difficult for the Americans, in part becausePacific matters had to wait upon the settling of European priorities and timetables and in part because of inter-service rivalries.  After April 1942 the Pacific was divided into two American commands, one naval and theother army, and neither would accept subordination to the other. By theend of 1943, however, the weakness inherent in a divided command waspartially offset by the American ability to mount coordinated offensivesacross both the central and southwest Pacific, but it was not until Sep- tember 1944 that immediate American objectives in the western Pacific— in effect, the question of whether the Philippines were to be taken orbypassed—were decided.  The arguments on this score, in which thenavy lost to the ar
