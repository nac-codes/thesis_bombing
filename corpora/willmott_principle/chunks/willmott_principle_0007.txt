But the Roosevelt administration, having spent years extolling Chiang Kai-shek as the great leader of a mighty struggle against a barba- rous invader, could not repudiate Chiang and its previous version of events,and Chungking had its champions in the form of a powerful and vocifer-ous lobby in Washington that, in the final analysis, had the beating of theadministration and military. To compound these problems, this lobby contained within itself an equally strident air lobby. As part of its policy of supporting China in1941 before Pearl Harbor, the Roosevelt administration had provided cred-its, aircraft and facilities for pilots to enlist in a surrogate air force inChina. This organisation, legitimised once the United States entered thewar and headed by Colonel Chennault, embraced extreme air power doc-trines, the basis of its 1942 policy being that a strategic bomber force numbering fewer than 200 aircraft could bomb Japan into submission from bases in China if the entire American effort in China was geared tothat end.  The patent absurdity of this claim was obscured by the fact thatthe message itself, with its combination of high technology, low commit-ment and quick results, was tailored to American public expectation, butit was disputed by orthodox military opinion headed by the highly un- conventional Major-General Stilwell, appointed Chiang Kai-shek’s chief of staff and made responsible for the entire American effort in China inFebruary 1942.

As a result, the Americanmilitary effort in China was divided ag
