The basis of this British reluctance was the calculation that anyoffensive into Upper Burma from northeast India would involve the move-ment of formations through the mountains that ring Upper Burma againstan intact enemy operating on good lines of communication in theChindwin, Irrawaddy and Sittang valleys. The British reasoned, correctly, that a victory in Upper and central Burma was at best problematical, and that in any event an advance to Rangoon was out of the question. Withthese conclusions the American planning staffs reluctantly agreed, par-ticularly after the Guadalcanal campaign revealed the nature of Japaneseresistance. But to their subsequent argument that the British should com-mit themselves to a coordinated offensive with Chinese forces in the Hukawng valley and from Yunnan to clear Upper Burma with a view to building a through road to China, the British responded with three unan-swerable arguments: that the engineers needed to build a road behindadvancing armies were the same engineers needed to sustain the ad-vance in the first place; that such a road could carry no more supplies than those required by the forces needed to guard the road if Japa- nese formations remained intact and undefeated in central Burma; and a road could not be developed before 1946, by which time its useful-ness would be negligible given a timetable that scheduled the Ameri-can arrival in the western Pacific for early 1945. Moreover, an effectiveChinese contribution from Yunnan to this effort to secure a road fromnortheast India was dependent up
