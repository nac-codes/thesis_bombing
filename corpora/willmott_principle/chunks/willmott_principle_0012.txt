theJapanese navyâ€™s main strength in the next phase of operations, promisedto supply and support any British carrier and amphibious formations sentto the Pacific by June 1944.  Their intention was to hold British carriers as a reserve for their own carriers, which were expected to sustain heavy losses.  The British allowed this offer to pass by default, but as they turnedtheir attention to alternatives to a landing at Rangoon and the Americansto how such alternatives could complement their own operations, so theBritish slowly came to the realisation that wartime and post-war Euro-pean demands, plus the low birth-rates of the 1920s, meant that in 1944 Britain would have to choose between naval and amphibious forces in the Far East because she lacked the manpower for both. Moreover, in1944 Britain also realised that neither Australia nor India had the abilityto maintain either a naval or an amphibious force, and that India couldnot raise the assault divisions needed for any amphibious enterprise. Whatcompleted this dismal picture was the fact that what little British assault shipping was in the Indian Ocean in 1943 and 1944 was shore-to-shore, and what was needed for any enterprise was ship-to-shore. With all these conflicting options, demands, capabilities and limita- tions and the fact that not all the problems could be seen at a single time,it was small wonder that Anglo-American decision-making with regard toChina and southeast Asia was painstakingly slow and characterised by mutual misunderstanding and irritation. In the end, of course,  inter-Allied differences were resolved, ironically because the Japanese provided thesolution. The Japanese decision to invade northeast India, a course ofaction that they had considered in 1942 but discounted because of theimpossible logistics problems in mounting such an attack, resulted inutter disaster for the 15th Army around Imphal and Kohima between February and June 1944. It was a defeat that proved the validity of theBriti
