victory in the course of 1943, the surrender of the Italian navy in September 1943 and the subsequent incarceration of the battle fleet in the Suez Canal being acknowledgement and consummation of thisfact. In the Atlantic and British home waters the threat to Allied ship-ping from warships and auxiliary raiders had been largely eliminated,and that posed by mines, aircraft and light units reduced to very mi-nor proportions. German surface and air forces stationed in northern Norway remained a substantial menace to Allied Arctic convoys, but the real threat to the Allies were the German submarines still operating in the North Atlantic. Such was this threat and the success of German submarines in early 1943 that the Admiralty was to record the view that ‘the Germans nevercame so near to disrupting communications between the New World and the Old as in the first twenty days of March 1943. ’ In these twenty days German action accounted for 107 Allied merchantmen in the NorthAtlantic, and while the total of 120 merchantmen sunk in this single monthwas exceeded in eight months in 1942 the significance of the March1943 losses lay in the fact that ninety ships were lost from convoys, thoughthirteen were stragglers. The U-boat haul of seventy-two merchant- men from convoys in this single month contrasted with a previous highest monthly toll of fifty, and the total of thirty was exceeded inonly five months in the whole of the war. What made this month’slosses doubly significant was that in March 1943 North Atlantic con-voys were afforded protection on an unprecedented scale: on the basisof the Admiralty’s quarterly returns of escorts per convoy, 1 April 1943 represented the peak of escort deployment in the North Atlantic inthe Sec ond World War. Such was the extent of German success against convoys in the first three weeks of March 1943 that for the only time in the war the Admi-ralty questioned the validity of the system itself, and in the absence ofany credible alternative t
