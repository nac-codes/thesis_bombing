The events of May 1943 conformedto a pattern of operations that had been established since August 1942,and German success in March 1943 was the solitary exception to whatproved an otherwise irreversible process. Moreover, the months of Julyand August 1943 were perhaps even more significant than May 1943 in settling the outcome of this campaign. German losses in these two months—thirty-seven in July and twenty-five in August—were fewer thanthose sustained in May, but they were suffered by a service that had re-grouped in an attempt to reverse the verdict of the May fighting, and itsfailure in these two months was correspondingly greater than its previ-ous defeat.
