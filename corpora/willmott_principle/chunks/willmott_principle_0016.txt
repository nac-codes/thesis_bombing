dicated that the Kriegsmarine was losing the Battle of the Atlantic despite having the numbers after August 1942 that allowed it toform patrol lines for the interception of convoys on a comprehensivebasis for the first time. First, and by definition, losses from convoys weresustained only by those convoys that were attacked, and despite the for- mation of German patrol lines the majority of North Atlantic convoys were not attacked. In April 1943, for example, German submarines at-tacked eighteen convoys totalling 596 ships and sank twenty-five mer-chantmen, but nineteen convoys with 416 ships (and no fewer than 134convoys with 1,764 ships in American waters and the Caribbean) escapedGerman attention. Such was the context of the March 1943 losses. Sec- ond, in tackling the convoys that they did find, German submarines be- gan to experience significant losses because of the increasing effectivenessof the escorts, and indeed after August 1942 the exchange rate betweenmerchantmen and submarines in the convoy battles was ominously badfor the Kriegsmarine. With the exception of March 1943 when the rate reached 12:1, between September 1942 and April 1943 it hovered around the 4:1 level and in September would have been as low as 2:1 but for German success against Arctic convoys. Third, the returns by Germansubmarines in terms of merchantmen sunk per submarine in commis-sion and per submarine per month were in sharp decline. At no stageduring 1942 were submarines able to sink one merchantman per monthfor every one of their number in service, and in the last quarter of 1942 this figure fell below 0.5.
