Thus, even by January 1943 the results obtained by German subma- rines were wholly inadequate in terms of the Kriegsmarine ’s own ‘ton- nage warfare’ requirements, but the inadequacy of German performance was worsened by two further matters. Other than in the period between August and November 1941, the majority of German victims were shipssailing independently. In 1942, for example, of the 1,570 ships known tohave been sunk by enemy action 962 were merchantmen sailing inde-pendently, of which submarines claimed 840. The reduction of the num-ber of independently sailing merchantmen reduced the toll amongst such shipping in 1943 to 215 to all types of enemy action and to 189 to U- boats. Moreover, in the first quarter of 1943 new Allied construction forthe first time exceeded losses to U-boats since 1939, and in the thirdquarter of the year exceeded all losses to all causes since the outbreak ofwar.  What this meant, in effect, was that by March 1943, at which timethe Kriegsmarine was already six weeks behind its ‘tonnage warfare’ requirements for the year, German submarines had to quintuple theirMarch sinkings amongst merchantmen in convoy in order to offset thedecline in the number of sinkings of independently sailing merchantmenand new Allied construction and still reduce Allied resources by the re-quired 750,000 tons of shipping per month. This was impossible. TheGermans simply did not have the numbers to register such results, and even by the end of March 1943 the U-boat command had recognised that its submarines faced unprecedented difficulties in tackling convoys be-cause of the growing effectiveness of Allied escort forces.
