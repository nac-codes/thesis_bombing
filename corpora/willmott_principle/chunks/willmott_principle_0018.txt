nes faced unprecedented difficulties in tackling convoys be-cause of the growing effectiveness of Allied escort forces. DECISIVE CONVOY TACTICS These difficulties and the subsequent Allied victory were the result of the balance of technical and tactical advantage in the convoy battlestipping conclusively against the U-boats as a number of Allied counter-measures came together at roughly the same time. It is possible to definethese under five separate headings and to note that two, the introductionof continuous air cover for convoys in the North Atlantic and the firstappearance (but for a single operation in September 1942) of support groups in the battle, were tied directly to the winding down of the Torch commitment, the North African landings having had the effect of delay- ing both by at least four months. But the Germansâ€™ immediate difficultiesin late March 1943, and the basis of Allied success in the spring and sum-mer, lay in the continued expansion of escort numbers throughout 1942.By April 1943, when British oceanic strength approached the 600 mark, the British and Canadian navies had 490 escorts in the North Atlantic of EBSCOhost - printed on 10/6/2024 9:23 PM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

In addition, another 46 were with the Gibraltar and West African commands. With an averageof 27 convoys at sea on any day in 1943, the steady increase of escortnumbers throughout 1942 allowed the British to raise the average escortper convoy from six to eight in the course of 1943 and to concentrateunits in settled formations. Adequate numbers allowed the British to raise and train escort forces as groups and then to commit such groups intact to the battle, and their growing familiarisation with radar anddirection-finding equipment, the introduction of the Type 147 contact-holding Asdic in  April
