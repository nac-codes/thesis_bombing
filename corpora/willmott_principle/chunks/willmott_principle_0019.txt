oups and then to commit such groups intact to the battle, and their growing familiarisation with radar anddirection-finding equipment, the introduction of the Type 147 contact-holding Asdic in  April 1943, and the tactical improvement brought aboutby changed depth-charge patterns and spacings were the factors thatcombined to make attacks on convoys so very dangerous for U-boats in spring 1943. Growing escort numbers also allowed the Allies to raise support groups, formations not assigned the protection of specific con-voys but tasked to operate in waters used by U-boats and to go to the aidof threatened convoys. Between March and May 1943 one American andfive British groups, three with escort carriers, joined the Battle of theAtlantic, but with their accounting for only three of the forty-one Ger- man submarines sunk in May 1943 their main contribution to victory was in helping to ensure that there was no revival of the U-boat menaceafter summer 1943: the crucial battles of the spring were won by theordinary escorts and shore-based aircraft. ALLIED AIR POWER The significance of air power in the Battle of the Atlantic in spring 1943 can be gauged from the fact that whereas Allied aircraft accountedin whole or in part for fifty-two U-boats between 3 September 1939 and31 December 1942, in May 1943 Allied aircraft sank twenty German sub-marines and shared in the destruction of another five. The extent of thesuccess of Allied air power in May 1943 in large measure explains the dramatic quality of events in this month, but in reality German losses to Allied aircraft had begun to assume significant proportions even beforeMay 1943—twenty-nine were sunk in the first four months of 1943—andthe extent of the German defeat in May was exaggerated by a Germanoperational failure that was continued through the summer. But the sig-nificance of air power in May 1943 was that in spring of that year the British were able, for the first time, to tie air power directly to convoy de-fence
