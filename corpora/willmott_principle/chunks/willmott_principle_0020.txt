was continued through the summer. But the sig-nificance of air power in May 1943 was that in spring of that year the British were able, for the first time, to tie air power directly to convoy de-fence in two forms: continuous air cover for convoys in the North Atlanticbecame possible with the appearance of escort carriers in significant num- bers, and Very Long Range (VLR) Liberators similarly became availablefor the Battle of the Atlantic in telling numbers at exactly the same time. The first of the new generation of escort carriers entered service in the Atlantic in March 1943, and their impact was immediate if largely EBSCOhost - printed on 10/6/2024 9:23 PM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

Aircraft from escort carriers sank forty-one U-boats in the course of the war and shared another seventeen with surface escorts andshore- based aircraft, but their main achievement was in providing recon- naissance and contacts for escorts, and also in denying German subma-rines the ability to track and gather around a convoy without risk ofattack.  As more escort carriers became available German submarines lost the twin abilities to wait until a convoy drew beyond the range of shore-based aircraft before mounting attacks and to run on the surface inmid-ocean with impunity. Similarly, the intervention of VLR Liberatorseroded these abilities which, by spring 1943, were two of the last tacticaladvantages remaining to German submarines. In February 1943 the Allies had 312 long, 316 medium and 474 short-range aircraft detailed to maritime duties on both sides of the NorthAtlantic, but at this crucial stage of the war just eighteen VLR Libera-tors—capable of sustained operations at ranges beyond 650 miles fromland—were available for the Battle of the Atlantic. Of this number nonewere west of Iceland and nine were committed to
