n VLR Libera-tors—capable of sustained operations at ranges beyond 650 miles fromland—were available for the Battle of the Atlantic. Of this number nonewere west of Iceland and nine were committed to patrol operations ratherthan convoy protection.  This paucity of  VLR numbers was the result of an American reluctance to commit such aircraft to maritime duties in the Atlantic (but not the Pacific) and a resistance on the part of R.A.F . BomberCommand to any diversion of resources from its attempt to bomb Ger-many into submission. The priority afforded the winning of the Battle ofthe Atlantic at the Casablanca conference served notice that such intran-sigence would not be tolerated indefinitely, but it      was the losses of March 1943 that finally forced the commitment of VLR squadrons to convoy defence in sufficient numbers that proved so important in May 1943. Inthe event the number of such aircraft thus committed remained incred-ibly small, but the total of forty-nine with R.A.F . Coastal Command al-lowed between twelve and fifteen Liberators to spend an average of threehours with convoys beyond 650 miles from land on every day of May 1943, and their destruction of ten U-boats either around or en route to and from convoys was the final material ingredient in the Allied victory in the convoy battles of the same month. Equally important, but outsidethe convoy battles, patrol aircraft also accounted for nine U-boats in May.Such patrols were generally unrewarding during the war, though theydid account for twelve U-boats in the first four months of 1943, but at the end of April a series of night attacks on German submarines crossing the Bay of Biscay convinced the U-boat command that Allied aircraft wereable to locate surfaced submarines from transmissions from their Naxossearch receivers. These, fitted throughout the U-boat fleet since the pre-vious September, were able to detect airborne radar transmissions on the standard 1.5-m. frequencies in use in British patrol
