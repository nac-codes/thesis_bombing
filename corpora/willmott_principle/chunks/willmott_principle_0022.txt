search receivers. These, fitted throughout the U-boat fleet since the pre-vious September, were able to detect airborne radar transmissions on the standard 1.5-m. frequencies in use in British patrol aircraft since 1941. By February 1943 the British had developed a 10-cm. radar that could EBSCOhost - printed on 10/6/2024 9:23 PM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

DEFEAT OF U-BOATS, 1943â€“1944 The attacks of April 1943 plus the German refusal to believe that the Allies had been able to develop airborne centimetric radar led the U- boat command into a series of operational mistakes over the spring months. Initially, night crossings of the Bay of Biscay were abandonedand submarines were ordered to run on the surface in daylight in orderto recharge batteries, but when this resulted only in increased contactswith, and losses to, Allied aircraft the German response was to order U-boats first to stay on the surface and fight their attackers and then to sail in company for mutual protection. With the summer came increased anti- aircraft armament for submarines and, ironically, a system of convoyingU-boats across the Bay of Biscay by surface and air escorts, but centimetricradar, shallow-set depth charges and later rocket projectiles for use againstsurfaced U-boats provided Allied aircraft with a decisive superiority overGerman submarines throughout the summer of 1943. Indeed, in mid-year, as sinkings by escorts declined with the German withdrawal from the main shipping lanes,  Allied aircraft for the only time in the war becamethe main agent of submarine losses. Between June and August 1943 theU-boats lost seventy-four of their number in sinking fifty-eight merchant-men, this figure being the same as the number
