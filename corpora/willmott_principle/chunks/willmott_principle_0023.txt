e war becamethe main agent of submarine losses. Between June and August 1943 theU-boats lost seventy-four of their number in sinking fifty-eight merchant-men, this figure being the same as the number of German submarinessunk by ship-borne and shore-based aircraft. In 1943, as a whole,  Allied aircraft registered 140 single kills to the fifty-nine by surface forces. Thus the combination of increasing escort numbers and effective- ness, the provision of support groups and the timely development of a small but adequate number of VLR aircraft to convoy defence pro-vided the Allies with the material means whereby the U-boat threatwas mastered in mid-1943.  But this Allied victory was not complete and final in itself.   The nature of naval warfare precluded a single, deci- sive victory, and just as at no time in British naval history had anyvictory in battle lessened the need for convoy and blockade so thevictory of mid-1943 had to be repeated throughout the remainder ofthe war. Indeed, the effort involved in the struggle to retain commandof the sea after mid-1943 was to increase until the peak of British escort strength in the North Atlantic was to be reached, predictably, in July 1944 when no fewer than 619 escorts were operational in theNorth Atlantic and British home waters: Western Approaches Com-mand did not attain its maximum strength of 296 escorts until April1945. Even with this considerable growth of numbers after May 1943,the Allies were unable to do more than contain the U-boat threat as German construction kept pace with sinkings: in 1943 the loss of 237 EBSCOhost - printed on 10/6/2024 9:23 PM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.
