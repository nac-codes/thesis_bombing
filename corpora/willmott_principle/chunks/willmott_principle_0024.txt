E  OF WAR U-boats was countered by 272 entering service and in 1944 losses totalled 248 boats while 242 were commissioned into service. LikeWestern Approaches, the U-boat service reached its peak strength—444 boats—in April 1945, but the outcome of the submarine campaignagainst shipping was decided not just by numbers but by effective-ness: in 1944 German submarines sank 132 merchantmen of 773,327 tons—fewer ships but a greater tonnage than lost to all causes in June 1942 alone. In the spring and summer of 1943 Allied naval and airescorts secured a stranglehold on the submarines which the subma-rines never broke, and thereafter the main effectiveness of the U-boatservice was in continuing to tie down Allied naval resources ratherthan in the destruction of commerce. The fifth and final element that provided the Allies with victory in mid-1943 was the superiority of operational command established bythe Allies over the Kriegsmarine , and particularly by the Admiralty over the U-boat service, at this stage of the war.  This superiority both stemmedfrom and resulted in decisions that provide the hidden framework of thewar at sea, the clear advantage that the Allies secured in research and development being perhaps the most obvious example of German inferi- ority in the wider aspects of operational detail. In the conduct of theBattle of the Atlantic this Allied advantage extended to operational re-search, Admiralty studies in autumn 1942 revealing, somewhat surpris-ingly, that convoy losses were not related to convoy size and that anincrease in the average size of convoys from the current thrity-two mer- chantmen to fifty-four should reduce losses by 56 per cent. The resultant reduction of the number of convoys as a consequence of the increasedsize of individual convoys also allowed the number of escorts detailedfor convoy duties to decrease even as the scale of protection affordedconvoys increased. 1 As a direct result of such findings, convoy size rose steadily from th
