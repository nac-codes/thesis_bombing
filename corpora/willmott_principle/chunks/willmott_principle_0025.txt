allowed the number of escorts detailedfor convoy duties to decrease even as the scale of protection affordedconvoys increased. 1 As a direct result of such findings, convoy size rose steadily from thirty-two in January 1943 to an average of sixty-two in mid-1944: the largest single convoy of the war, HXS 300 in July 1944, numbered 164 merchantmen, and such was the measure of escort supe-riority at that time that its seven oceanic escorts conveyed a million tonsof commerce and war material to Britain without loss. NAVAL INTELLIGENCE BATTLE No less significant than development programmes and operational 1 The size of convoys depended upon area, escort numbers upon perimeter. On the basis of average numbers, a mid-1944 convoy of sixty-two merchantmen was 10.8 per cent better protected by nine escorts than a January 1943 convoy ofthirty-two ships had been protected by six escorts, and the saving of escortnumbers was about 22.6 per cent.

In part this intelligence advantage derived from the network of agents developed throughout occupied Europe—the first warning of the Bismarck ’s sortie in 1941 was provided by a French naval source that re- ported that the Brest dockyard had been ordered to prepare for her arrival— but the most important British source, and the basis of the Admiralty’sadvantage, was signals intelligence.  The British penetration of Germannaval ciphers began in 1940 but it was not until May 1941, when codesand an Enigma cipher machine were recovered from a U-boa
