ty’sadvantage, was signals intelligence.  The British penetration of Germannaval ciphers began in 1940 but it was not until May 1941, when codesand an Enigma cipher machine were recovered from a U-boat, that the British were able to read signals in the Kriegsmarine ’s general-purpose cipher on a regular and timely basis.  Thereafter, and with only brief ex- ceptions, the British read German naval traffic covering the Baltic andMediterranean, and signals for coastal and mine warfare units in Franceand Norway. Until February 1942 the British were also able to read U-boat operational signals, but in that month the U-boats were switched to a separate Triton cipher and it was not until December that this system was broken. For most of 1942, therefore, the British fought the Battle ofthe Atlantic without access to German operational signals, but after De-cember 1942—and with a nine-day gap in the crucial month of March1943 when another German procedural change blinded the British—thisability to read U-boat signals, the workings of the Operational Intelligence Centre, and the analyses of the Submarine Tracking Room enabled the British to move to a position in 1944 whereby the Admiralty, on its ownclaim, knew more about U-boat positions than did the U-boat command.Arguably the most important naval intelligence coups were those thatresulted in the destruction of the battleship Scharnhorst off North Cape on 26 December 1943 and the damage inflicted in a carrier raid on the battleship Tirpitz on 3 April 1944 in the Kåfjord after, and not before, she had completed repairs to damage sustained the previous September, but the most important Allied intelligence successes were those obtainedafter December 1942 almost on a routine, daily basis at the expense ofthe U-boats. Thus the German attempt after the defeat of May 1943 toconcentrate against American convoys bound for the Mediterranean was countered by the deployment of three American support groups to the Azores where they sank
