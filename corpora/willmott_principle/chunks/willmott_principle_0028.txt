be decommissioned,but while this instruction was later countermanded, the previous failureto build up the fleet and its current lack of fuel, enforced inactivity andtransfers to the U-boat service left the dwindling surface force unable todo more than effect a ‘fleet-in-being’ strategy that ended, as it had to end, in piecemeal destruction and total defeat. The U-boat service, on the other hand, survived its defeat of May 1943 because of its numbers, but it could not respond quickly and effec- tively to the various technological changes that rendered its standardType VIIC and Type IX boats obsolete. Indeed, by 1943 the submarine, asit had evolved since 1897, had reached the limits of its development, and what Germany needed was a proper submarine of good underwater per- formance, not a submersible. In 1943, however, the planned Walter boatswere some three years from entering service, and approval for the con-struction of two interim classes, the Types XXI and XXIII, was not givenuntil 8 August. By the time that the lead boats were accepted into servicein June 1944 Germany’s defeat at sea could not be reversed, and some- what appropriately the first operational mission of an oceanic Type XXI boat began on the day of Hitler’s suicide. ASPECTS OF GERMAN DEFEAT AT SEA In order to continue the war at sea after mid-1943 the U-boat com- mand adopted three measures: the commitment of U-boats to distant waters, specifically off southern Africa and in the Indian Ocean; the intro- duction of submarine snorkel breathing apparatus that enabled a subma-rine to recharge its batteries while submerged; and the introduction of anumber of new weapons, most notably the T4 and T5 acoustic torpedoes.None of these proved more than palliatives. No amount of success indistant waters could compensate for defeat in the North Atlantic, and German success in the Indian Ocean lasted no longer than it took to EBSCOhost - printed on 10/6/2024 9:23 PM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.
