Thesnorkel made detection by airborne radar very difficult but only at theexpense of greatly degraded performance, while acoustic torpedoes notonly had a low rate of success—somewhere between 7 and 11 per cent—but had the singularly unfortunate effect of forcing escorts to use a hith- erto little used but one of their most effective weapons properly. In 1941 the British had developed a forward-firing mortar, known as the Hedge-hog, in order to allow escorts to engage a submerged boat while stillretaining asdic contact. The Hedgehog was first used in December 1941and made its first kill in February 1942, but its initial training programmeswere hurried and inadequate. Moreover, the weapon itself proved un- popular at sea because it could be used only at low speed, and escorts had developed a marked preference for high-speed depth-charge at-tacks. As a result, the Hedgehog was largely neglected until the use ofacoustic torpedoes. The most effective counter to such torpedoes waslow speed, and thereafter the Hedgehog and its various successors cameinto their own and exacted an increasing toll on U-boats after January 1944. The fact that the Kriegsmarine developed various types of homing torpedoes in an attempt to provide U-boats with the means of eliminat- ing the escorts preparatory to attacks on merchantmen with conven-tional torpedoes obliquely raises the question of whether or not theGermans should have sought battle with the escorts from the very start of the campaign at sea.  This issue, of course, invites a much wider ques- tion
