ng than those imposed by the naval staff and were in any event inaccordance with the navy’s own doctrine that warship raiders shoulddecline action with escorts whenever possible. Moreover, despite thegenerally uncritical assessment of the U-boat command’s conduct of theBattle of the Atlantic, it is at least arguable that throughout the first four years of the European war the German naval command consistently failed to maintain its own selected aim. Allowing for a certain diversion of forceas inevitable because Norway had to be defended and Italy supported,the U-boat command’s constant switch of the point of attack, the prob-ing for weak spots, was not unlike the surgical knife that cuts away thesecondary cancers while leaving the primary growth untouched. Had the U-boat command accepted the losses inherent in attacks on even poorly defended convoys before mid-1942 when screens seldom con-sisted of more than four slow escorts, it is at least possible that the con-voy system could have been overwhelmed before the escorts had time todevelop their strength—and perhaps a policy of sea denial might havebeen made to work. GERMAN DEFEAT AT SEA With all the problems that are presented by the advantage of hind- sight in terms of seeing a defeat as inevitable, the jumble of half-digestedconcepts that the Kriegsmarine termed a strategy left the German navy vulnerable to defeat on two counts. It committed the Kriegsmarine to a stern chase with an almost non-existent force operating from a positionof geographical disadvantage against an enemy of greater resources andwith time to counter German moves and make good its losses, if only inpart. The handicap of geographical disadvantage was to be eliminatedbetween June 1940 and June 1944, yet even this did not allow the Ger-man navy to prevail against an Anglo-American enemy that built 42,485,000 tons of merchant shipping between September 1939 and April 1945. In addition, the idea of sea denial by time or area or both was notan effe
