In the Euro- pean theatre geography and technology imposed severe restrictions uponthe offensive use of sea power, and shore-based aircraft were the primarymeans whereby the Allied powers completed their naval victory, thoughit must be noted that the destruction of German ports, as distinct fromtheir immediate hinterland, eluded the victors.  Allied air power accounted for eight of t
