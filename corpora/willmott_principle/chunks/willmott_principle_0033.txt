s completed their naval victory, thoughit must be noted that the destruction of German ports, as distinct fromtheir immediate hinterland, eluded the victors.  Allied air power accounted for eight of the nine major German warship losses of the last year of the European war by direct attack, but such success was belated and had nopractical effect upon the outcome of the war at sea. More important, but for the occasional blockade-runner after 1940, Allied sea power drove German commerce from the oceans and deprivedGermany of most of her seaborne trade from the very start of the war, but this achievement, in common with the traditional British policy of fight- ing protracted wars of attrition, took effect only in the last year of theEuropean war when the loss of her earlier conquests finally forced Ger-many to wage war on the basis of her own resources. The extent of theseconquests had largely freed Germany from dependence upon sea-bornetrade, and allowing for the 89 per cent decline of fishing returns between 1938 and 1942 and the fact that in 1942 Swedish ships carried 53 per cent of Germanyâ€™s iron ore imports, until 1944 Germany controlled morethan enough shipping to meet her trade requirements. In 1944, however,German shipping resources were not sufficient to maintain the level ofSwedish ore imports after Swedish shipping was withdrawn from thistrade, and by May 1945 a German merchant marine that had begun the war with 4,492,708 tons of shipping had been reduced to just 1,583,151 tons.  The greater part of German losses, amounting to 1,052,095 tons ofshipping or 42.3 per cent of the German merchant navy on 1 January1944, was incurred in the last sixteen months of the war, but it was notuntil 1945 that the German minesweeping fleet was finally overwhelmedand German coastal trade collapsed.  Apart from the Baltic, where Ger- man surface forces continued to operate until the very end of the war and which, for the most part, was beyond the range of aircraft based in Bri
