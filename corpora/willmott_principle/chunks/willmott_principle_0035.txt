the Anglo-American strategic air offensive against Germany. To summarise arguments that were fiercely contestedwell into the third decade after the end of the European war, there was abody of opinion that held that this offensive had little or no effect uponthe outcome of the war while a contrary view asserted, with equal cer-tainty, that victory over Germany could not have been won without this campaign. Between these extremes emerged the view that the air offen- sive made a significant contribution to victory, but in the articulation ofthis undoubtedly correct assessment obvious problems of fact and inter-pretation of what was achieved and how the campaign could have beenbetter prosecuted arose to complicate proceedings.  Amidst these con-flicting claims, however, it is possible to note certain matters which, if not beyond dispute, at least provide the terms of reference for a dispas- sionate examination of this campaign. First, and most obviously, the Anglo-American strategic bombing offensive manifestly failed to achieve the independent victory that advo-cates of air power in the inter-war period and a number of wartime  Al-lied commanders believed was possible, if not certain. Second, the offensive nevertheless resulted in Germanyâ€™s economic and industrial collapse before her final military defeat was accomplished.  The Ruhrwas physically isolated from the rest of Germany as a result of the de-struction of its canal, rail and road networks, and its factories had beenbrought to a standstill before it was surrounded by American forces.The difference in time between the two, however, was minimal.
