forced a diversion of German resources into air defence that had impor- tant if unquantifiable consequences on the conduct of the war. By theend of 1943 German air defence numbered a million flak troops, and1,500,000 men were held as labour detailed to the repair of damage causedby bombing raids. German output was increasingly geared to fightersand flak defences at the expense of offensive weapons. In addition, by this time some 70 per cent of the Luftwaffe â€™s fighter strength was com- mitted to the defence of German cities, and German formations on the Eastern Front and in Italy had been stripped of their air cover: in the lasttwo years of the war Allied field armies fought with the advantage ofoverwhelming air superiority, which was the by-product of the strategicair offensive against Germany.

If nothing else, this was a source of hope to thosewho lived under the tyranny of Nazi occupation and arguably the Alliedair offensive justified itself for this reason alone. The fact that between 1940 and 1943 bombing was the only offen- sive option available to the British and American
