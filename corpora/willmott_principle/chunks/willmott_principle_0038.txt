ccupation and arguably the Alliedair offensive justified itself for this reason alone. The fact that between 1940 and 1943 bombing was the only offen- sive option available to the British and Americans was important in thatit provides the corrective to one of the most important arguments aboutthis campaign which may be discussed at this point in order to dismiss itfrom further consideration. Both during and after the war the question ofthe value of the strategic air offensive was inextricably linked with moralissues, and it cannot be denied that Allied claims of moral superiority over Nazism sit uneasily alongside such episodes as the razing of Dresden in 1945. The strategic bombing campaign, with first its acceptance ofcivilian casualties as the inevitable, if unfortunate, by-product of opera-tions and then the concentration against civilian targets as an act of policy,is not easy to reconcile with the Christian doctrine of the Just War, firstdefined by Aquinas in the thirteenth century, with its moral imperatives the avoidance of the unnecessary taking of life and the sparing of non- combatants. But in respect to the strategic bombing campaign as a whole,morality existed only in choice, and German civilian casualties could havebeen avoided only if the Allies had chosen deliberately to deny them-selves a means of attack that Germany had employed from the start ofhostilities. Moral justification can always be rationalised, not that the Al- lies considered it necessary at the time to justify the strategic bombing offensive in moral terms, but there existed in the warâ€™s middle years nei-ther political nor military reasons, and no good moral consideration, thatwould have justified the Allies denying themselves their only means offorcing Germany to respond to their initiative by a dissipation of battle-front strength and industrial effort. To have accepted such self-imposed limitation would have constituted a betrayal of the Allied cause itself, of the Allied armies in
