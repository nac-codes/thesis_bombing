Nazi–Soviet conflict.  The Soviet achievement was nevertheless very modest,as indeed was that of R.A.F .  Bomber Command before February 1942. Though the British effort before this month divided into several distinct phases the operational pattern established in the first thirty months ofthe European war revealed that the R.A.F ., which owed its survival in theinter-war period to its presentation of strategic bombing as its raison d’être, could not carry out precision attacks on German industrial and military targets as it continued to claim. In part, the reason for this failure was navigational problems, the full extent of which had not been appre- ciated before 1939, but the fundamental problem that confounded R.A.F .Bomber Command’s attempt to develop a strategic offensive was thesimple fact that the balance of advantage had shifted in favour of thedefensive fighter since the time, in 1932, when the sometime British primeminister, Stanley Baldwin, had made his famous—if heavily qualified— prediction that ‘the bomber will always get through. ’ For most of the inter-war period this was indisputable: the perfor- mance of bombers and fighters in terms of speed and ceiling were roughly equal and indeed the first monoplane bombers of the mid-1930s wereconsiderably superior to fighters, particularly in speed.  At a distance ofseveral decades it is very easy to forget that the reversal of advantages came both late and suddenly, around 1937, with the introduction of high- performance monoplane fighters into service with various air forces. Thisdevelopment, along with radar, airborne radar and combat control cen-tres, provided the defence with the means to detect and concentrateagainst incoming bomber formations, and the vulnerability of bombersin daylight to fighters designed and tasked to destroy them was con- firmed in the Battle of Britain when the Luftwaffe was forced to bomb by night in order to avoid prohibitive losses. R.A.F .  Bomber Command, how- ever, had suffer
