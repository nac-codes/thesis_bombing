Bomber Command, how- ever, had suffered the same experience and had come to the same con-clusion even before the Battle of Britain. Despite the fact that inter-war air theory had stressed the deter- rence aspect of bomber forces, R.A.F . Bomber Command was singularly ill-equipped to carry out a strategic air offensive in 1939, and at the outbreak EBSCOhost - printed on 10/6/2024 9:23 PM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

The lateness of British rearmament meant that the R.A.F .  couldnot come into possession of a sizeable heavy bomber force until 1942, and Bomber Command began the war with just thirty-three squadrons, seventeen of which were equipped with Battle and Blenheim light bomb-ers which were incapable of making an effective contribution to a strate-gic air offensive. The balance of its squadrons were equipped withHampden and Wellington light and Whitley heavy bombers which lackedthe range-payload combination essential to mounting potentially destruc- tive raids and the self-sealing tanks, armour and defensive firepower nec- essary for survival over Germany.  This fact of life was forcibly impressedupon R.A.F . Bomber Command during December 1939 when two day-light operations each resulted in the loss of more than half of the attack-ing force. On 18 December, in a raid that involved no real penetration ofGerman air space, radar-directed fighters accounted for
