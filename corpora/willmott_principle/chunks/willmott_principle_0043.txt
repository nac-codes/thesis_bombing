This directive ordered Bomber Command to concentrate its efforts against German refineries, storage depots andsynthetic production plants as its first priority. A further directive of 13July restored Germany’s aircraft industry as Bomber Command’s prioritytarget, but this was changed by yet another directive of the twenty-fourththat presented Bomber Command with a mix of targets. This constant switch of operational priorities throughout the summer of 1940 partially explains the ineffectiveness of Bomber Command’s operations—exceptin its attacks on invasion shipping—in these months, but it was a processthat was continued into the autumn. Indeed, this constant change of pri-ority was compounded by Bomber Command’s being ordered to attackcommunications centres and to mine, and also to carry out retaliatory raids on German cities after the raid on London of 24 August. On the night of 25–26 August eighty-one bombers attacked Berlin, and after thedeliberate terror-raid on London on 7 September the R.A.F . was detailed tobomb cities without specific reference to industrial and military targets. SUCCESSFUL R.A.F . FAILURES The constant switch of priorities in the second half of 1940 was by no means the major factor in Bomber Command’s ineffectiveness at thistime, and indeed even if it had been left to concentrate against a singlepriority target it could not have achieved any
