At no stage could Bomber Command muster more than 300 op-erational aircraft, and once maintenance and reserve needs lowered this total to about 150 more than twenty to thirty bombers were seldom avail- able to any single night’s operations. Further, the April decision that for-mally committed Bomber Command to night bombing and the subsequentdirectives that set out priorities were based upon Bomber Command’scarrying out precision attacks at night, and this limited such operationsto periods of full moon.

Thus Bomber Command could attack no more than a limite
