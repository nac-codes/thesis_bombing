entrated its efforts against the German oil indus-try German stocks rose as a result of increased production and imports and cuts in consumption. Thus Bomber Command could attack no more than a limited part of the German economy with an inadequate number of bombers on an intermittent basis, but throughout the autumn it continued to claim con-siderable success in its operations, particularly against the German oilindustry. It based its claims on pilot reports and upon theoretical statisti- cal studies, one of which suggested, in the form of a paper presented to the British war cabinet on 16 December, that the German output of syn-thetic oil had been reduced by 15 per cent despite only 6 to 7 per cent ofBomber Command’s effort being directed against it. In making such claimsBomber Command either deceived itself or was deliberately mendacious.In circumstances that demanded success and when Bomber Command had to justify itself and its priority claims on future production, the R.A.F . provided the illusion of success even though by November 1940 the airstaff and Bomber Command had become aware that a significant numberof bombers failed to find and attack their designated targets. This wasindeed the case, and was the final reason for Bomber Command’s failurein its offensive at this time. The realisation that the precision attack con- cept was flawed began to push the new heads of the air staff and Bomber Command towards the conclusion that if bombing could not achieve itsaim then the aim had to be changed to take account of what was tacti-cally and technically possible. In effect, in the last quarter of 1940 the air staff and Bomber Com- mand tentatively recognised that if bombers could not find anything smaller than cities then cities had to be attacked as a matter of policy because neither of the alternatives—either a return to daylight raids orno bombing at all—represented a practical proposition. But another fif-teen months were to elapse before the logic of this conc
