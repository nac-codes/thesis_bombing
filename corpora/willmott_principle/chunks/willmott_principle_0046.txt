because neither of the alternatives—either a return to daylight raids orno bombing at all—represented a practical proposition. But another fif-teen months were to elapse before the logic of this conclusion was ac-cepted by the R.A.F . and Bomber Command in the form of the areabombing directive of 14 February 1942. Meanwhile, four major develop- ments—signposted by three major directives—both delayed and made inevitable the commitment of Bomber Command to attacks intended tobreak German morale. The first development was a r esult of the first Photo-Reconnaissance Spitfires entering service in November 1940 and conducting a reconnais- sance of two synthetic plants at Gelsenkirchen on 24 December.

This re-connaissance revealed that plants assumed to have been extensively dam-aged were in full production and bore no obvious signs of major damage.This was the first incontrovertible evidence that aircrews forced to relyupon astro-navigation, map reading and dead reckoning to find their tar- gets were failing in their attempt to carry out a night-time precision of- fensive, but rather than strengthening the case for area bombing thisconclusion perversely led to the decision to concentrate all BomberCommand’s resources against just seventeen named oil installations inan attempt to ensure their destruction in the course of a four-monthoffensive. Bomber Command received its formal directive to this effect on 15 January 1941, but despite having the first of the Stirling, Halifax and Manchester heavy bombers in service Bomber Command spent thenext ten weeks vainly trying to
