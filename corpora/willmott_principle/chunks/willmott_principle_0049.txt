was successful. These various issues were considered at different levels within the British high command during spring 1941 with the predictable resultthat issues were fudged. The 7 July directive that emerged from thesedeliberations as the fourth development on the road to area bombingcommitted Bomber Command to attacks on both cities and key commu- nications bottlenecks, but in so doing it evaded the problems at the heart of a strategic bombing policy. By instructing Bomber Command to con-centrate against seven transport choke-points and six cities the air staffcalculated that bombers that missed their targets would neverthelessinflict worthwhile collateral damage, but the policy of continuing preci-sion bombing by making targets less precise counted for nothing if Bomber Command remained without the navigational aids needed to guide bomb- ers to those targets, and if the aim of operations was to strangle the Ger-man transport system, then collateral German civilian casualties did notrepresent a satisfactory quid pro quo. Moreover, Bomber Command re- mained without the numbers needed to raze German cities, and in anyevent the basis of the directive—that German communications could be paralysed by the destruction of seven key complexes and that German morale could be broken by the flattening of six cities—was somewhattenuous, by any standard. The July directive was unsound in its reasoning and unrealistic in the tasks it set Bomber Command, but while Bomber Command was to spend the summer months trying to achieve results well beyond its slender means and capabilities failure on two other fronts combined to force the EBSCOhost - printed on 10/6/2024 9:23 PM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.
