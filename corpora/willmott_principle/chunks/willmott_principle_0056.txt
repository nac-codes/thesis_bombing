Bomber Commandand American air commanders regarded it as the basis for procrastinationin their dealings with superiors rather than for mutually supporting op- erations, and between January 1943 and March 1944 the American and British bomber forces conducted their separate wars even as commonproblems emerged to frustrate their different efforts. The first of these problems arose because German cities and indus- try proved to have unexpected powers of resistance and recuperation.Modern cities, with wide roads and open spaces, were subjected to enor- mous local damage but could seldom be devastated over an extended area. The thousand-bomber raid on Köln, for example, resulted in only469 German deaths and the destruction of one square mile of the citycentre, and even where devastation was more substantial losses of pro-duction were usually measured in days and weeks rather than months.Some 8.7 square miles of Hamburg were destroyed in the firestorm raids of 24 July–3 August, but the city’s port and shipyards were hardly affected despite the massive disruption of civil life and numbers killed.
