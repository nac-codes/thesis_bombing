--- 284 THE GREAT CRUSADE concentrated as to be vulnerable to air bombardment, and the fact that throughout 1943 German industry operated well below capacity pro-vided a slack that could be taken up in order to absorb the productionlosses that were sustained. Compounding this problem for the Americans and British was the reality that neither had the strength to mount sustained operations that could inflict telling cumulative damage, while bad weather, over Britain or Germany, imposed its own restrictions upon the conduct of opera-tions. Moreover, both the Americans and British were prevented frommounting successive follow-up attacks because of the need to switchtargets in order to preserve tactical surprise. This became increasinglyimportant with respect to deep-penetration operations as the scale and effectiveness of German defences grew during the course of 1943. By September 1943 a front-line strength of some 500 day and 350 nightfighters (plus over 33,400 flak guns) had been concentrated by theLuftwaffe in defence of German airspace, and it was around this time that the German daylight effort peaked with a series of battles that endedwith the 8th Air Force temporarily admitting defeat. The two most important single battles were fought on 17 August and 14 October, the first resulting in the 8th Air Force losing sixty-fourheavy bombers and having another 168 damaged from the total of 376sent against the ball-bearing factories at Schweinfurt and the aircraft plantsat Regensburg while another sixty-seven were lost and 138 were dam-aged in the October raid on Emden and Schweinfurt by 320 aircraft. Al- though such losses were exceptional, routine operations in the first ten days of October 1943 cost the 8th Air Force 139 heavy bombers at a timewhen its average front-line strength was little more than 400 Fortressesand Liberators, and it was the combination of such losses that finallyconvinced American air commanders that air supremacy had to be se-cured as the prerequ
