At the same time R.A.F . Bomber Command, which had reached this conclu- sion in 1940 but which had switched to night operations in order toavoid the insoluble problems thus presented, found that the German com-bination of Freya early warning, Würzburg tracking and Lichtenstein A-1airborne radars had reversed the previous balance of advantage in nightoperations and had rendered the bomber stream highly vulnerable to Bf 110 and Ju 88 night-fighters.

By the endof March 1944, at a time when R.A.F . Bomber Command had a daily aver-age strength of 974 heavy bombers, the British had exhausted the vari-ous counter-measures—fighter-bomber attacks on German airfields, activeand passive jamming of German radars, and voice disruption of German communications—that had been developed in order to limit losses. In- deed, by this time R.A.F . Bomber Command had been brought to the edgeof defeat and had manifestly failed to bring about the collapse of Ger-many that its commander,
