oped in order to limit losses. In- deed, by this time R.A.F . Bomber Command had been brought to the edgeof defeat and had manifestly failed to bring about the collapse of Ger-many that its commander, Air Marshal Harris, had claimed on 7 Decem-ber 1943 it could achieve by 1 April 1944. This April deadline was critical in the conduct of the Allied strate- gic bombing campaign because in the winter of 1944 the question of airpower’s role in the defeat of Germany emerged as the most importantsingle issue confronting the American and British high commands in theconduct of the European war. The idea of the combined bombing offen-sive, as settled at Casablanca and in the Pointblank directive, had been acharter, devised by the bomber lobby, for the defeat of Germany by bomb- ing alone, yet as Anglo-American strategic policy evolved in the course of 1943 with the result that the invasion of northwest Europe— Operation Overlord— emerged as central to that policy with a timetable settled for summer 1944, so the issues of bomber operations preparatory to inva-sion and command of the strategic forces during the spring and summerof 1944 presented themselves for solution. At its simplest, Operation Overlord had assumed such a priority in the Anglo-American prosecu- tion of the war that it could not be made dependent upon the successfuloutcome of the strategic air offensive, but while the Overlord command sought control of the bomber forces in order to attack German defencesand lines of communication in the pre-invasion phase and to support theground forces once ashore, the bomber commanders, whether American or British, sought to preserve their own freedom of action and insisted that their forces’ most significant contribution to an invasion of north-west Europe—privately derided as unnecessary and irrelevant—remainedthe destruction of German industry and morale. In the winter of 1944 the bomber lobby lost this argument, in part because the Overlord commander, General Eisenhower,
