won after December 1943 primarily stemmed from the fortunate coincidence oftheir realising that air superiority had to be won before bombing couldbe effective and their coming into possession of the means whereby thatsuperiority could be won. Until April 1943 the 8th Air Force had to relyupon short-range P-38 Lightnings and R.A.F .  Spitfires to provide its bomb- ers with cover as far as the German border: thereafter the P-47B Thunder- bolt was added to the supporting cast and escorted American bombersover western Germany.  After July 1943, with the appearance of the P-47Cand drop tanks for both Lightnings and Thunderbolts, American fightersoperated ever deeper into Germany in defence of the heavy bombers,and the German switch from forward to in-depth defence was partially a response to this development. But while the later Thunderbolts were able to escort the strategic bombers as far as Berlin their overall perfor-mance was inferior to that of the Fw 190/Ta 152, the mainstay of theGerman daylight defensive effort. On 1 December, however, the first P-51B Mustangs arrived in Britain for service with the 8th Air Force, andafter flying operationally in Europe for the first time on the thirteenth this aircraft proved that it could do battle with an Fw 190 over Berlin on better than equal terms. Moreover, at this same time, with the 8th AirForce in Britain and the 15th Air Force in Italy brought under a singlecommand in order to subject Germany to coordinated American attacks,the Americans were able to commit their growing numbers of fightersnot simply to the defence of the heavy bombers but to seeking out Ger- man fighters across the whole of Germany. Such was the success of both fighter efforts that by the spring of 1944 German fighter losses wereaveraging 500 per week and both the number and quality of theLuftwaffe ’s daylight effort were in irreversible decline.
