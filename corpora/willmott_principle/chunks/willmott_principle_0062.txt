The German night-fighter service nevertheless retained an effectiveness lostto the day-fighter arm until March 1945, but by the end of 1944 it was notable to man its full operational strength, partly because by that time the cumulative effect of decisions taken in 1941 and 1942 had worked their way through the Luftwaffe ’s infrastructure with increasingly baleful re- sults. In 1941 the Luftwaffe had stripped virtually all its training estab- lishments in order to execute Operation Barbarossa in the expectation that the defeat of the Soviet Union would enable it to resume quickly itstraining schedules and to redeploy formations to western and southern Europe with no serious ill-effects. Failure to defeat the Soviet Union in 1941 along with the disruption of training programmes had serious long-term implications for the Luftwaffe that were compounded in 1942 by a refusal to credit declared American intentions with respect to future air-craft construction. By the time that the German high command realisedthe depth of American material resources and the constancy of American purpose, it was too late for the Luftwaffe to respond effectively to the escalation of the air war explicit in the American commitment to the strategic bombing campaign against Germany. The result was that while Ger
