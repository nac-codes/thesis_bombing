too late for the Luftwaffe to respond effectively to the escalation of the air war explicit in the American commitment to the strategic bombing campaign against Germany. The result was that while German aircraft production rose dramati- cally after 1942, from 11,776 in 1941 to 39,807 in 1944, the patterns ofboth production and deployment became distorted while German op- erational strength remained more or less constant throughout 1943 and 1944. In 1939 and 1940 fighters formed 32.95 per cent and combat air-craft 61.9 per cent of total German aircraft production. By 1944 thesefigures had risen to 77.6 per cent and 88.9 per cent respectively, butwhile the Luftwaffe ’s offensive capacity slumped in 1943 and 1944 its operational strength of 1,006 single-engine fighters in March 1943 rose to only 1,188 in March 1944 despite the fact that in the first quarter of 1944 German monthly production of single-engine fighters reached fourfigures for the first time.  The massive increase of production in the courseof 1944, from monthly runs of 1,236 single-engine fighters in the winterto 2,776 in the summer, came too late for a German air force facing anAmerican air force that had increased its combat strength in Britain from 1,260 aircraft in May 1943 to 4,242 in December 1943 and to 8,351 in May 1944. Despite transferring fifteen groups and more than a thousandheavy bombers to the 15th Air Force after October 1943, the 8th AirForce reached an operational strength of 2,000 heavy bombers on—ofall days—6 June 1944. In the battle of attrition that the A.A.F . imposedupon the Luftwaffe after January 1943 but which entered its decisive phase after December 1943, such numbers assured the Americans of avictory over an enemy that by mid-1943 was overcommitted on three EBSCOhost - printed on 10/6/2024 9:23 PM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.
