This complicated and highly specialised subject presents problemsof presentation and integration within a general history of the war,though the relative performance of the major powers can be summarisedsimply: the Axis preoccupation with the acquisition of resources con-trasted with the Allied practice of expanded capacity and output, and in a protracted war of attrition this conferred on the Allied powers an over-whelming material advantage that was applied on the battlefield to ever-increasing effect during and after 1942.  This basic simplicity of definitionincorporates, however, a host of matters, peculiar to each of the powers,that defies simple and comprehensive examination. For the purpose ofsetting out the industrial context of the war, therefore, the economic performance of the great powers in the course of the Second World War will be summarised under two counts: a general statement about selectedaspects of individual national performances and a consideration of thecommon problems that beset the efforts of the Axis powers. In very different ways the individual performance of each of the five major powers—Britain, Germany, Japan, the Soviet Union and the United States—was impressive, if not in whole then in part. Between 1939 and 1943 Britain outproduced Germany despite Germany’s muchsuperior industrial capacity, and even in 1944, when Germany out-produced Britain 3:2 in aircraft num
