not in whole then in part. Between 1939 and 1943 Britain outproduced Germany despite Germany’s muchsuperior industrial capacity, and even in 1944, when Germany out-produced Britain 3:2 in aircraft numbers, Britain nevertheless continuedto outbuild Germany in terms of aircraft weight, which in many wayswas the more accurate yardstick of aircraft production than mere num- bers. Moreover, despite massive naval construction programmes and in- creasingly onerous refitting and maintenance commitments, Britain andher dominions built 8,217,000 tons of shipping between September 1939and April 1945, and with the various contributions provided by the lesserEuropean Allied powers, such as the Netherlands and Norway, were ableto cover the total of Allied and neutral losses to submarines in the course of the Second World War. For her part, Germany in the course of hostili- ties produced what were arguably the best quality tanks to enter serviceand pioneered the development of guided missiles, jet aircraft, strategicrockets and high-speed submarines. Japan, despite the smallness of herindustrial base, completed ten fleet and light fleet carriers after Decem- EBSCOhost - printed on 10/6/2024 9:23 PM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

The SovietUnion’s industrial achievement after June 1941, when she outproducedGermany in guns, tanks and aircraft, was remarkable in terms of her lackof a developed automobile industry to serve as the base for the diversifi- cation and expansion of production and the loss of her most heavily industrialised regions in the first disastrous months of war. The United States, of course, was in a class of her own.  A
