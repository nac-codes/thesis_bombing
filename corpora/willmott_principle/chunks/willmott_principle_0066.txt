iversifi- cation and expansion of production and the loss of her most heavily industrialised regions in the first disastrous months of war. The United States, of course, was in a class of her own.  A nation that between 1922 and 1937 completed just two dry-cargo merchant-men completed in March 1943 alone 140 Liberty ships, the record con-struction time for one of these pre-fabricated 7,517-ton vessels being 80.5 hours. The peak of American aircraft production, a total of 9,113 aircraft in March 1944, was all but equal to the combined production ofthe other four major powers, and in the course of the war the UnitedStates, which raised about a hundred divisions in the course of hostilities,supplied her allies with military, industrial and civil aid the cash value ofwhich was equivalent to the sum needed for her to raise either 2,000 infantry or 555 armoured divisions. In addition, the often forgotten contributions of the lesser powers were no less impressive in light of available resources and were not lim- ited to industrial matters.  Australia, perhaps the only country ever tohave built a combat aircraft before an automobile, enlisted one in two ofher men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five by voluntary means, and at the peak of her war effort had 89.4 per cent of her male popula- tion over fourteen years of age either in the armed services or in directwar work. Canada, after many trials and tribulations, raised a navy thatafter April 1943 provided 49 per cent of the escorts for oceanic convoysin the North Atlantic, a contribution that was only just less than that ofBritain in this theatre. India, despite famine, the virtual collapse of much of her coastal trade after 1942 and a rail system that was smaller in terms of locomotives than the largest of the British regional companies, pro-vided the bedrock of the Allied war efforts in the Middle East and south-east Asia and served as the base for support for China. Moreover, shemaintained some twenty divisions
