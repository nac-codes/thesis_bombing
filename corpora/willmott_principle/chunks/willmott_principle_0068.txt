o the fact that the Allies alone had the industrial, financial, intel- lectual and moral resources to engage in major research and develop-ment outside the immediate demands of the war. For all the veryconsiderable German success in weapons development, the Axis powersregistered no non-military achievement that compared to those of theirenemies. AXIS STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS Common to the three major Axis powers were aspects of political, industrial and administrative organisation that prevented their full andeffective mobilisation of resources, the extent of the restrictions upontheoretical potential being demonstrated by the fact that whereas in 1942 the productive capacity available to the European powers was superior to that of the United States the latter outproduced Germany four-fold.The most obvious and persistent factor in Axis difficulties, however,stemmed from the fact that Axis rearmament dated from the mid-Thirtiesand each of the three major Axis powers embarked upon war between1939 and 1941 when already at the peak of the production possible within existing political, industrial and financial restraints that effectively pre- cluded simultaneous expansion of industrial capacity. Once the war thatthey had initiated did not provide the Axis powers with the rapid victo-ries that had been anticipated, the lack of long-term planning for theexpansion of industrial output—and it took even the United States anaverage of thirty-one months from building site to airframe production— left the Axis powers without the time and means to meet the demands of the wars in which they found themselves engaged. The disparity betweenthe Axis and Allied camps became more pronounced with the lengthen-ing of the war into its fourth and fifth years despite a massive expansionof production on the part of Germany and Japan after 1943. At the heart of Axis problems in meeting the demands of total war were fundamental difficulties of organisation, most obviously in terms of EBSCOhost - pri
