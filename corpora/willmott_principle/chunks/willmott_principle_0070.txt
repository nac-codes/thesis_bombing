Germanindustry was concentrated towards capital goods production and Japa-nese industry to cheap, mass-consumer items: unlike American and Brit-ish industry, neither was geared to end-manufacture that could be adaptedfairly easily to war production and which primarily required the expan- sion of supply in order to achieve increased output.
