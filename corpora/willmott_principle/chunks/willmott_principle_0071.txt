In Germany and Japan state direction and owner- ship were regarded with suspicion by industry only too aware of latenthostility on the part of government and the military. In these countries, moreover, the position and attitudes of the mili- tary also served to create other problems of organisation. In Japan therivalry between the two armed services manifested itself in a struggle for resources that was carried to absurd lengths: both ignored the agencies established in 1943 to plan resources; the army built its own ships; thetwo services developed their aircraft and radars separately; and Japanwas the only major combatant not to have an atomic bomb project forthe very simple reason that she had two, one for each service. In bothGermany and Japan the armed services consistently sought to control the procurement process and to define the terms of reference, either in the initial specification or subsequent modification, of required weap-onry. Without the scientific and technical capability or the necessary co-operation with industry, the Axis powers tied output to changing andoften ill-defined requirements at the expense of production, and in bothGermany and Japan this problem was exaggerated by the primacy of de- signers, not production managers, in industry. For example, Japan in the course of the Pacific war produced no fewer than ninety different air-craft compared with the eighteen of the United States, and with Japaneseproduction between 1942 and 1945 totalling 64,800 aircraft 104,446 aero-engines and 126,339 tons of airframe to American construction aggre-gates of 279,813 aircraft, 728,467 engines and 1,029,911 tons of airframe the American advantages in terms of settled production runs, economy of scale and concentrated research and development are obvious. With ahighly diluted labour force and a largely imitative as opposed to innova-tive tradition, Japanese industry f
