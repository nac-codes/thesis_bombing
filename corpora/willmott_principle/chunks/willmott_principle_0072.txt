duction runs, economy of scale and concentrated research and development are obvious. With ahighly diluted labour force and a largely imitative as opposed to innova-tive tradition, Japanese industry faced problems that were more severethan those of Germany, which nevertheless faced the same basic prob-lems as Japan relative to her enemies. With no supervisory agencies that could assess realistic research and development times against military requirements and machine toolprogrammes for industry, German research was too widely spread andindustry too prone to disruption because of changing requirements tocompete with enemies that combined quantity production, economy ofscale and concentrated development. Only on the Eastern Front did Ger- man weapons retain any qualitative superiority over their opposite num- bers throughout the period of hostilities but not by a margin thatcompensated for numerical inferiority, and with regard to the Westernpowers German achievements in terms of jet aircraft and rockets were atbest double-edged. The Me262 presented fuel, maintenance and opera-tional problems of nightmarish proportions, and the V-weapons programme, specifically the V-2 effort, involved scientific and resource EBSCOhost - printed on 10/6/2024 9:23 PM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

The bombardment of London after June1944 by V-weapons was irrelevant to Germanyâ€™s requirements and theoutcome of the war, and impressive though certain German developmentprojects undoubtedly were German research achievements were for themost part reactive, never produced antidotes to Allied material superior- ity, and were strategically defensive in application and of limited value.
