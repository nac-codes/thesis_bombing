ctive, never produced antidotes to Allied material superior- ity, and were strategically defensive in application and of limited value. ALLIED ADVANTAGES In contrast to the position and practices of the Axis powers, the three major Allied powers both collectively and individually enjoyed cer- tain intrinsic advantages and made a number of key decisions that pro- vided them with a decisive material advantage in wars that were fought to Allied strengths after 1941. Most obviously the United States, and to alesser extent the Soviet Union after spring 1942, had access to domesticresources of continental proportions and enjoyed a geographical isola-tion and invulnerability against attack on industry denied other coun-tries. No less important, throughout the war the Allied powers enjoyed command of the sea and with it the ability to tap resources globally: in terms of inter-Allied movement of material this same ability to use thesea allowed the United States to supply the Soviet Union with 17,499,861tons of material, of which 23.77 per cent was moved through the Gulfand Iran and 47.11 per cent across the north Pacific in Soviet ships com-pared to the 22.65 per cent shipped through White Sea ports. The Soviet Union, with its experience of five-year plans, freedom from normal com- mercial constraints, docile labour force and minimal consumer demand,was able to concentrate production upon material requirements, and bya ruthless selection of relatively simple but very reliable weapons sys-tems she accepted what was no more than marginal qualitative inferior-ity in return for marked numerical superiority. Whereas the Germans presented problems for themselves in producing tanks and guns de novo, the Soviets concentrated tank and self-propelled gun development on existing chassis, and thereby ensured a continuity of production thatduplicated that of Britain and the United States in other fields, most obvi-ously in the output of aircraft. These two powers, Britain in the three ye
