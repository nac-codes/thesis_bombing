nd thereby ensured a continuity of production thatduplicated that of Britain and the United States in other fields, most obvi-ously in the output of aircraft. These two powers, Britain in the three years before the outbreak of war in Europe and the United States in 1940 and 1941, separately madethe common decision to mobilise for protracted wars of attrition and toconcentrate research and development on projects already in hand which could be completed within the expected duration of hostilities. TheAmerican decision had one notable disadvantage in that it forestalledtank development by limiting armour to the dimension of projected land- ing ships, but in other fields these decisions were vindicated impressively.

Two of the most successful Britishaircraft of the war, the Lancaster heavy bomber and Typhoon fighter-bomber, evolved respectively from 1936 and 1937 specifications for otheraircraft types and the Americans developed the DC-3 from a 1935 civilian airliner design. The concentration of research and development upon as- pects of component performance rather than aircraft type enabled theAmericans, and the British to a lesser extent, to engage upon mass pro-duction with the minimu
