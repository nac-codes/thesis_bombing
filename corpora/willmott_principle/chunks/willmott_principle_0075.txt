of research and development upon as- pects of component performance rather than aircraft type enabled theAmericans, and the British to a lesser extent, to engage upon mass pro-duction with the minimum of disruption and investment: thus the set ting- up of assembly lines for the first Spitfires involved 800,000 man-hourswhereas the subsequent fifteen combat marks together required a fur- ther 69,000 man-hours. Both the United States and Britain possessed major automobile industries that provided about half of the wartime expansionof their respective aircraft industries, and in the United States there werelicensing arrangements and pooled production techniques between com-mercial rivals that were unthinkable in Germany and Japan. Both Britainand the United States possessed labour unions that accepted dilution, and neither country was trapped by self-deluding nonsense about qual- ity production and the exclusion of women from industry that so besetthe German war effort. The Allied powers were not without their failings, most notably the Americans with respect to tanks, the British in terms of carrier aviationand the Soviets with respect to radar development and communications equipment, but in overall terms the three Allied powers utilised certain basic advantages to full effect and fought accordingly. The Americans hada highly skilled manager class, an experience of production-line tech-niques that was applied to ships and aircraft, and the imagination to workon scales that were beyond the comprehension of those with the limitedhorizons of central Europe and Tokyo. The Soviet Union, by virtue of scale, and Britain, on account of a system of state control probably without equal amongst the warring nations, supplemented the American effort tothe full extent of their resources, and in so doing the Allied powersachieved both a massive increase of production and a balance of produc-tion that eluded their enemies. Both Germany and Japan reached thepeak of their aircraft pr
