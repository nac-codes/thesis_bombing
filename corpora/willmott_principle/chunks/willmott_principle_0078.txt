ght the same type of battle—and for part of the time over the very sameterrain—as it had fought in the immediate aftermath of the Stalingraddefeat. With respect to this last matter, four possible answers suggest them- selves: that by the second half of 1943 the Soviet army was too strong, too well organised and too effective to be caught a second time; that after July 1943 the Soviet army fought in such a way as to prevent aneffective German response; that Manstein’s success at Kharkov in Febru-ary 1943 was not all that it was and is claimed to be. The fourth answercombines the previous three and, by removing the element of personal-ity from proceedings, fixes the proper basis of assessment and analysis, namely that in a conflict between systems, 1943 witnessed not simply a massive quantitative growth of the Soviet army but an improvement interms of command and organisation at the strategic and operational levelthat condemned the Wehrmacht to defeat at Kursk and to a series of local and limited reverses throughout the Ukraine in the following eightmonths. This qualitative improvement of the Soviet army in 1943 was not completed—by its own terms of reference—until 1944, in which year the benefits of these changes and enhanced mobility brought abouta succession of battles of encirclement and annihilation of German for-mations that had proved beyond the Soviet army in the second half of1943. In thus explaining the campaign on the Eastern Front in 1943 theunderlying factors in the crucial change that takes place during this year— the Germans’ loss of the strategic initiative—become self-evident, as does the relative balance of importance between theatres in the sense that ananalysis of events on the Eastern Front places the Mediterranean theatrein its proper and lesser, almost minor, context.
