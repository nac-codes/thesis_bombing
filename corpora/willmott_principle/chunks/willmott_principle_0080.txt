But after the reverse at Kharkov the Soviet high command, far from fear- ing a German summer offensive as has been suggested in certain Westernhistories, accepted a defensive battle at Kursk as the means of breakingGerman offensive power rather than seeking out German armour throughoffensive action. This Soviet decision was made on the basis of certain knowledge of German intentions, the conventional wisdom being that the source ofGerman intelligence was not the Red Trio network as was widely assumedfor many years but an ability to read German army signals following thecapture of Enigma cipher machines in the course of the winter’s fighting.Be that as it may, and it is known that the British passed relevant Ultrainformation to the Soviets in spring 1943 without disclosing its source, as the spring advanced and the extent of German preparations became clear despite the hesitations and doubts of Hitler and his senior com-manders, so Soviet counter-measures in and behind the Kursk salient as-sumed an extent and nature that finally laid to rest the ghosts of November1941 when the entire strategic reserve available to the Soviet army num-bered just fourteen tanks and of October 1942 when the 4th Tank Army was raised with its numerical designator indicating the number of tanks it had under command.
