At army level the Soviet army hadmechanised or armoured corps as mobile groups and had solved ques-tions of fire density and artillery concentrations in the assault to its ownsatisfaction. It had also accepted the principle of a ruthless concentra- tion of resources and operational talent with mobile forces in order to make maximum use of its limited means with the result that its infantry,despite having organic tank and anti-tank elements at all levels, remainedunder-invested in terms of training, quality and equipment. The most ob-vious weaknesses of the Soviet army were its lack of mechanisation forthe infantry; the lack of standardisation of armies; a
