inedunder-invested in terms of training, quality and equipment. The most ob-vious weaknesses of the Soviet army were its lack of mechanisation forthe infantry; the lack of standardisation of armies; an incomplete programme of raising tank and mechanised armies as mobile groups for fronts; its inexperience in deep-penetration operations; and its lack of atactical air force with a quick-response capability. But by spring 1943 theSoviet air force, which has been generally neglected in Western accountsof the 1943 campaign, had some 5,500  combat aircraft under command and had acquired a size and effectiveness that made it a match for a Luftwaffe able to muster only some 2,260 combat aircraft over the East- ern Front at this time. AIR POWER ON THE EASTERN FRONT By mid-1943 the Soviet air force had raised one air army for each of the armyâ€™s thirteen fronts plus a further nineteen air corps, with a total of2,600 combat aircraft, that could be used to reinforce air armies for the duration of specific operations. The result was that whereas throughout1942 Soviet air armies seldom mustered more than 350 aircraft, by mid-1943 main sector air armies had as many as a thousand aircraft undercommand. At the outset of the battle of Kursk, for example, the two airarmies with the Central and Voronezh Fronts possessed 1,915 combat aircraft, and were supported by two more air armies, of roughly similar size, in the reserve role. Despite such numbers, however, the Soviet airforce was unable to achieve air superiority over Kursk and both sideswere able to mount punishing attacks on enemy armour in the course ofthe battle. While Western attention had fixed on the disastrous Sovietattempt to mount a pre-emptive attack on German airfields on the morn- ing of 5 July the fact remains that the air battles over Kursk in July came EBSCOhost - printed on 10/6/2024 9:23 PM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.
