July–September 1943 was one ofthe very few quarters during the Second World War when the Luftwaffe ’s overall and operational strengths declined, and by more than a thousandaircraft. To this decline, at a crucial stage of the air war with the American bombing effort about to increase significantly in scale and tempo, Soviet tactical air power made its full contribution, though not to the extent ofthe 1,500 air victories claimed in Soviet accounts of Kursk. The Sovietclaim that Anglo-American forces ‘landed in France in 1944 without muchopposition from the Luftwaffe chiefly because the bulk of its forces had been smashed on the Soviet–German front the year before’ is overstated. Given the fact that the Anglo-American combined bombing offensive is rightly seen as crucial in the process whereby the Allies secured tacticalair superiority over all fronts, events on the Eastern Front in that yearprovide an important corrective in noting the importance of tactical airpower—and not just on the Eastern Front—in the progressive weaken-ing of the Luftwaffe during 1943. Most certainly the operations over Orel in July and August 1943 were the last occasion when the Luftwaffe was able to mount an effort with major repercussions on the course of opera-tions on the ground: thereafter its dissipation and declining quality ren-dered it no more than an increasingly ineffective tactical response to alost strategic situation. DECLINE OF BLITZKRIEG Leaving aside aviation matters, Kursk’s significance was profound, most obviously in terms of the erosion of
