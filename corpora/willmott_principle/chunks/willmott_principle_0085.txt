ducting a defensive battle without anyclear idea of where the Soviet army might make its effort, partly becausethe economic importance of the eastern Ukraine to Germany precluded voluntarily ceding ground, and partly because political considerations demanded a German offensive come the summer, the German high com-mand chose to attack the very strongest part of the Soviet front. Had it known the extent and scale of Soviet defences around and behind Kursk the German high command would probably never havecommitted itself to this offensive. Indeed, long before 1 July, when Hitler finally ordered the attack to proceed, certain of his senior commanders suspected that successive postponements of the offensive had given theSoviet army so much time to prepare to meet the attack that the Germaneffort was doomed to failure. In fact, by the time that the German attackbegan on the fifth the Soviet army had prepared eight defensive beltscovering the southern approaches to Kursk and the entire Soviet defen- sive network extended over a depth of 120 miles with the positions oc- cupied by the Steppe Front, in reserve behind the salient, fortified thoughnot on the scale of those held by the Central and Voronezh Fronts within the salient itself. With some 28,000 guns and mortars and 5,000 tanksdistributed amongst the three Soviet fronts at Kursk, and tank armiesheld in readiness for counter-offensives once the German offensive ex- hausted itself, Kursk was one of the very few battles in which a major armoured offensive began with the defence massively superior in man-power, material and position to the attack. But whilst Soviet success atKursk can be explained in terms of defence in depth and the weightof fire that was directed against German armour as it tried to fight itsway through successive defensive positions, the real point to emerge from Kursk was that the scale of conflict had by 1943 reached a level that effectively marked the end of the superiority of the offence overthe de
