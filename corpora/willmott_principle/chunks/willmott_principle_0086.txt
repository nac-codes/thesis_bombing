cessive defensive positions, the real point to emerge from Kursk was that the scale of conflict had by 1943 reached a level that effectively marked the end of the superiority of the offence overthe defence and of the efficacy of Blitzkrieg technique as hitherto practised. German success between 1939 and 1942 owed as much to the German armed forces’ better understanding of the balance between of- fensive and defensive firepower as it then existed as to any material con- sideration. Opposed by a number of enemies of limited military resourcesand inferior doctrine, the Wehrmacht had been able to defeat opponents lacking adequate anti-tank and anti-aircraft defences and—crucially—thespace and time in which to absorb the shock of a Blitzkrieg attack. De- spite its obvious battlefield manifestations, Blitzkrieg was a psychologi- cal as opposed to a material phenomenon, yet by 1943 the Soviet army EBSCOhost - printed on 10/6/2024 9:23 PM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

In spring 1943 the Soviet army had the choice of countering aGerman offensive through the use of space or by shock action of its own. But in using the latter, through the concentration of field and anti-tank artillery on unprecedented scales, the development of personnel anti-tank weapons and the use of massed armour in an anti-tank role, plus theproliferation of minefields, events served notice of the growth of defen-sive firepower at the expense of the offensive with obvious implicationsfor the future conduct of the break-in phase of offensive operations. The British had glimpse
