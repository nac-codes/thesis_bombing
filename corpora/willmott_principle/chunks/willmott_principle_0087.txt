rved notice of the growth of defen-sive firepower at the expense of the offensive with obvious implicationsfor the future conduct of the break-in phase of offensive operations. The British had glimpsed this same development at the second Alamein, and with their American allies were to experience to the full the practicaldifficulties of breaking through a position defended in depth and wheresurprise and manœuvre were of limited value. But the main manifesta-tions of this development were to be revealed in the very special condi-tions of the Eastern Front, where, by 1945, the increase of defensive firepower and the increasing vulnerability of armour to anti-tank systems were such that the Soviet army calculated that an 8:1 superiority of armourwas needed to overcome a prepared defensive position and in certain offen-sives in the last months of the European war armoured superiorities of40:1 on selected axes of advance were registered by Soviet formations inorder to ensure the survival of sufficient force for breakout operations. /ornament21 KURSK–OREL After 5 July 1943 there was a continuity of operations on the East- ern Front that prevents the ready division of the campaign into distinct phases either by time or by area. By limiting examination of the cam- paign to events before 3 November 1943 one can define events on theEastern Front under three headings: the initial phase of the battle of Kurskwhen the Wehrmacht held the initiative; the Soviet counter-offensives both in the Kursk–Orel area and on the Mius that properly form part ofthis same battle; and the subsequent Soviet offensives that by November 1943 had resulted in the Germans being cleared from half of the territory occupied by Army Groups Centre , South and A in June 1943. Of this initial phase little need be considered in light of the mass of literatureabout this subject other than to note that the line of demarcation betweenthis and the subsequent phase is not precise.
