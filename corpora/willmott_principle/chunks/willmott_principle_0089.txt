opments, and the one usually cited in Western histories as critical in Hitler’s decision to end the offensive,was the Anglo-American invasion of Sicily on 10 July, but while this de-velopment was given by Hitler as reason to abandon the Kursk offensiveduring his consultations with his senior commanders on the thirteenth,Hitler did not halt the attack on this day and it was not until the seven- teenth that he ordered II S.S. Panzer Corps to be withdrawn from the 4th Panzer Army for service in Italy. Even then, only the 1st S.S. Panzer Divi- sion was moved to Italy, and indeed this was the only German division transferred from the Eastern Front in July and August for service else- where. What was far more important in Hitler’s decision on the thirteenthto limit the Kursk operation but allow Army Group South to continue its attempt to seek out and destroy enemy armoured reserves were indica-tions of an impending attack on the Mius by the Southwest and SouthFronts and, on 12 July the start of an offensive by the Bryansk and WestFronts against the 2nd Panzer Army across a 170-mile sector of the Orel re-entrant. This Soviet effort formed part of the intention to counter-attack at Kursk once the German offensive stalled, but in the event Op- eration Kutuzov began perhaps one or two days too late, the 9th Army being able to break off operations in front of Olkhovatka on the twelfth.Moreover, the Stavka was apparently unable to capitalise upon the veryconsiderable success registered by Kutuzov on the twelfth. Army Group Centre diverted reinforcements bound for the 9th Army to the 2nd Panzer Army with the result that while the Soviet drive broke into the 9th Army ’s rear areas on the fifteenth Kutuzov degenerated into a slow rolling battle EBSCOhost - printed on 10/6/2024 9:23 PM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.
