Army Group Centre ’s ability to contain the threat presented by Kutuzov— the 9th Army did not be- gin to withdraw from its positions until the seventeenth—perhaps sug-gests that the Soviet effort began too early rather than too late, but thefact that it opened on the day of the Prokhorovka action had the effect of cancelling whatever success the 4th Panzer Army commanded in this engagement. Without Army Group Centre at least holding its positions an encirclement battle was beyond German resources, but on the four- teenth  XXIV Panzer Corps , in reserve at Belgorod, was moved by Hitler to a position to cover the newly re-created 6th Army and the 1st Panzer Army on the Mius in response to preparations for an attack that the Sovi- ets made no attempt to conceal. Hitler’s decision to reinforce the Mius position was dictated by his concern to hold the Donets industrial area, but his decision was an ex-ample of a phenomenon that was to be repeated throughout the remain-ing twenty-one months of the war—the settling of strategic policy onthe basis of economic (or political) considerations without reference to what was tactically possible. Moreover, by shifting the mobile reserve needed either to consolidate the Prokhorovka position or to exploit thesuccess that had been won there over the previous two days to the threat-ened Mius sector, Hitler unwittingly acknowledged the loss of the strate-gic initiative and began a process of chronic indecision that was to persistthroughout the remainder of 1943—and into 1944—as he tried to switch forces within and between army groups in response to crises but with no very clear view of strategic priorities across the front as a whole.
