ivisions that were literally hacked to pieces on 3 August. Thereafter the Soviets developed a rippling offensive along the length of the front in order to confuse the German high command asto the main direction of the Soviet effort and to prevent a timely andeffective German redeployment of armour for the counter-attack. In ef-fect, what the Soviet army attempted in its Belgorod–Kharkov offensiveof August 1943 was a concentrated form of its winter operations—and a foretaste of what was to be inflicted upon the Wehrmacht over a thou- sand miles of the Eastern Front from Velikiye Luki to the Black Sea for the remainder of the year. Crucially, these various efforts were to differ fundamentally in aim and execution from German offensive operations. The essence of Blitz- krieg was a single or double envelopment by armour and encirclement and annihilation by infantry: the aim was to destroy enemy field forma-tions and not, as often suggested, the paralysis of an enemy’s commandand communications systems. Though there were differences within theSoviet high command in the summer and autumn of 1943 about howoffensive operations should be conducted, what emerged was a broadfront strategy that declined deep-penetration operations, in part because of a very considerable Soviet respect for German armoured technique and in part because the Soviet army simply lacked the logistical exper-tise to mount such operations. In general terms the logistical supportavailable to a Soviet front in an offensive in the second half of 1943 wassufficient for an advance of about seventy miles, and without the meansto conduct clear-cut battles of encirclement the Stavka sought to wear down German forces by a series of attacks characterised by advances on one or two axes that would force German formations to withdraw over amuch wider operational area.  The result was to be not a series of surgicalvictories but an abrasive sequence of battles to successive river lines inwhich the Soviet army achieved
