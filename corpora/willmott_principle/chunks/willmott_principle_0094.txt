Only in the last days of October around Krivoi Rog was German armour able to gather for a counter-attack that inflicted a sharp defeat upon Soviet forces, the 5th Guards Tank Army from the 2nd UkrainianFront losing the equivalent of a tank corps in this action. But by the timethis success came the way of Army Group South its intention to develop the Dnepr as its main line of resistance had been compromised; through-out the length of the river below its junction with the Pripet, the Sovietshad crossed the Dnepr around Chernobyl on 19 September, on eitherside of Kiev on the twenty-second and around Pereyaslav, Kremenchugand Dnepropetrovsk on the twenty-sixth.

While success eluded the Soviet army in Army Group North ’s area of responsibility, other than around Nevel in early October, south of the Dvina the Soviet army recovered an area between 150 and200 miles in depth over a frontage of 650 miles by the end of September1943.
