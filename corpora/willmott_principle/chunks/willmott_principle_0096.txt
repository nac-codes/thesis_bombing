In these circum-stances the extent of German losses at Kursk assumed its full significance.By 23 August the corps strengths of the 1st Panzer Army had been re- duced to 5,800 men as a result of the Mius battle while by 7 September,at a time when the effective strength of infantry divisions seeking to gain the protection of the Dnepr was down to a thousand rifles, Army Group South had been reduced to 257  tanks and 220 assault guns, less than one- third of the establishment with which it began its drive on Kursk just two months before. In trying to piece together an effective defence of the Ukraine in the second half of 1943 the Wehrmacht was thus beset by long-term structural and leadership problems that reflected the accumulating diffi-culties of Germany as a whole as the tide of war turned against the Axispowers, but the Wehrmacht nevertheless was to benefit from two devel- opments. The teething and maintenance problems that had attended theintroduction of a new generation of tanks and assault guns into wide-spread service in the first half of the year eased with the passing of time, and the German ability in the autumn of 1943 to master the situation in Italy—at least in defensive terms—meant that after September the Italiantheatre did not siphon off German strength on the Eastern Front. In fact,before the end of 1943 as a result of the Anglo-American armies in south-ern Italy being halted south of Rome the German high command wasable to transfer forces from Italy to the Eastern Front.
