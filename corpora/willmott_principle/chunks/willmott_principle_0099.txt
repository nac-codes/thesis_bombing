For all the junior Axis powers the dilemma that Finland faced was one that they shared after mid-1943. These pow-ers had good reason to fear a German victory that would reduce them toa status little different from that of more obviously conquered and occu-pied states, but after summer 1943 these powers, particularly those thatlived alongside the Soviet Union, realised that they stood in danger of being dragged down to defeat along with a Germany that would ensure their ruination in an attempt to save herself.
