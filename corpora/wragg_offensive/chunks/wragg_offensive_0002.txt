entre around the effectiveness of the bomber and of bomber campaigns, while others debate the morality and the wisdom of the concept. Debate has not been confined to the United Kingdom and the United States but has also extended to those European countries which have come to know, by virtue of bitter experience, that even traditional warfare does not spare innocent civilians, of any age. This is not surprising, for while the civilian casualties inflicted by the bomber are nothing new to those who have experienced the horrors of war in their country, with fighting in their streets, there has always been something terrible about death and destruction from the air which has made it worse even than artillery fire, and unable to bear comparison with the bullet or the sword. Added to this has been the myth which persists to this day that somehow World War I corrupted the innocence of the early aeroplane. This is hardly fair, since the idea of attack from the air preceded the aeroplane and the airship by many centuries. Those who thought, as did the Wright brothers, that the aeroplane would bring an end to wars, did so not because they could not see a role for the aeroplane with the military but because they foresaw flight being so fundamental to future warfare that it would be the ultimate deterrent. No army could move without being observed, no one would dare start a conflict for fear of the destruction which it would bring. It took not the bomber but an awful advance in what may be inadequately described as munitions technology to bring widespread conflict to an end with the advent of first the A-bomb and then the H-bomb, the latter more usually in the form of missile warheads than bombs as such. There is another myth favoured by those seeking a soft, and politically acceptable, option. This is that economic sanctions can be an effective and humane substitute for military action. Sanctions either work or they do not, just as the bomber either succeeds or fails. If they
