I have tried to show the strengths and the failings of the bomber offensives, coming as close to the present as one can. Several points seem to me to stand out. Firstly, the bomber was born out of necessity, as seen' by those planning strategy at the time. Secondly, cost-effective it might not have been, but often it was the only way of striking back at an enemy. Thirdly, those who believed, as happened before the outbreak of World War I and during the early years of that war, that attack from the air was cowardly, had little conception of the risks involved and of the casualty rate amongst bomber aircrew during two world wars. It took a brave man to fly with the bombers, and a brave and well-matched crew to operate effectively. Finally, in the right circumstances, bombers did make a contribution to the war effort, and if they did not, it was either because of excessive optimism and subjective judgement or because campaigns were cut short too soon because of a political whim which suggested that other targets might be more expedient. Bombers, like the siege machines of medieval battle, usually took time to realize their objectives. Improvements in the performance of what once was thought of as fighter-bombers, the strike aircraft of today, have rendered the bomber obsolete, finishing the downgrading of the bomber's status, started with the German V-1 and V-2 missiles and continued by the development of the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Yet it would be premature to write off the bomber and the concept of the air raid. The United States may well have been wrong, in April 1986, to use bombers against Libya in retaliation for terrorist raids, but the wrong lay in the effect which this 15 had on even pro-Western Arab opinion, risking escalation of the conflict through reprisals; the bomber showed that it could still be effective. The other weakness of the operation was that the bomber, more than seventy years after the concept became a practical proposition
