THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 18 PROPHECY OF DESTRUCTION In 1670 a Jesuit priest, Father Francesco de Lana de Terzi, in his book Prodromo overo Saggio, proposed an aerial ship which would be kept aloft by four copper spheres, emptied of air, but he also thought that the Almighty might prevent construction of such a craft because it could destroy an enemy's fleet, killing his men and burning his ships by 'artificial fire-works and fire-balls. And this they may do not only to ships but to great buildings, castles, cities, with such severity that they which cast these things down from a height out of gun-shot, cannot on the other side be offended by those from below'. It was clear that at an early stage attack from the air was seen to hold a special terror, and that dealing out death and destruction in this way was seen as being worse than using conventional artillery. Strange too, that de Lana de Terzi also saw the 'bomber' as being invulnerable; a myth which was to cost many lives before the reality of its limitations came to be accepted. Earlier still, an illustration produced in 1326 by Walter de Milemetre depicted a windsock-shaped kite, with small wings, dropping a bomb over a besieged city. The idea of movement through the air passed out of the stage of dreams and speculation with the invention of the hot-air balloon by the French brothers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier, with a manned and untethered, or free, ascent on 21 November 1783, by François Pilâtre de Rozier and the Marquis d'Arlandes. This was followed just ten days later by a similar voyage by a hydrogen balloon, invented by another Frenchman, Jacques-Alexandre César Charles, who ascended with an associate, the elder of the Robert brothers, on 1 December 1783. In the manner of the times, the inventors' names were applied to the balloons, with a hot-air balloon becoming known as a Montgolfière and a hydr
