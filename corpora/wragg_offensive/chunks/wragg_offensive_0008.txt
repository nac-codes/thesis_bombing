the elder of the Robert brothers, on 1 December 1783. In the manner of the times, the inventors' names were applied to the balloons, with a hot-air balloon becoming known as a Montgolfière and a hydrogen balloon Charlière. It was not long before the military possibilities of the balloon were being propounded, not least by Joseph-Michel Montgolfier, who in 1793 suggested that a large Montgolfière be used to drop two bombs on Toulon, then in revolt against the new Republican rulers of France. In the first of many instances of the military shying away from the use of aerial warfare, the offer was rejected. The following year, a captive hydrogen balloon, or Charlière, L'Entreprenent, was used for artillery- spotting at the Battle of Mauberge, supposedly playing a decisive role in the victory which resulted. Balloons also appeared in this role at the Siege of Charleroi and at the Battle of Fleurus, as well as at Mayence, while Captain Jean-Marie-Joseph Coutelle became 'chef du bataillon des aérostiers de la République'. Even before the bomber was properly born, the seeds of eventual redundancy were being sown. At the turn of the eighteenth and nine- teenth centuries, Sir William Congreve brought the artillery rocket to 19 Europe, after the concept had already travelled from China to India, where Tipu Sultan's troops had used it against forces commanded by the Duke of Wellington in 1799. Successful trials in 1805 gave the Royal Navy sufficient confidence in the new weapon for it to be used against Copenhagen in 1807, apparently with considerable effect. Some years later, in 1818, Charles Rogier proposed applying Congreve rockets to unmanned balloons, using a delayed-action fuse to fire the rockets, while the balloons would also be subsequently destroyed, adding mystery to the terror of the operation. The idea that the balloon would make a bomber would not go away, in spite of the obvious limitations of lift and the inability of the balloon to go anywhere other than with
