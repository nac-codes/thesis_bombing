e terror of the operation. The idea that the balloon would make a bomber would not go away, in spite of the obvious limitations of lift and the inability of the balloon to go anywhere other than with the prevailing wind. A little more than twenty years after Rogier's proposal for rocket-firing balloons, during the 1840s, Henry Tracey Coxwell demonstrated bombing from balloons before German army officers in Berlin but again encountered resistance to this type of warfare. Undaunted, Coxwell later suggested using balloons for bombing during the Siege of Sebastopol, but the idea was rejected by the War Office. In 1862, writing in the Army and Navy Gazette, Coxwell suggested that dropping bombs from balloons would be more humane than conventional fighting, by making victory easier and more complete, while he also foresaw the use of gas and chemical weapons, although, to be fair, he was not so concerned with killing enemy soldiers as with disabling them so that they could be taken prisoner. Not everyone was opposed to the use of balloon bombers in the military establishment. During the Siege of Khartoum in 1884, the Commander of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment, General Hutchinson, wrote that a navigable balloon would be worth more than an additional 10,000 men. Not only would additional men have to be fed, a serious consideration under siege conditions, but Hutchinson argued that the Arabs, whom he admired, would also be spared by 'the realization that their camps and towns could, by chemical means, be fired in daylight by an unap- proachable enemy, and on dark nights by an invisible agent' and that this 'would create the belief that we were assisted by supernatural powers, and that Allah himself must surely befriend us'. Of course, the major flaw in this argument was that the balloon of the day was anything but navigable; it would be almost twenty years later before such ap- peared. Balloons had in fact been used operationally as bombers - in 1849 by Austrian forces be
