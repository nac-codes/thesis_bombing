Langley, whose No. 6 model actually flew for three-quarters of a mile on 28 November 1896. Not realizing that Langley's experiments failed to allow for any control of the aeroplane and were ultimately doomed to failure, in 1898 the United States War Department awarded Langley a grant of $50,000 for the construction of a man-carrying aeroplane. Langley in turn contracted Stephen M. Balzer to build a 12-hp petrol engine of not more than 100 lbs in weight, but when this could only deliver 8 hp, further development was put into the hands of one of Langley's associates, Charles Manly. Even though a quarter-scale model of the proposed aeroplane, using a 3.2-hp scaled-down Manly-Balzer engine, failed to fly during tests, Langley persisted until the model managed straight and level flight in August 1903. These early problems did not diminish Langley's confidence in his aeroplane, which he named the Aerodrome A. Yet even had he achieved easy success with his models, the portents were not good. The main problem was that Langley belonged to what has become known as the 'chauffeur' school of aeronautical pioneers; that is to say, those who  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 22 23 PROPHECY OF DESTRUCTION believed that aeroplanes could be driven rather like cars, overlooking the three-dimensional nature of flight. Another problem lay in his inten- tion to launch the aeroplane from a catapult mounted on the roof of his houseboat moored on the Potomac river. When, on 7 October 1903, Aerodrome A was launched from the houseboat, with the unfortunate Charles Manly at the controls, it fouled the launching mechanism and crashed into the river. A second attempt, on 8 December, provided a repeated performance, even to giving Manly yet another unwanted ducking. A far more promising line of research had been followed by the main rivals of Langley, the two Wright brothers, Wilbur and Orville. 'Research' was not too grand a word for their activities for, in contrast with many other pioneers, they conduct
