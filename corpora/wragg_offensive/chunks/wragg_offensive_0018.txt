subsequently rebuilt as the Nulli Secundus II, using the same engine, which was also borrowed for the British Army Aeroplane No. 1, built at Farnborough by Cody with assistance from Capper. The French Army also had an airship, of the Lebaudy type, called La Patrie, but this too was lost in a storm, and salvage was impossible since it broke away from its mooring and was last seen over Ireland, where it collided with a hilltop before disappearing over the Atlantic. A successor, La République, was ordered from the Lebaudy works. A public subscription mounted by a newspaper, the Morning Post, purchased a Lebaudy airship named after the newspaper for the British Army, and when this was delivered in 1910 it represented a significant improvement on the earlier British designed airships, although by this time other, smaller British designs, including the Baby, were entering Army service. The Royal Navy was also having problems with its early airships. Naval Airship No. 1, also named appropriately enough Mayfly, was found to be overweight, and lightening of the structure simply weakened it to the point of collapse, without its ever taking to the air ! The French were also the first export customer for a Wright aeroplane, with Etienne, Minister for War, offering the brothers 600,000 francs (£24,000 at the then prevailing rates of exchange) for a Wright B aero- plane. On the other hand, French superiority in airship construction was confirmed by the sales of a Lebaudy airship to the Russian Army. Yet, at this early stage, the Lebaudy concern already seemed to be at its zenith of achievement, and it was soon to prove unable to match the more aggressive von Zeppelin, who formed a limited liability com- pany in September 1908 and had orders from customers in Germany, with four craft ordered by the Imperial German Navy, and from abroad. A portent of another, more serious aspect to military aerostation was already being experienced by the French, with public opinion alarmed at the
