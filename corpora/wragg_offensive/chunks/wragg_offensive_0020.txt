, the interest being shown by the major armies in aviation was being matched by many navies, and especially by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy. The distinction of making the first flight from a ship belongs to the United States Navy, with Lieutenant Eugene Ely making a flight from a platform constructed over the forecastle of the light cruiser uss Birmingham on 14 November 1910, flying a Curtiss biplane. Later he was also to make the first landing aboard a ship, flying from the shore to land on a platform constructed  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 26 PROPHECY OF DESTRUCTION over the stern of the cruiser uss Pennsylvania, on 18 January 1911; after lunch aboard the ship as she lay at anchor in San Francisco Bay, he took off again, giving him the added distinction of making the first round trip from the shore to a ship and back. The first flight from a British warship was not until 10 January 1912, when Lieutenant Charles Rumney Samson RN, flying a Short S.27 biplane, took off from a platform constructed over the forecastle of the battleship HMS Africa, as she lay at anchor off Sheerness. In May that year Samson gave the Royal Navy the notable achievement of making the first flight from a ship underway, taking off from another battleship, HMS Hibernia, as she steamed at 101/2 knots into the wind in Weymouth Bay, at the end of the annual Royal Naval Review. The Review had been a success for British naval aviators. Four aircraft had been taken to Portland, a Deperdussin, a Nieuport and two Short biplanes, one of which was used by Samson for his flight from HMS Hibernia. Flying had started with Samson flying over the fleet in one of the Short S.27 biplanes, which he had converted into a makeshift sea- plane with the addition of three torpedo-shaped floats, and nicknamed HMS Amphibian. During the review, one of his fellow officers, Lieutenant Gray, gave a demonstration of bombing, dropping a 300-lb bomb at 500 feet, before diving towards a submarine which he had spotted a
