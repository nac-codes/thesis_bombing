rlier favouring airship development at the expense of the aeroplane (which had seen the Committee on Imperial Defence in 1909 decide to stop spending the paltry sum of £2,000 a year on aeroplane construction at Farnborough in favour of spending £45,000 on airship construction and development), the Army Balloon Factory at Farnborough finally became the Army Aircraft Factory. The Balloon Section of the Royal Engineers had become the Air Battalion in 1911, and on 13 May 1912, the British formed the Royal Flying Corps; officially part of the Army, it included an Army Wing, a Navy Wing and a Central Flying School for officers and men of both services. In spite of the creation of a joint air arm, the attitudes of naval and army aviators differed. The Army saw the aeroplane as an extension of ground forces, and completely subjugated to their tactical needs, with an emphasis on reconnaissance, and later on ground attack with some localized air defence. The Royal Navy regarded the aeroplane as a strategic weapon, with an undoubted reconnaissance  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 28 2 role but with other duties as well, which would mean that in the coming war it would be the Royal Navy which would provide air defence of the United Kingdom and mount the first heavy bombing raids. It was perhaps not surprising that at the beginning of July 1914 control of naval flying in the United Kingdom reverted to the Royal Navy, with the formation of the Royal Naval Air Service, leaving the RFC as the British Army's own air arm. The new RNAS, ably supported by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, started life with the then not inconsiderable total of fifty-two seaplanes and flying-boats, thirty-nine landplanes and seven airships. Only two of the aeroplanes and one of the airships were fitted with machine-guns, while bombs consisted of shells fitted with guiding fins. At first, air defence of the United Kingdom was to be the priority for the Royal Naval Air Service, and unlike the Royal
