246 aircraft. Most of the aircraft operated by the still embryonic air arms of both sides were unsuitable for combat, and many were barely suitable for training, not least because, during the last couple of years before the war, aircraft had quickly moved from the ungainly machines of the Wrights and their licensees to something clearly recognizable as the classic biplane, and some heavily wired and braced monoplanes. As so often happens, the armed forces were waiting for 'modern' aeroplanes to be delivered! As for bombs, these also existed, again only in limited numbers, with the British, for example, having just twenty-six bombs of 20 lbs apiece! The small size of the bombs should cause little surprise, since the aircraft were also small and capable of lifting only limited loads, but the number of bombs available is less easy to understand. Essentially, these early bombs were small artillery shells fitted with stabilizing fins, which was perhaps appropriate, since even the enlightened army commanders who did not object to aeroplanes spoiling the war usually viewed it as no more than a form of long-distance artillery. Only the naval commanders seemed to appreciate the value of the aeroplane for a strategic role. In addition to finding a role for itself as a bomber force, the RNAS was volunteered by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, to undertake air defence of the United Kingdom. This was a duty which was to stretch its abilities and the early fighter aeroplane to the full. By contrast, the British Commander-in-Chief in France, Earl Haig, was unable to see the aeroplane even in the reconnaissance role. Depending on one's viewpoint, the Germans take either the credit or the blame for initiating aerial bombardments. On 6 August 1914 the Zeppelin Z-6 dropped thirteen bombs in a raid against one of the forts defending the Belgian town of Li√®ge; none of the bombs struck the fort, but nine civilians were killed. If this was a portent of the difficulties
