elins were to become fair game for fighter aircraft - or for the 'fighting scouts' as they were at first known. It was to be some time before one of these giant craft could be destroyed in the air, since on jettisoning their ballast the Zeppelin could easily outclimb the early aeroplane, and seaplanes and small flying-boats in particular found difficulty in climbing above the Zeppelin through a hail of defensive gun-fire in order to get themselves into the ideal position for an attack. The solution was seen to lie in pre-emptive strikes against the Zeppelin bases in Germany. The RNAS had quickly established a base in Belgium after war broke out, operating from just outside Antwerp. On 22 September 1914 a flight of four Sopwith Tabloid biplanes from Antwerp attacked the Zeppelin sheds at Cologne and Düsseldorf, flying in low cloud and, perhaps because of this, enjoying little or no success. The Tabloid, small even by the standards of the day, was far from being the ideal bomber, but it had enjoyed the distinction of winning the last Schneider Trophy contest before the war. The limi- tations of the Tabloid did not prevent the RNAS trying again, and early in October another formation of Tabloids from Antwerp mounted another 'raid' on Düsseldorf and Cologne, attacking airships at both centres as well as the main railway station at Cologne, although this was a target of opportunity for a Tabloid pilot who came out of low cloud to find a railway station below his aircraft rather than the hoped-for airship shed! One of the victims of the attack was the Zeppelin Z-9, destroyed in its shed at Cologne, where it had been attacked by Flight Lieutenant  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 32 33 THE BLOODY PARALYSER! Marix of the RNAS with just two 20-lb bombs. Another raid was mounted by the RNAS against these sheds in November. Encouraged by this early success, other raids were planned. Certainly it was cost-effective to use a handful or so of small biplanes against what were in effect major
