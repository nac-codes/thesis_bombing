against these sheds in November. Encouraged by this early success, other raids were planned. Certainly it was cost-effective to use a handful or so of small biplanes against what were in effect major German air stations, with the destruction of what would then have been a significant proportion of their bombing capa- bility, and it compared favourably with many later raids in both wars, with larger aircraft, bigger and more effective bombs and better tech- nology. A flight of four Avro 504 biplanes, which were later to be relegated by the RNAS to training duties, were fitted out in the UK with one of the earliest mechanical bomb releases, each capable of holding four 20-lb bombs. The aircraft were then, in the interests of secrecy, and perhaps to make sure they arrived safely at their destination, dismantled and transported by road and sea to Belfort in the east of France, close to the border with Germany. On 17 November 1914 these aircraft flew more than 200 miles from their base to Friedrichshafen, on Lake Constance, where they destroyed Zeppelin L-7 of the German Naval Air Service in its shed and also several workshops as well as a hydrogen-generating plant, so disrupting production at the Zeppelin works. The real long-term value to the Allied war effort lay not so much in the damage done (although again this was considerable for the forces deployed, and the loss of a single airship was still painful to Germany at this early stage) but in the resultant move of 4,000 German troops and artillery to provide anti-aircraft cover for the Zeppelin works. Yet these successes in the air did not prevent the Allies losing ground to the German advance, and by the end of 1914 the RNAS had to move out of its Belgian bases, leaving just a small part of that tiny country unoccupied by the Germans. The RNAS established a new forward base at Dunkirk in northern France, while the victorious Germans established a chain of seaplane bases which stretched from Ostend to the Frisian Isl
