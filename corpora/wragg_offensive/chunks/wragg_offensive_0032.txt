gets were not to be adhered to for long, but in fairness they were also impractical. Navigation and bomb-aiming techniques were still primitive, and the safety of civilians miles away from military objectives could not be guaranteed, with the best will in the world. Escalation was to take place from this time on, as both sides became more confident of their ability to exploit air power for strategic purposes. The architect of the abortive Cuxhaven raid, Murray Sueter, head of the Admiralty's Air Department, visited Sir Frederick Handley Page, founder of the aircraft manufacturers of that name, and asked him to design a 'bloody paralyser of an aeroplane'. Sir Frederick, who had long believed in the possibilities of the aeroplane for strategic bombing, scaled up an idea already on the drawing-board to produce what was eventually to become the 0/100 heavy bomber. A difference not so much of strategy but of approach was to emerge from this time on between the Germans, who placed a greater reliance on airships than on bombers, although they too were to produce large bomber aeroplanes, and the British and French, who gave the aeroplane a higher priority than the airship, not withstanding the work of Willows in Britain and the Lebaudy brothers in France. There was some logic in the German attitude given the 'state of the art' at the time, since an airship could remain aloft for up to thirty hours at 10,000 feet and, by jettisoning ballast and if necessary bombs as well, could outclimb most fighters, especially the seaplane and flying-boat fighters so often used by the Royal Naval Air Service. Attacking an airship even if it could fly at only about 50 mph, was no easy task: the fighter (or 'fighting scout' as these were first known) would have to climb through the airship's defensive machine-gun and sometimes accurate rifle fire as well, before moving into a position above the airship from which the envelope could be raked with machine-gun fire and the explosive hydrogen ga
