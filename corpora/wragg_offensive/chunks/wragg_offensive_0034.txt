deployed on these missions, and their warload, was so limited that the success which was obtained was surprising and might best be seen as a result of still inadequate anti-aircraft defences and the lack of control and co-ordination of fighter defences, something which was not to happen until World War II. Even the raid of 7 May 1915 on the Zeppelin sheds at Evere and Berchem St-Agathe in German-occupied Belgium saw only four aircraft used by the RNAS, but two out of the three airships caught on the ground were destroyed! Clearly the airship, with its large size and its explosive envelope, was also an easy target once on the ground. The Germans were not sitting quietly while the RNAS was so active In spite of the problems of navigation, especially during the winter months, on 19 January 1915 the three naval airships L-3, L-4 and L-6 under the command of Peter Strasser himself in L-6, set out from their base at Fuhlsbuttel, near Hamburg, to bomb targets in Britain. Engine trouble soon forced L-6 to return to base, but the two remaining airships crossed the English coast at 20.00 - in poor weather but aided by the absence of any black-out. High winds had swept the two airships to a landfall some eighty miles south of their intended landfall, the mouth of the River Humber and the ports of Hull and Grimsby. Instead, L-3 and L-4 found themselves over Norfolk. L-3 flew at 5,000 feet through snow showers to bomb Great Yarmouth, arriving over the port at 20.30 and dropping several 110-lb bombs, which hit civilian houses, killing two and injuring several more. The other airship, L-4, followed the railway line to Heacham, dropping a single 110-lb bomb over this small coastal village, but this fell onto open ground and exploded harmlessly. The airship then flew over Sandringham to bomb King's Lynn, arriving there at 23.00, but the raid on this port also caught the civilian population rather than the military or the commercial docks, with a row of cottages demolished, the loss
