bomb King's Lynn, arriving there at 23.00, but the raid on this port also caught the civilian population rather than the military or the commercial docks, with a row of cottages demolished, the loss of three civilian lives and injury to twelve others. Ironically, in view of the Kaiser's concern for the welfare of the British royal family, King George V had been in residence at Sandringham at the time L-4 passed overhead. One outcome of this first raid was the introduction of a black-out. The black-out reduced the effectiveness of the Zeppelin raids, but throughout the spring and summer of 1915 there were many raids by Zeppelins, with bombs falling on Lowestoft, Bury St Edmunds, Ipswich, Malden and, after the beginning of June, London. The worst raid of the war, however, came on the night of 6-7 June, when sixty-four people were killed when Zeppelins bombed Kingston-upon-Hull, the major port on the Humber. Churchill intensified his efforts to ensure that the RNAS was equipped with the aircraft and manpower to maintain and strengthen the air defence of the United Kingdom. He also realized that anti-aircraft fire, even with the assistance of searchlights, was less effective against the Zeppelins than fighter attack, even though the airships were large and slow-moving targets. Possibly World War II standard anti-aircraft guns and gunners would have found the airship easy prey, but in World War I anti-aircraft protection was by definition based on machine-gun fire and adapted light field artillery. The following morning the RNAS mounted the successful raid against the Zeppelin bases at Evere and Berchem St-Agathe, near Bruges, with aircraft of No. 1 squadron operating from Dunkirk. 7 June was to be an eventful day for the RNAS and for their opponents. Three German Army airships had taken off from their base early in the day to bomb London, but all three craft, LZ-37, LZ-38 and LZ-39, were forced by engine trouble to return to their base near Bruges. LZ-37 was sighted ov
