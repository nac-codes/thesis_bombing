within a few months of war breaking out. been recognized that it was not sufficient to shoot down an opponent's aircraft or airships: the factories which produced them, and the bases which they used, had to be destroyed as well, as shown by the raids on Cologne, DÃ¼sseldorf and Friedrichshafen during the autumn of 1914 The rudiments of strategic air power were already in existence by January 1915. The Royal Naval Air Service mounted further raids on Cuxhaven, this time from its forward base at Dunkirk, early in 1915, although no great weight of bombs could be brought to bear on the target. The number of aircraft deployed on these missions, and their warload, was so limited that the success which was obtained was surprising and might best be seen as a result of still inadequate anti-aircraft defences and the lack of control and co-ordination of fighter defences, something which was not to happen until World War II. Even the raid of 7 May 1915 on the Zeppelin sheds at Evere and Berchem St-Agathe in German-occupied Belgium saw only four aircraft used by the RNAS, but two out of the three airships caught on the ground were destroyed! Clearly the airship, with its large size and its explosive envelope, was also an easy target once on the ground. The Germans were not sitting quietly while the RNAS was so active. In spite of the problems of navigation, especially during the winter months, on 19 January 1915 the three naval airships L-3, L-4 and L-6 under the command of Peter Strasser himself in L-6, set out from their base at Fuhlsbuttel, near Hamburg, to bomb targets in Britain. Engine trouble soon forced L-6 to return to base, but the two remaining airships crossed the English coast at 20.00 - in poor weather but aided by the absence of any black-out. High winds had swept the two airships to a landfall some eighty miles south of their intended landfall, the mouth of the River Humber and the ports of Hull and Grimsby. Instead, L-3 and L-4 found themselves over Norfolk. L-
