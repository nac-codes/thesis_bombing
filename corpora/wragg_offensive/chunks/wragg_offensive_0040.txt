E WEAPON 36 THE BLOODY PARALYSER! first successful shooting-down of an airship by a fighter aircraft, and Warneford became the first member of the RNAS to receive the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest award for valour. Unfortunately he died in action ten days later. The need to kill airships quickly became paramount. In 1916 Com- mander Rankin of the Royal Naval Air Service experimented with firing rockets at airships. That same year, experiments were made with fitting aircraft to airships, so that these could be kept on station and then launched to intercept an intruder. On 21 February 1916 Lieutenant- Commander de Courcy Ireland and Commander Usborne, both of the RNAS, were killed in an early experiment which combined a Royal Aircraft Factory BE2a fighter and an SS airship, following an unsatisfac- tory trial with the same combination the previous August by Flight Commander W. C. Hicks RNAS. The SS airship used by de Courcy Ireland and Usborne rose too quickly, and a sudden loss of envelope pressure led to the failure of the front locking device holding their aircraft, and the shearing of the rear locking device, the sudden jerk damaging the controls as the aircraft fell away from the airship, throwing de Courcy Ireland out, while Usborne was killed when the aircraft crashed into Strood railway sidings. It was not until two years later that success was achieved using a British-built Zeppelin-type airship, the R-23, and a Sopwith Camel fighter, with a new release mechanism known as the Little-Crook system after its inventors, Major I. C. Little and Captain Crook, both of the Royal Flying Corps. Several unmanned launches preceded a test flight by Lieutenant R. E. Keys RNAS, but in spite of the success of this apparatus the system arrived too late to enter production, and in any event, aircraft performance was already showing sufficient improvement for fighters to be a real match for the airship. Action by the RNAS was not confined to the Western and Home Fronts. In
