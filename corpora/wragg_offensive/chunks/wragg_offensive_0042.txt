wus Selim and the other ship, the cruiser Breslau, becoming the Midilli. The aerial attack intensified after the Goeben/Sultan Jawus Selim, ran aground, pre- senting what should have been an easy target, except that the still primitive bombs had little effect on the warship's heavy armour plating. Had the Breslau run aground instead, the outcome might have been different. Elsewhere in the Middle East, British aircraft created havoc amongst retreating Turkish troops during the closing stages of the campaign in Mesopotamia. This steady development of the role of the RNAS into an instrument of strategic air power did not always find a smooth course, however, since not all senior naval officers shared Churchill's and the RNAS's own, view of the capabilities of air power. During the summer of 1916 the units based on Dunkirk came under the command of the Vice-Admiral, Dover Patrol, who felt that air power had to be subservient to the needs of naval and ground commanders. A wider role was not appreciated. Perhaps it was a sign of just how matters were moving in the air that before long, in late autumn, the Dunkirk squadrons found themselves freed from the Vice-Admiral's command. The Royal Flying Corps was also being encouraged to take a broader role by this time. By late 1914, Army commanders were being alerted to the fact that RFC aircraft were often missing valuable targets of opportunity, and the instruction was given that reconnaissance aircraft should always carry bombs, to be used whenever a suitable target appeared. To be fair, the role was still perceived as a tactical one, a limitation effectively imposed on the RFC by the extent of its reconnais- sance operations and by the fact that at first targets were always a matter of chance rather than the outcome of a carefully planned and conceived strategic strike. Nevertheless, by the following spring the Battle of Neuve-Chapelle, which started on 10 March, included a plan for tactical bombing, intended to disrupt the
