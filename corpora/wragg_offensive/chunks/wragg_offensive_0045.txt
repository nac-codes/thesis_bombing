d in March 1917, with the first British heavy bombers, the Handley Page 0/100, a biplane with twin Rolls-Royce Eagle engines of 250 hp each, capable of carrying up to sixteen 112-1b bombs. This was used for a number of night raids against German industrial centres before this offensive was ended and No. 3 Wing was transferred to Dunkirk, in readiness for the Wing's disbandment and the transfer of its aircraft to other RNAS units, ready for a campaign of raids against German airfields. The torpedoing of two British hospital ships, the Gloucester Castle and the Asturias, led to a delay in the run-down of No. 3 Wing as twenty-five aircraft from the Wing and fifteen from their French comrades were sent on a raid on the German city of Freiburg. By July 1917 the RFC had taken over most of the airborne operations in France from the RNAS, which was freed to concentrate further on the development of its sea-going role and on the creation of a strong maritime-reconnaissance force using the Felixstowe series of flying- boats. During the final stages of its operations in France, the RNAS assisted the RFC in a series of raids against German airfields, which the RFC's commander in France, the then Colonel Trenchard, preferred to strategic raids as such, in an attempt to achieve aerial superiority over the Western Front, thus allowing the ground attack units to operate effectively. This was seen as the pre-requisite to a push against German land forces and as a higher priority than raids on German industrial centres. More than twenty years later the Luftwaffe was to initiate a campaign of raids against British airfields, especially those in the south and east of England, as a first step before the invasion of Britain and attacks on British industrial centres. The logic was sound up to a point, except that effective bombing of major industrial targets and centres of communications was also important. The truth was that there were insufficient numbers of aircraft available to fight
