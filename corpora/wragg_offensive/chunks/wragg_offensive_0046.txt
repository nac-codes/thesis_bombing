a point, except that effective bombing of major industrial targets and centres of communications was also important. The truth was that there were insufficient numbers of aircraft available to fight the war in the air effectively, and that the technology of the day was also not up to the expectations of those who believed that air power could cure all military and strategic problems, not the least of these being the bloody stalemate on the Western Front. In contrast with World War II, the entry of the United States into World War I did little to help the war in the air, with the first American units arriving without aircraft of their own. The American aircraft industry was short of components, and especially of good engines until the introduction of the Liberty engine, leaving the United States Army and Navy hugely dependent on the arrival of French and British designs. Eventually the United States Army in France operated light bombers before the war ended; these were commanded by Brigadier-General William 'Billy' Mitchell.

Even heavy artillery fire was preferred by soldiers to bombing, and this in spite of the fact that, in World War I at least, artillery fire was far more accurate, more concentrated and more devastating than any bombing campaign of the day could be. The lack of adequate anti-aircraft weapons undoubtedly contributed to the feeling of helplessness, and although it was soon clear to the bomber commanders that fighter escorts were necessary for the success of their missions, to thos
