t weapons undoubtedly contributed to the feeling of helplessness, and although it was soon clear to the bomber commanders that fighter escorts were necessary for the success of their missions, to those watching on the ground below, bombers - and in particular the airships - seemed almost invulnerable. Most of all, it must be remembered that at the outset of the war the aeroplane was a novelty to most people - indeed, many of those going off to the war had rarely if ever seen an aeroplane or an airship. There was no training of troops in coping with a determined aerial attack, and even in the fighting on the ground the training was for a means of warfare long since past. The tank, the machine-gun, the use of gas were all factors for which the troops were completely unprepared. The air raids on British towns had developed throughout 1915 and 1916. On the night of 13-14 October 1915, five airships from the German Naval Air Service crossed the North Sea, raiding towns and cities as far west as Guildford, dropping 102 explosive bombs and 87 incendiary devices, killing 71 people and injuring another 128. As the number of raids built up, almost a year later no fewer than nine Zeppelins raided London on the night of 23-24 September. Three of the Zeppelins on this raid, L-31, L-32 and L-33, were of the latest type, with a gasbag of 2 million cubic feet capacity. Substantial damage was done in this raid. especially in the City. A few days later, on the night of 1-2 October 1916. eleven Zeppelins raided London, but one of them, L-31 commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant Mathy, was shot down by a Be2c fighter and crashed in flames at Potters Bar, with the loss of all aboard. Mathy had com- manded an earlier type of airship, L-13, on the raid of 13 October 1915 and doubtless would have been involved in other raids as well, since throughout the war no fewer than eighty-eight German naval and military airships were involved in fifty-one raids on British towns and cities, dropping 200 tons
