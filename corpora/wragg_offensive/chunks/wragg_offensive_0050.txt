At first the German heavy bombers had everything much their own way and were able to cross the English coast and bomb towns in the south, and even London itself, and be away before fighter aircraft could be scrambled and climb to the 15,000-feet altitude favoured by the bombers. In complete contrast to later battles in the air, altitude offered the bombers safety. The larger German heavy bombers were equipped with six machine-guns for defence against fighters. The heavy bombers mounted major raids once every two weeks; they were augmented by hit-and-run raids by seaplanes from the German Naval Air Service which flew from their bases in Belgium and even further north, to attack towns on the east coast and in Kent. It was not until August 1917 that the fighter defences were able to counter the raids, with RNAS and RFC fighters waiting for the Gothas to arrive over their target, so that on 22 August three Gothas were shot down, and by September daylight raids became a thing of the past, with the Gothas switching to night bombing. aided by the first operational units with the R. VI. Between May 1917 and May 1918, almost three hundred Gotha G.IVs and thirty Staaken R. VIs mounted eight daylight and nineteen night raids against English targets. More than a hundred tons of bombs and a substantial quantity of incendiary devices were dropped, for the loss of a growing number of aircraft. Even so, the casualty rates on the ground were not to be taken lightly, with more than 800 people killed, mostly civilians, and almost 2,000 injured. Against this, the loss of sixty bombers, only forty per cent of them to anti-aircraft and fighter defences, the remainder in landing and other accidents, must have seemed light.
