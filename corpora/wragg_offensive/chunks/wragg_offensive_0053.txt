The South African General Smuts was asked by the British Government to head a committee to review the air defence of the United Kingdom. This was the least important of the committee's recommendations, which was simply a re-organization of the anti-aircraft and fighter defences of the UK, with greater emphasis on early warning.

There was little delay in implementing the committee's recommendations, with the result that the Royal Air Force was created on 1 April 1918, from the amalgamation of the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service For a time at least, the new service, under the command of the then General Lord Trenchard, was to control and co-ordinate all British service flying.
