portance, with ten of the eighty-six RFC squadrons in France having been designated by the Army Council as long-range bombing units. The RNAS, which had been using its 0/100 bombers on long-range maritime-reconnaissance over the North Sea, found these pulled back to France to help in the war effort before the RAF was created, while at the beginning of 1918 the more powerful 0/400 bomber from Handley Page was also working up to combat readiness. Even better was to come, with the four-engined Handley Page V/1500 bomber, which started to enter RAF service during the closing months of the war. Within the RAF in France, an Independent Air Force was created under the command of Lord Trenchard, detached from the main body of the RAF and given the directive to carry the air war into Germany. A number of Aviation Militaire squadrons operated with the Independent Air Force. The nucleus of the Independent Air Force was the squadron of 0/400 bombers, and during the summer of 1918 these aircraft raided Frankfurt, Cologne and other major German cities by night. The 0/400 held the distinction of carrying the largest bombs to be dropped operationally during the war, each of 1,650 lbs, and aircraft so equipped, plus the new Handley Page V/1500s with their four 375-hp Rolls-Royce Eagle engines, were bombed up and preparing to take off for Germany, including Berlin, on the morning of 11 November 1918 when the fighting finally stopped. The V/1500s, with their theoretical maximum bombload of up to thirty 230-lb bombs, marked a considerable advance over the half-a-dozen 20-lb bombs which had comprised a typical warload four years earlier. Nor did they comprise the entire bombing strength of the RAF for, in addition to the earlier 0/400s, many 0/100s remained in service, while lighter bombers included the de Havilland-designed Airco DH4a and DH9 single-engined bombers, which were to form the back- 45 bone of many fledgling commercial airlines in the post-war world. Better was to come, for
