included the de Havilland-designed Airco DH4a and DH9 single-engined bombers, which were to form the back- 45 bone of many fledgling commercial airlines in the post-war world. Better was to come, for had the war lasted much longer, the versatile Vickers Vimy heavy bomber would have entered service, but this aeroplane was to gain fame in many other areas of the world rather than simply the Western Front or the bombing offensive over Germany. The war had opened with bombing raids by naval aircraft occurring within a few short months after the outbreak of hostilities. Before it closed, aircraft operating from warships, but by now themselves part of the new Royal Air Force, were also to be deployed on bombing raids. The battle-cruiser HMS Furious had been converted to become the world's first aircraft-carrier, with a landing-on deck aft and a flying-off deck forward; in the course of several major refits this ship was eventually to emerge as the first warship with a through-flight deck, although, as an interim measure, the flight divided around either side of the superstruc- ture and smokestack. In this form, HMS Furious (a true aircraft-carrier and, unlike the earlier seaplane-carriers, well able to match the fastest ships in the fleet with the ability to steam at 32.5 knots and carry up to twenty aircraft) launched the first successful attack from an aircraft- carrier. On 19 July 1918 seven Sopwith Camels were launched from HMS Furious for a raid against the airship sheds at Tondern in northern Germany, destroying the airships L-54 and L-60. One of the last German airships to be destroyed in the air in World War I also fell to a Sopwith Camel of the RNAS, in this case the aircraft was launched from a lighter towed by a destroyer on 18 August, when Lieutenant S. D. Culley took off to shoot down L-53, before landing in the sea alongside his towing destroyer, HMS Redoubtable, which salvaged his aircraft and also rescued Culley.
