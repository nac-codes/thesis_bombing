took off to shoot down L-53, before landing in the sea alongside his towing destroyer, HMS Redoubtable, which salvaged his aircraft and also rescued Culley. At the end of World War I on 11 November 1918, the Royal Air Force had 22,650 aircraft in 200 squadrons and 360,000 officers and men. The Aviation Militaire, overtaken in size by the RAF, had almost 4,000 aircraft, including nearly 500 bombers, accounting for thirty-two out of 255 squadrons. Fifteen squadrons operated 225 Breguet 14-day bombers, while the remaining seventeen night bomber squadrons operated 254 Voisins, Capronis and Farman F-50s. After the collapse of German resistance, more than 15,000 aircraft were to be surrendered to the Allies. The bomber had by the end of World War I become an instrument of modern warfare. It had not always been used well. Many of the earlier raids by aircraft ill-suited to the role had been more cost-effective than later raids by formations of purpose-built bombers. Most of the action had taken place over England, France and Germany, as well as Belgium, and along the Western Front, although there had been raids on other zones. The Russian Revolution in 1917 and the poverty of Russia had prevented the Russians developing a bomber offensive to parallel that of Britain and France against Germany. The Ilya Mourametz, the so-called  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 46 'airbus' of pre-war days, had entered service as a bomber with the Imperial Russian Flying Corps, which received seventy-two of these aircraft. A number of successful raids had been carried out, including one on 15 February 1915, when a single aircraft from the EVK (Eskadrilya Vozdushnykh Korablei, squadron of aerial ships), based near the front line in Poland, dropped more than 500 lbs of bombs on forces outside Plotsk. This also became one of the first bomber types to receive a defensive armament in the tail. As Russian forces retreated towards the end of the war, just one Ilya Mourametz pinned down a German artillery batt
