so became one of the first bomber types to receive a defensive armament in the tail. As Russian forces retreated towards the end of the war, just one Ilya Mourametz pinned down a German artillery battery near Novogeorgievsk for five hours, dropping 200 bombs and enabling Russian units to escape. Most of these aircraft were built under licence from Igor Sikorsky by the Russo-Baltic Company. In spite of the loyalty to the Tsar of the Imperial Russian Flying Corps, deterioration during the revolution was so fast that many units were overwhelmed by revolutionary units, which appropriated their aircraft. The few notable incidents mentioned here, and some others, were the exception to the primarily reconnaissance-orientated role of the Russian war effort in the air, all of which was concentrated on the period before and during the revolution; afterwards the revolutionaries signed an armistice with Germany. For the bomber, and for many air forces, but especially the RAF, the end of World War I marked a beginning. 3 Living with Air Power World War I had forced a change of outlook on a normally conservative military establishment, and on politicians as well. In the United Kingdom the politicians forced many of the changes on the military, most notably by recognizing the strategic value of the aeroplane and creating an autonomous Royal Air Force. Well before this, Winston Churchill had volunteered the Royal Naval Air Service for the air defence of the United Kingdom, having been an enthusiastic supporter of the aeroplane for several years before the outbreak of war.
