of the military structure so that, instead of being tied to the army and navy, air power could be deployed, with fighters and bombers waging a war of their own in an autonomous air force? If commanders of surface forces were to be denied control of air power, could they appreciate its importance? The truth was that the technology of the day was still too limited to show the bomber at its most effective, and the bombs them- selves were small and unreliable, even if they did land close to the target. To some extent, the same applied to fighter defences and anti-aircraft weapons. In no theatre of war were there enough aircraft of the right type to handle all of the tasks assigned to them, and bombing raids in particular were handled by too few aircraft. Because of technical inadequacy, including poor reliability as much as limited performance, insufficient numbers and adverse weather conditions, raids were not followed up, which allowed rebuilding and a restoration of production. The effect of bombing on civilians was only partially understood. It did create terror and anxiety, and this was appreciated, but the cumulative effect of night after night of heavy bombing, with daylight raids in between, was not understood. Did bombing affect morale or simply instil a desire for revenge? Was repeated aerial attack a lesser evil than surrender, or did most of the victims simply believe that death or serious injury would only happen to someone else? Even amongst the leading strategists, there were conflicting beliefs. The Italian General Douhet believed that air power could be an end in itself. In the United States, Mitchell also took this view. In Britain, Liddell Hart believed that close co-ordination between ground forces and air power in a highly mechanized war was the ideal. While the Royal Air Force had come into existence relatively painlessly, this was not to be the case elsewhere. In the United States and in Italy, controversy raged over the future of military aviati
