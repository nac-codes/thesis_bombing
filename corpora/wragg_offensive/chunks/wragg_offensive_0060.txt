While the Royal Air Force had come into existence relatively painlessly, this was not to be the case elsewhere. In the United States and in Italy, controversy raged over the future of military aviation and in particular on the prospect of an autonomous air arm. The French fudged the issue, taking their time, but in doing so managed to avoid making some of the mistakes made by the British and to be repeated by the Germans. The main proponent of the bomber in the United States was Brigadier- General William 'Billy' Mitchell, who had commanded the United States Army Air Service units in France during the final years of World War I.

To some extent he had succeeded, and while Martin MB bombers were not immediately available, the United States 49 had purchased some Airco DH4s and Handley Page 0/400s. These aircraft were also to be produced under licence in the United States after the war ended. Mitchell was not simply a 'bomber man' but took a broader and more far-sighted view of air power. The Armistice intervened before he could progress far in his plan to prepare an airborne division for a paratroop assault on the German-held city of Metz.

Mitchell almost immediately upset the United States Navy by his insistence on an autonomous air force and by pressing for the
