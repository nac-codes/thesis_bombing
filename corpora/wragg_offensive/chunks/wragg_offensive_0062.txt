project of his had been the development of a large strategic bomber, the XNBL-1 or 'experimental bomber, long-range', which was an un- gainly triplane with a wingspan of 120 feet and using six Liberty engines. The aircraft was intended to lift a warload of 5,000 lbs, and if it had been successful in this, it would have bettered many aircraft of later years, but it was only possible to get such a load airborne for a range of 100 miles, clearly quite useless for a strategic bomber. There were other technical short-comings as well. In the end, the project was scrapped  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 50 LIVING WITH AIR POWER not long after its first flights in 1923 and having earned the nickname Mitchell's Folly. Mitchell departed on a tour of inspection of US Army Air Service units in the Pacific, although during this time, and on his return, he continued to criticize both the United States Navy and the United States Govern- ment for inefficiency and indifference; his strident criticisms, abetted by a talent for showmanship, were not well received. In 1925 Mitchell was court-martialled for insubordination and suspended from active service for five years; he resigned the following year. The controversy continued. both inside the court room during Mitchell's court-martial and outside it, with the Lampert Committee reporting during the court-martial in favour of an autonomous air force as one of three services reporting to a combined Ministry of Defence, foreshadowing the Pentagon of later years. Instead, the United States Government accepted the recommen- dations of the Morrow Board, creating a United States Army Air Corps with its own representative on the US Army's General Staff - an en- hanced status but far short of Mitchell's ambitions for American military aviation. The USAAC came into being on 2 July 1926. To what extent Mitchell helped towards the enhancement of military aviation's standing in the US Army, and to what extent his actions had the opposite effect by forcing
