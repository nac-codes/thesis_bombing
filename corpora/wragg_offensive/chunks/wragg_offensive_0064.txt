Within the Defence Ministry, the Reichswehr Ministerium, several officers were allocated tasks which enabled them to keep in touch with developments in military aviation, and to prepare plans for the eventual return of a German aviation service. These officers included such future Luftwaffe leaders as Wever and von Kesselring. In 1923 von Seeckt himself issued a policy document which declared that a future air force would be independent of the two traditional armed forces. There were a few in the United Kingdom who still opposed the concept of a unified and autonomous air arm, including Bonar Law, the Prime Minister.
