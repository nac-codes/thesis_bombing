During the first five years of peace, the mainstay of the bomber element was the DH4B, many of which were built under licence by Boeing, as well as some 0/400s and Martin MB-1s, later joined by the more powerful MB-2. The war had seen such changes in combat, on the ground as well as in the air, that it
