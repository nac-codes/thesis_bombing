in Europe for at least ten years. That may have seemed reasonable at the time but the ten-year period was forever being pushed forward, and during the early 1930s few envisaged a war with Germany. The widespread belief in this ten-year period of grace was such that it justified many delays in im- plementing the fifty-two squadron plan. By 1925 the RAF had grown to just twenty-five squadrons. The plan was then delayed further by an acute economic crisis and the indifference of a Labour Government under Ramsay MacDonald in 1929, which meant that even by 1932 the RAF had just forty-two squadrons. 53 The vitality of the British aircraft industry and a fortunate choice of new aircraft, albeit in small numbers, enabled the RAF to remain abreast of developments elsewhere. Meanwhile the Aviation Militaire had obtained an additional night bomber regiment, with day bomber regiments based at Metz and Neu- stadt, and night bomber regiments at Nancy and Chartres. A step was taken in the foundation of an autonomous air force in December 1927 with the creation of an Air Ministry, which controlled the activities of the Aviation Militaire, even though for the time being this remained a part of the Army; certain naval aviation units were also controlled by the new department. Up to this time, there had been no interference with the French Army's perception of the aviation units as being its Cinquième Arme (fifth arm), after the infantry, cavalry, artillery and engineers. Transition was slow. In 1932 the Aviation Militaire adopted the RAF practice of maintaining squadrons, wings and groups instead of regi- ments, with the squadron equivalent being the escadrille, although con- fusingly the French 'group' equated to an RAF 'wing', and a 'regiment' to an RAF 'group'! The Armée de l'Air came into existence in August 1933 and achieved autonomy from the French Army in July 1934. While French colonial air units became part of the new organization, most naval units, in- cluding all of those
