into existence in August 1933 and achieved autonomy from the French Army in July 1934. While French colonial air units became part of the new organization, most naval units, in- cluding all of those at sea, remained under naval control, avoiding a mis- take made by the British. Both the British and the French had extensive overseas colonies, and these commitments provided the major part of the peacetime duties for the RAF and the Aviation Militaire, or Armée de l'Air. The Aviation Militaire supported the French Army in Morocco, fighting rebels led by Abd'el Karim, initially using Breguet 19 twin-engined bombers and Farman 140s, a four-engined aircraft which was replaced in 1927 by the Lioré-et-Oliver LeO 200. The RAF also used heavy bombers for colonial policing duties. The idea was that the RAF could help reduce the number of ground troops deployed overseas, especially in the aftermath of German defeat, which had led to several territories being placed under a British mandate by the League of Nations. The most significant economy in ground forces was to come in Iraq, where the advent of bombers and bomber-transports helped bring about a reduction in ground forces from thirty-three bat- talions of infantry, six of cavalry and six artillery batteries to a mixed brigade of British and Indian troops and locally raised native levies, plus four squadrons of RAF-manned armoured cars. At a conference in Cairo, chaired by Winston Churchill, Trenchard proposed that the RAF should be used for the colonial policing role, and from this the RAF was given the responsibility for maintaining control of Iraq. Although initially the RAF in the Middle East was to use the World War I veteran Airco DH9A, the 'Nine Ack', the mainstay of the force was soon to become the Vickers Vimy, a twin-engined bomber biplane  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 54 55 LIVING WITH AIR POWER which had first flown in 1917 but which did not reach RAF squadrons until after the war had ended, in July 1919. The Vimy had g
