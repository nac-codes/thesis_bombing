to gain some practical experience in the exercise of air power, if only in a limited way, the Germans were not going to allow the terms of the Treaty of Versailles to interfere with their longer-term plans for a new air force. It is sometimes believed that Hitler and his supporters take the sole blame for German re-armament, and for the creation of the Luftwaffe in particular. The truth was rather different, as the tone of von Seeckt's order to the MAS indicated. The Germans were determined to have a significant new air service from the day they were forced to disband the Army and Navy aviation units. By the time of the Paris Air Agree- ment in 1926, which once again permitted Germany to produce and operate commercial and private aircraft but not military aircraft, the Deutscher Luftsportsverband had more than 50,000 members in its glid- ing schools, and Germany could justifiably claim to be the most air- minded nation in Europe. German designers saw their aircraft produced in factories in the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden, and later in Spain and Italy as well, so that design skills were completely up-to- date. Nor had the Germans confined themselves to anything so harmless as gliding, although Russian and German development of the glider was to ensure that this too could no longer be viewed as an inoffensive means of flight. Well before the limited concessions of the Paris Air Agreement, the Germans had negotiated with the USSR the right to set up a training school on Soviet territory to train a Reichswehr air arm, the future Luftwaffe. The flying-school, based at Lipetsk, some 250 miles south of Moscow, was one of the unpublicized elements of the Treaty of Rapallo, which re-established diplomatic and trading links between Russia and Germany, as well as absolving Germany of the need to make reparations to Russia as a consequence of German defeat in World War I. Effectively, the Treaty provided a smokescreen for military co-operation. The first training cours
