The Russians were so impressed by the work at Lipetsk that they asked the German Reichswehr to train Soviet night-bomber crews during the early 1930s, but the spin-off to the Soviet Union was relatively limited, for as Hitler came to power during 1933, the Reichswehr decided that Lipetsk had outlived its usefulness. It was in any event difficult to see the school surviving Hitler, with his pronounced anti-Soviet stand and by autumn 1933 the future Führer had finally severed diplomatic relations with the USSR. The Soviet Union did reap some limited benefit. however, in that a well-equipped training base was left to them by the departing Germans, along with thirty or so surviving DXIIIs, although many believe that the Germans left these aircraft only because they could not rely on them to fly back to Germany!
