small number of Heinkel He.50 dive-bombers 57 and a quantity of the then new and revolutionary Heinkel He.111 monoplane bomber. By March 1935 the new air service was strong enough, although not quite up to full strength, for Hitler to renounce the terms of the Versailles Treaty and announce the creation of the Luftwaffe. The German quest for excellence was not always proof against failure, and while the He.50 was too light to be an effective dive-bomber, being more of a fighter-bomber, the Dornier Do.11 was disappointing, as was the twin-engined Do.23 monoplane bomber, and these setbacks led to a continued role as a bomber for the Junkers Ju.52/3m. The trimotor Ju.52/3m had originally appeared as a single-engined aircraft, using the cantilever monoplane concept which owed so much to the pioneering work of Hugo Junkers. Few Ju.52/3ms remained in the bombing role on the outbreak of World War II, but the aircraft was to be used as a trainer for bomber crews, even though its trimotor configuration and the fixed undercarriage, as well as the steering wheel in place of the stick used on operational bombers, meant that its usefulness in this role must have been limited. Ostensibly a heavy bomber, its maximum speed of 180 mph made it something of a sitting duck, and a single 13-mm machine- gun fired from an open turret in the dorsal position did little to dispel this impression. There was already a considerable variation emerging in bomber types by this time. Air forces generally were still living on the experience of World War I, with the Royal Air Force and the Arm√©e de l'Air looking for a mix of light, medium and heavy bombers, with distinct types for night and day operations, with light, and preferably fast, aircraft seen as the ideal day bomber. The RAF had failed to keep pace with the growth in aircraft sizes and had nothing to compare with the French Farman 140 four-engined night bomber when that first appeared in 1925, but it could also be argued that the RAF had no
