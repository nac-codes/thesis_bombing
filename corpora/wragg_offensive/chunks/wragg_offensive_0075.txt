pace with the growth in aircraft sizes and had nothing to compare with the French Farman 140 four-engined night bomber when that first appeared in 1925, but it could also be argued that the RAF had no requirement for such an aircraft at the time, and further that, unlike the French, the RAF would have aircraft of the right size in reasonable, if not fully adequate, numbers available to it when the time came. There was above all a close relation- ship between strategy and the aircraft available. The RAF had the ideal aircraft for colonial policing and envisaged what was effectively ten years' notice of a major conflict breaking out. The French had gone for a balanced approach to air power, but political and economic problems in France during the late 1930s were to wipe out this advantage, enjoyed for so long during the 1920s and even into the early 1930s. The British and the French favoured the use of air power in its true strategic sense, while the Americans suffered from the influence of Army and Navy thinking on the role of airpower, with aircraft subservient to the needs of commanders on the ground or at sea. True, under an agreement reached in 1932, the United States Navy agreed that strategic  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON LIVING WITH AIR POWER 58 air power should be the preserve of the United States Army Air Corps, and by this it meant that the USAAC would be responsible for long-range bombing, for reconnaissance and for the fighter defence of the United States. The sole exception to this rule was continued naval dominance of long-range maritime reconnaissance, while both air arms retained a small air transport element. The United States Army nevertheless en- sured that the USAAC applied most of its energies, and budget, to tactical air power, and it was partly for this reason that the USAAC, and to some extent the USN as well, favoured the dive-bomber and its near relation the torpedo-bomber. Given the technology of the day, such aircraft could place a substantial war
