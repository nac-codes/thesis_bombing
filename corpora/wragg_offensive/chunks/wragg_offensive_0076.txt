ason that the USAAC, and to some extent the USN as well, favoured the dive-bomber and its near relation the torpedo-bomber. Given the technology of the day, such aircraft could place a substantial warload as accurately as possible, with the Martin XT5M-1 dive-bomber being able to lift a 1,000-lb bomb, while Douglas had built the DT-1 torpedo-bomber and Keystone had also built a series of dive-bombers, the LB-5, LB-6 and LB-7. One of the more successful designs was the Curtiss A-3 Falcon, seventy-six of which were delivered to the USAAC during 1927 and 1928. Such aircraft appealed to the needs of surface commanders but lacked the ability to carry heavy warloads over long distances, let alone deliver such tonnages accurately, since the inertial and momentum, as well as the structural problems of a larger aircraft, made these unsuitable for dive-bombing. In spite of its professed desire to be an instrument of strategic air power, the Luftwaffe was developing in the same way as the USAAC at this time, but unlike its American counterpart, it would not reverse its bias and become an operator of large bombers. Many Luftwaffe officers saw the potential of a large long-range heavy bomber, but they had to face opposition within an air service which had been more interested in fighting battles to gain control of all German military and naval aviation than in fighting a battle to make its own decisions over its role in warfare. The decision was to favour large numbers of medium and dive-bombers rather than a smaller number of heavy bombers. Part of the problem lay in the absence of a war between developed nations, and it was not to be until the Spanish Civil War of the late 1930s that the merits of the differing approaches to air power were to be judged - even then the judgement was superficial and incomplete. Time and again, the experience pointed to the soundness of integrating bombers, and essentially dive-bombers, with highly mobile mechanized armoured units, so that a fast
