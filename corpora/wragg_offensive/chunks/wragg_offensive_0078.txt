the fast, light bomber. The initial attraction was the result of a designer following his own inclinations in a way which would not be possible today, and this was followed by an Air Force officer acting on his own initiative in turn - again, something which could not happen today, in any air force! On a visit to the United States, Sir Richard Fairey, owner of the aircraft company which bore his name, was impressed by the new Curtiss D-12 engine, the equal to the Bristol Jupiter engine in terms of capacity and power output but its superior in drag reduction. Fairey set about designing an aeroplane around the D-12, for which he obtained a pro- duction licence, producing a prototype light day bomber biplane, which he called the Fox. The aircraft could manage a maximum 156 mph at sea-level, and 150 mph at 10,000 feet with a 460-lb bombload. It was not only faster than the Fairey Fawn fighter-bomber but could outclimb and fly faster than the RAF's fighters. After a first flight in January 1925, the aircraft was demonstrated to Trenchard, who promptly ordered a squadron on the spot, upsetting the Air Ministry civil servants by abruptly bypassing the normal evaluation and procurement procedures. Although almost thirty were built for the RAF, only one squadron was formed, due to financial stringency, and a fighter design, the Firefly, which was intended to use the D-12 engine for a maximum speed of 188 mph, never got off the drawing-board. In the end, Fairey never built the D-12 under licence, instead buying engines from Curtiss because of the limited production run, which made the investment in production facilities uneconomic. The single Fox squadron, No. 12, incorporated a Fox into its squadron badge. On the annual air exercises in August 1928 a determined effort by RAF fighters to intercept the Fox light bombers failed because of the high speed of these aircraft.
