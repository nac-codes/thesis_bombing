ghters to intercept the Fox light bombers failed because of the high speed of these aircraft.  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 60 LIVING WITH AIR POWER The poor drag characteristics of the radial engine, such as the Bristol Jupiter and engines from other manufacturers, including Pratt & Whit- ney, was no longer outweighed by the lighter weight of such engines as aircraft speeds rose. Nevertheless, radial engines were soon given a new lease of life by the introduction of ring cowls around the cylinders; the cowls had been developed by the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, the predecessor of today's National Aeronautics and Space Administration, in the United States, and were known for many years, appropriately enough, as 'NACA cowls'. It would be tempting to believe that the limitations on Fairey's success were due entirely to the way in which he and Trenchard had outwitted the establishment, but there were other reasons as well. In the major aircraft manufacturing countries, there were many more manufacturers than today, and instead of air forces being limited to the products of a single national manufacturer, with a take-it-or-leave-it choice of just one type of aircraft for a single role, or perhaps even a machine produced as the result of international collaboration, there were several de- signs for each purpose. In addition to the Hyderabad and the Virginia, the RAF also received Boulton Paul Sidestrand medium bombers dur- ing the late 1920s, followed during the early 1930s by a development of this aircraft, the Overstrand, with a power-operated nose turret for the first time. Just one squadron of Sidestrands was ordered from the manufacturer. For the Fox, the competitor was the Hawker Hart two-seat biplane day bomber, using the first 'V' engine from Rolls-Royce, the Kestrel. At 180 mph, the Hart could outrun the RAF's Bristol Bulldog fighters with their maximum speed of 174 mph. The Kestrel engine was retrofitted to the Foxes, while the Hart itself was to be ord
