Kestrel. At 180 mph, the Hart could outrun the RAF's Bristol Bulldog fighters with their maximum speed of 174 mph. The Kestrel engine was retrofitted to the Foxes, while the Hart itself was to be ordered for twenty Royal Air Force and Royal Auxiliary Air Force, or Air Force Reserve, squadrons. Certainly, even the Fox was outclassed by the new aircraft, with its range of 420 miles and warload of 520 lbs, while it took just eight minutes to reach 10,000 feet, and even then the Hart could keep on climbing to a ceiling of 21,320 feet if the crew had oxygen. Fighter, reconnaissance and fighter-bomber variants flowed from the original Hart, which was itself updated in a development, the Hind day bomber, which first flew in 1934. The air gunner in the rear cockpit of the Hart also acted as the bomb- aimer, a fairly usual combination of duties in an aircraft of this type, although later the roles of navigator and bomb-aimer were to be com- bined in some air forces and aircraft types, which showed a more logical combination of skills. To aim bombs, the Hart gunner/bomb-aimer had to crawl beneath the pilot's seat to his bomb-aiming position, which included a duplicate set of instruments showing airspeed and altitude, while there was a course-setting bomb-sight over a sliding panel in the 61 floor of the fuselage, which slid back so that the bombs could be sighted. Each wing could take either four 20-lb and one 112-lb bombs or a single 250-lb bomb - all this on what was a very small aeroplane, with a wingspan of just over thirty-seven feet for the upper wing, and thirty- one feet for the lower wing. Fairey did also produce the rival to the RAF's last biplane bomber, the Heyford, which used two 525-hp Kestrels for a range of 920 miles, cruising at 142 mph at 13,000 feet with up to 3,500 lbs of bombs. The Heyford first joined No. 99 squadron in November 1933 and equipped nine squadrons eventually, with the final batch of Mk.IIIs not being delivered until 1935, by which time suc
