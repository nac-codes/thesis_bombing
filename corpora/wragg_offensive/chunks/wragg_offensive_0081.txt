3,500 lbs of bombs. The Heyford first joined No. 99 squadron in November 1933 and equipped nine squadrons eventually, with the final batch of Mk.IIIs not being delivered until 1935, by which time such modern airliner types as the Douglas DC-2 and the Boeing 247 had flown, surpassing the Heyford's performance. Fairey's rival to the Heyford, the Hendon, was the RAF's first all-metal monoplane bomber, although this aircraft still retained a fixed undercarriage, in spite of introducing bomber pilots to the luxury of an enclosed cockpit. Just one squadron of Hendons was ordered, with the production aircraft being known as Hendon IIs, and the first aircraft joining No. 38 squadron at Mildenhall during March 1936. The perform- ance of 155 mph at 15,000 feet, even when considered against a 1,360- mph range and a warload of 1,660 lbs, was poor when set against fighter speeds climbing towards the 300-mph mark. The heavy bomber was not confined to Western Europe. The Soviet Union had long been interested in large aircraft, with the legacy of the Ilya Mourametz dying hard. During the late 1920s Oleg Antonov developed a twin-engined bomber, the ANT-4, for the VVS (Voenno- Vozdushnye Sily - Army Aviation Forces), following this with his ANT-6 four-engined bomber during the early 1930s. This large monoplane, with a fixed undercarriage, was often known in Soviet service as the TB-2 and, like the earlier ANT-4, also gave birth to a transport variant, the G-2, used for many of t of the early Soviet demonstrations of paratroop assaults. Antonov was at least largely left to work in peace, unlike his compatriot, Andrei Tupolev, who produced much of his work as a political prisoner, managing to do this partly through the capabilities of his assistant, Petlyakov, who also designed a number of bombers, some of his own but often owing much to Tupolev's inspiration. In spite of this growing interest in the heavy bomber, when an opportunity occurred to use bombing aircraft, during the Sino-S
