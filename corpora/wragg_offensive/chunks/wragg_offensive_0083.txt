st 3,000 aircraft of all types at this time, including training aircraft and those with auxiliary units. Still, German aircraft production was already running at 200 aircraft per month and reached 300 before the end of the year. The Luftwaffe could already look ahead to the day when it would achieve parity with the world's strongest air force, the Arm√©e de l'Air: a flying start indeed. Hermann Goering was the Commander in Chief, and as his Chief of Staff he appointed General Wever, a staunch protagonist of the strategic bomber. Wever already had plans for a long-range heavy bomber force, the so-called 'Uralbomber' project, based on the Dornier Do.19 and the Junkers Ju.89 prototypes. Fortunately the British were well aware of the potential of the strategic bomber and of technical developments in aviation. The country which still depended on biplanes for defence and offence was the same one which had set many new air-speed records and won the Schneider Trophy in three successive contests, to capture it outright. Better still, there were few delusions, even if the prospect of war with Germany was consistently played down and rearmament delayed for as long as possible: the British were thorough in their assessment of their own strengths and weaknesses. A warning had sounded as early as 1934. During the summer, the annual air exercises had consisted of night bombing raids on London and Coventry, with the Air Ministry and the West India Docks being  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 64 the main targets in London. Only forty per cent of the attacking aircraft had been intercepted by the RAF's fighters, and the situation might have been less favourable to the defences had not an entire bomber squadron been grounded throughout the exercises due to technical difficulties, or if the weather had been better. It really did seem that the 'bomber would always get through'. Controversy still reigned over whether the bomber should be used as a means of retaliation, with some, such as the editor
