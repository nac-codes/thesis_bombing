ing trials in February 1935. Thus was born radio direction-finding - RDF to the British and 'radar' to the Americans. Approval was given after further experiments and refinement of the original system into a practical production system, in August 1937, for the construction of a chain of radio location stations around the coast of Great Britain. Twenty were operational by the outbreak of World War II, with another three over- seas. If any aeroplane could claim to be the ancestor of the heavy bomber, it was Igor Sikorsky's Bolshoi or 'Grand', predecessor of his Ilya Mourametz or Giant', which was an airliner which entered service as a bomber! One of the hazards of having a rear-gunner was that your own aircraft could get shot up, which is exactly what happened to this Airco D.H.9A, a famous 'Nine Ack' in March, 1918. The 1930s were to be a period of intense technical development, overshadowed only by the major strides which were to follow under the pressures of World War II. Not a few of the major assets of the war years were available before the onset of hostilities but were fully appreciated only after experience of warfare. Aeroplanes of all types changed their shapes during the 1930s, with the biplane being surpassed by the sleeker and more drag-efficient monoplane, a development as important for the S  os de Early air raid damage; the St John's Ambulance Hospital at Etaples in France during 1918. Fortunately, incendiaries had not been used. Murray Sueter asked Frederick Handley Page for a 'bloody paralyser of an aeroplane', and this was it, the Handley Page 0/100, seen here during World War I at Manston in Kent. Too late for World War I, the V/1500 entered service with the newly formed Royal Air Force in 1918. Had the war continued, this aircraft would have raided Berlin. BS 34 During the early heady days of German success, first in Poland and then in the west, the Junker Ju.52/3m Stuka dive- bomber was at the peak of its effectiveness. Here a Stuka releases its
