rlin. BS 34 During the early heady days of German success, first in Poland and then in the west, the Junker Ju.52/3m Stuka dive- bomber was at the peak of its effectiveness. Here a Stuka releases its load of high explosive as it screams towards its hapless victims. 1111 Oleg Antonov ANT-6, or TB-3, four- engined heavy bombers in service with the Russian Air Force's Far East Command, flying over the River Amur in 1936. Airliner design took a massive leap forward with the Douglas DC-2, predecessor of the DC-3 or, in military service, C-47. The aerodynamic surfaces of the DC-2 were used on the B-18 medium bomber shown here.  D . RH To RH LO RH The RAF sent the Advanced Air Striking Force to France to accompany the BEF, but the vulnerability of bases in France to surprise attack meant that the AASF had to depend on aircraft which were outclassed, such as these Fairey Battle light bombers, somewhere in France, early in 1940. The Bristol Blenheim was the RAF's main medium-bomber during the early years of World War II, until replaced by the brilliant de Havilland Mosquito. The Blenheim too had impressed, but the rate of development was such that it was soon outclassed. The Armstrong Whitworth Whitley was one of the aircraft which kept Bomber Command in business during the early years of World War II, but by the time this photograph was taken, in February, 1942, its operational life was limited, although many did sterling work as glider tugs. The invasion of France caught the Arm√©e de l'Air operating elderly aircraft such as this Amiot 143, with an AASF Fairey Battle in the background.  Expecting massive German air raids far in excess of what eventually did occur, the British set up a system of shadow factories so that production would not stop. This is a Handley Page Halifax heavy bomber being built at London Transport's major bus overhaul works at Aldenham. Antonov's assistant, Petlyakov, designed the Pe-2 medium bomber, and a formation of these is seen on a raid against
