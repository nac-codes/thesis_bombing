d for the aircraft to be able to carry a sizeable warload not only to Moscow and Leningrad but beyond, to the Ural mountains, the limit to Europe The Luftwaffe's heaviest bomber was the Heinkel He.177, but this aircraft, with two engines in each of the wing nacelles, arrived too late and was also dangerously unreliable.  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 66 READY FOR BATTLE recognized by Napoleon. Such an aircraft offered the Luftwaffe the capability of ranging freely over those parts of the Soviet Union with the highest concentration of heavy industry, including the aircraft industry, and of maintaining aerial superiority over an area wide enough to ensure that the Russians would have difficulty in mounting air raids against targets in Germany, or even in Eastern Europe. It soon became clear both to the General Staff and to the aircraft industry that the desired performance could not be delivered by a twin-engined aircraft and that the 'Uralbomber' would have to be four-engined. In 1936, as the Junkers Ju.89 and the Dornier Do.19 reached the prototype stage, Deichmann, Chief of Branch 1 (Operations) of the General Staff, regarded both aircraft as adequate for future development although it was clear that both needed more powerful engines than those then available. Milch, Goering's deputy, agreed with Deichmann, but little effective action was taken to develop more powerful engines and so continue development of the aircraft themselves following the death of Wever. Before long, Goering himself suspended all work on heavy bomber development, supported by a change in the attitudes of the General Staff following Wever's demise. There were many reasons for this change of heart in the Luftwaffe hierarchy. One of them was the growing realization that the strains of the German rearmament programme, and the shortages of raw materials and the strains on finance in particular, meant that at the most only a thousand heavy bombers could be built, against several times that number of medium
