rogramme, and the shortages of raw materials and the strains on finance in particular, meant that at the most only a thousand heavy bombers could be built, against several times that number of medium bombers with twin engines. Milch in particular was a strong advocate of the twin-engined bomber, and especially of the Junkers Ju.88. The underlying attitude, which tended towards the con- cept of a lightning war (Blitzkrieg), with strongly integrated armoured ground forces and air power, also meant that the heavy bomber was not given its proper place in the order of priorities. The General Staff paid lip-service to the theories of Douhet, but their actions indicated a strong support for the theories of Liddell Hart, in spite of the Luftwaffe's independence from the two traditional services. Even so, the logic of a heavy bomber with the power to strike at Russian heavy industry, and to knock out Soviet airfields and lines of communication, was inescapable. In 1937 the General Staff sought a heavy bomber with twice the warload of the earlier Junkers Ju.89 and Dornier Do.19 projects and considered a project known as the Heinkel He.119, but the prevailing wisdom, or lack of it, meant that this four-engined aeroplane was also rejected. In the end, a 'twin' was chosen which really had four engines, the Heinkel He.177, with two engines in each of its two nacelles, but even this was to become a 'start-stop' project, depending on the mood or the successes of the day. When it eventually did enter service, it was 67 unpopular with Luftwaffe aircrew, who called it 'the flaming coffin', because of its tendency to catch fire as the engines overheated. The need for four-engined aircraft with a substantial range never went away, and for maritime-reconnaissance and anti-shipping operations the Luftwaffe received the Junkers Ju.90 and the Focke-Wulf Fw.200 Condor, both of which were elegant four-engined aircraft developed from airliners but which also demonstrated the German ability to
