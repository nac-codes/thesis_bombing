the Luftwaffe received the Junkers Ju.90 and the Focke-Wulf Fw.200 Condor, both of which were elegant four-engined aircraft developed from airliners but which also demonstrated the German ability to produce large four- engined aircraft with a long range. Strangely, German attitudes were paralleled in the Soviet Union. In spite of their earlier experience in developing large multi-engined bombers, increasingly the Russians showed a preference for ordering and operating aircraft with potential for close support operations, and the interest in the large heavy bomber became desultory at best. Under Tupolev, the ANT-42 bomber was developed and entered service as the TB-7, giving the Russians a large four-engined bomber monoplane of a configuration familiar to the British. After Tupolev's imprisonment in one of Stalin's purges, the design was taken over by V. M. Petlyakov and subsequently appeared as the Pe-8, capable of lifting the then not inconsiderable warload of 8,500 lbs. Another Tupolev design was the ANT-40, or SB-2, light bomber, which later became the Pe-2. The reasons for the Russians neglecting strategic air power are unclear. Lack of technical ability and of raw materials, and limitations on industrial capacity, may well have been responsible to an extent. The political power of the Soviet Army should not be underestimated either, and it is only in relatively recent times, since the early 1960s, that the Soviet Navy has come to be a force to be reckoned with, for example. At the same time, there may have been some distrust of any weapon which took its crew too far from the Soviet Union, a theory which becomes plausible if one bears in mind that the Russians habitually imprisoned returning prisoners of war for surrendering to the enemy. Purges had also been the curse of Soviet defence policy between the two world wars. A strategic air defence force had been planned, under the title of the 'Army of Special Designation', and General V. B. Khripin was named as i
