much of the 1930s, and that the best solution was the ability to retaliate in kind. There was logic to this; it was no good facing a German capability to destroy British industry unless a similar capability was possessed by the RAF. The mood in the country was changing, spurred on by the failure of a disarmament conference sponsored by the League of Nations. As early as March 1934, even before the alarming air exercises of that summer the then Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, declared that the RAF should no longer be inferior in size and equipment to any air force within striking distance of Britain's shores. This was two years after the collapse of the disarmament conference at Geneva, and by this time the RAF had a regular strength of seventy-four squadrons, plus another thirteen auxiliary squadrons, giving a total of 850 front-line aircraft with forty-one squadrons operating 488 aircraft for UK defence. Nevertheless, the British were to catch up quickly. It was just another two years before, in 1936, the 'shadow factory' concept was introduced, with companies in the motor industry and engineering, including major vehicle and railway overhaul workshops, being assigned to shadow the production of major aircraft factories, offering both the prospect of being able to increase production in a crisis and of maintaining production should the parent factory be damaged in an air raid. As tension built up in Europe, the Germans were to have nowhere near the success of the British in putting industry onto a war footing, and the shadow factory was to be one of the major initiatives in ensuring British survival during the first harsh years of war. In spite of its long-running interest in the heavy bomber, the Royal Air Force still maintained a strong belief in the potential of the fast, light bomber. The success of the Fairey Fox and then of the Hawker Hart and its development, the Hind, able for a short period at least to match and even exceed the fighter speeds of the day,
