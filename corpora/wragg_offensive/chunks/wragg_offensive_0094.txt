e fast, light bomber. The success of the Fairey Fox and then of the Hawker Hart and its development, the Hind, able for a short period at least to match and even exceed the fighter speeds of the day, seemed a vindication of this policy. Yet the fundamental flaw was that these aircraft soon lost their 69 advantage, long before replacements could be placed in service, and none of these aircraft was involved in a war with an enemy of similar sophistication. The concept of small, fast, lightweight bomber aircraft was fine and even economical in terms of colonial policing or a minor war. The RAF did not envisage such aircraft carrying the war home to a well-defended enemy but instead saw a role in what has become known as interdiction bombing, making accurate attacks on an enemy's lines of communications and key military installations, as well as helping to ease the pressure on front-line troops by attacking enemy troop concen- trations or artillery batteries. Convinced of the need for a light bomber with a single engine, the RAF selected another Fairey aircraft, the Battle, to meet this specification. With its sleek monoplane configuration this aircraft appeared to be a good idea when selected in 1933, but was subsequently to fall easy prey to German fighters, and even as early as 1937, when it entered squadron service, it already seemed slow and under-armed, with an indifferent range and warload performance. In just four years, the shape of military aeroplanes had changed, the biplane fighters were going, and the Hawker Hurricane showed what was in store for the bomber of the future. The British concept of the light but fast bomber also lacked accuracy in delivery of bombs, making it inferior to such often-criticized concepts as the German Junkers Ju.87 'Stuka' dive-bombers which, while slow, were accurate and could deliver a sizeable bomb onto or close to a target. Yet these too had their day and then found themselves out- classed not only by fighters but by increasin
