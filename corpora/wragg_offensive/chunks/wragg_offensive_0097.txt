ented to the RAF in the usual approved manner, it would not have gone beyond the design stage. In 1932 the Air Ministry had produced a specification for a medium bomber, B9/32, requiring that the successful design would be a twin-engined monoplane. The design selected was that from Handley Page, the HP 52, and this was ready for its first flight on 21 June 1936. The Handley Page Hampden was an aeroplane not to be mistaken for anything else: it had a narrow but deep fuselage and a thin boom to the tailplane, so that it earned its service nickname 'the flying frying-pan'. In spite of its odd appearance, the Hampden was regarded as a nice aeroplane to fly, even though the prototype suffered the disintegration of part of one engine and a propeller on its first flight and later survived a wheels-up landing. The first 180 Hampdens were powered by twin 71 Bristol Pegasus XVIII radials of 965 hp each, while another hundred aircraft were ordered from Shorts, using Napier Dagger engines and known as the Handley Page Hereford. The first production Hampden was flown in May 1938 and managed 265 mph at 15,000 feet with a 4,000-lb bombload. This was no bad performance by the standards of the day, and the aircraft was also easy to manufacture, being built in two halves with plumbing already installed before final assembly. It was even considered by the Royal Swedish Air Force; although eventually this service decided on the Junkers Ju.86, it was only after replacing the Jumo diesels of the Junkers with Pratt & Whitney Hornets and Bristol Mercury radials. The Swedish decision, taken after receiving a pattern aircraft, was the more surprising because the Ju.86 was not regarded as a successful aircraft, even by the Germans, and as World War II progressed, there were moves to convert these aircraft to a more conventional engine and use them as bomber trainers, at the same time releasing the instrument flying-school Ju.52/3ms for air-transport operations and providing the schools with a
