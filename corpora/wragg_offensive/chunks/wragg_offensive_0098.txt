aircraft to a more conventional engine and use them as bomber trainers, at the same time releasing the instrument flying-school Ju.52/3ms for air-transport operations and providing the schools with aircraft more akin to those the student pilots would eventually fly on operations. The move would have prevented the disruption to the bomber training programme which always followed a major air-transport assault or re- supply operation, but it was not to be. The Battle was not the only single-engined light bomber chosen for the RAF, and another of these aircraft, while of limited operational distinction, was of considerable significance in the development of the bomber. A 1931 Air Ministry specification, G4/31, called for a single- engine bomber to replace the RAF's Fairey IIIF, Seal & Blackburn Baffin. At a time of some uncertainty over aircraft configuration, and no doubt some concern as to whether or not the RAF should be conventional or adventurous in its procurement decisions, Vickers offered two designs, a monoplane and a biplane. Almost as expected, the Air Ministry played it safe, ordering the biplane, which became the Vickers Wildebeest. Vickers developed the monoplane, incorporating some of the design features of the biplane but then switching to a geodetic structure to provide greater strength to the fuselage, naming this private-venture design, which cost just Â£30,000 to develop, the Wellesley. A distinguish- ing feature was its exceptionally large monoplane wingspan, of more than seventy-four feet. Belatedly, the Air Ministry realized the impor- tance of the monoplane and ordered ninety-six, with the first Wellesleys joining No. 76 squadron RAF at Finningly in April 1937 as a twin-seat light bomber. The single 925-hp Bristol Pegasus XX radial gave a maximum speed of 228 mph at 19,500 feet, or a ceiling of 33,000 feet, while a 2,000-lb internal bombload could be carried over 1,100 miles. The observer had a hand-trained machine-gun to fire, while another fixe
