The observer had a hand-trained machine-gun to fire, while another fixed machine-gun could be fired by the pilot through the propeller  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 72 73 READY FOR BATTLE blades. The aircraft became best remembered for a flight in November 1938, by three specially modified Wellesleys from Ismailia in Egypt to Darwin in Australia, flying non-stop over the 7,162 miles in forty-eight hours. While the Wellesley offered many advances in performance, some- thing far larger was required by the RAF, the Wellington medium bomber, with a weight of 18,556 lbs against the Wellesley's 6,369 lbs. Originally intended to meet the Air Ministry Specification B9/32, the Wellington started development as a high-wing monoplane with a fixed under-carriage and two Bristol Mercury engines, but in 1933 the specification changed to a mid-wing aircraft with retractable under- carriage and two Rolls-Royce Goshawk engines. The revised design was designated the Vickers Type 271, and a single prototype was ordered in 1933, although, as the Goshawk engine's evaporative cooling proved troublesome, Bristol Pegasus radial engines of 850 hp each were substi- tuted. The first flight of the Wellington was on 15 June 1936, and the aircraft was ready for the Hendon Air Display of that year. Unusually for a bomber aircraft, most versions of the Wellington had windows down the side of the fuselage, which revealed the structure, so for the appearance at Hendon, the fuselage was covered in fabric to conceal details of the structure from prying eyes. The Air Ministry ordered 180 Wellingtons, the first of 11,460 production aircraft built between 1937 and October 1945, revising the specification to incorporate power- operated gun turrets in the nose and tail, although an idea for a dorsal turret was dropped.
