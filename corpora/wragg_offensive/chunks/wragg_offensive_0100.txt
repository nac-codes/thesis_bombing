e specification to incorporate power- operated gun turrets in the nose and tail, although an idea for a dorsal turret was dropped. The Wellington, known as the 'Wimpey' to RAF Bomber and Coastal Command aircrew, was one of the first aircraft to involve production at a shadow factory, with the main factory at Brooklands, near Weybridge, being shadowed by a factory at Broughton. near Chester; eventually a second shadow factory was opened at Squires Gate, Blackpool, in addition to aircraft built by Gloster. Later versions had the 1,500-hp Bristol Hercules engine instead of the 1,000-hp Pegasus of the early production machines, and the Mk. III finally dropped the all-revealing fuselage windows, some years after World War II had started! The armament of the Wellington was another idea mooted by the RAR in their bid to make the bomber invulnerable to fighter attack. Obviously, larger bombers could not offer speed, although the 250-mph Wellington had a respectable turn of speed for a bomber of its size, and its range, at 1,250 miles, was well beyond that of any fighter of the day. The difference in attitudes to bomber design and the concept of bombing was also demonstrated by divergences in aircraft armament. From this time onwards, the RAF believed firmly in the concept of nose and tail armament for all but its lightest and fastest bombers, and on the heavier aircraft there would be a dorsal turret as well. Such strong defence would, it was thought, make daylight raids possible in relative safety for the bomber crew. It was to be some time before the United States Army Air Corps or its World War II successor, the United States Army Air Force, would accept that heavy armament was essential. The Germans hoped that speed would suffice. They also economized on aircrew by placing a small crew together in the forward part of their aircraft, which was good for morale and communication but meant that the tail was left unguarded, and it was soon clear that the dorsal turret would
