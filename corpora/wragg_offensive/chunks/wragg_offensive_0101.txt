a small crew together in the forward part of their aircraft, which was good for morale and communication but meant that the tail was left unguarded, and it was soon clear that the dorsal turret would never provide satisfactory rear protection because of the blindspots created by the fuselage, and the danger of shooting off parts of one's own tailplane. The position of the rear gunner was unenviable, often cold, and there was a real risk of his becoming trapped in a crippled aircraft. Also communications inside the aircraft could suffer if flak or fighter machine- gun damage was too serious. Yet rear gunners kept British and, eventu- ally, American bomber casualties lower than they would otherwise have been. The British had some preconceived ideas, but they were also capable of ditching a concept which had outlived its usefulness. When a develop- ment of the Wellington, the Warwick, was produced, with two 1,850-hp Pratt & Whitney Double Wasps, it was soon realized that the advent of the heavy bomber, the Stirling, Halifax and Lancaster, had meant that the future for bomber development lay with large four-engined aircraft. Thus the Warwick was abandoned after a few aircraft had been built, with these being diverted to carrying airborne lifeboats and operating on search-and-rescue missions. Other sizeable British twin-engined bombers were less successful. Armstrong-Whitworth produced the Whitley, but this aircraft was soon relegated to glider-towing and paratroop-dropping duties, and before long for these too it was superseded by the Stirling and then the Halifax. During the last five years of peace, the RAF's front-line strength rose from fewer than 800 aircraft to almost 2,000, while that of the Luftwaffe rose from 400 to almost 4,000. The Luftwaffe grew to a force of 1.5 million officers and men on the outbreak of war, in addition to the paratroops and anti-aircraft artillery, both of which were Army responsibilities in the British armed forces. In 1939 the RAF had
