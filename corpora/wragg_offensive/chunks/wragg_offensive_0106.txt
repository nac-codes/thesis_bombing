operating from the Kaga suffering heavy losses from Chinese aircraft flown by foreign pilots. Unfortunately, with their newly purchased fighters, the Chinese were still forced to fight a defensive war, and retaliation against the Japanese was out of the question, with the Kaga cruising outside the range of Chinese aircraft. Even so, to assert their aerial superiority, the more powerful Mitsubishi A5M2 Type 96-2 fighter had to be introduced to this theatre of war. By the middle of August the JAAF and JNAF were resorting to a campaign of terror bombing, intended to break the resistance in Chinese towns and cities. Mitsubishi G3M1 Type 96 bombers operating from Taipeh and Kaohsiung in north Formosa made round trips of 1,200 miles to attack the flying-school at Hangchow and the airfield at Kwangtseh, secure in the use of airfields well outside the range of Chinese aircraft. Yet the JNAF lost fifty-four aircraft during three raids on the temporary capital of China, Nanking. Chinese ground- attack aircraft also made operations increasingly difficult for Japanese ground forces and even managed to attack Japanese vessels supporting the invasion. A pause in the raids on Nanking followed these setbacks but this lasted only until October, when heavier versions of the G3M1. designated the G3M2, with additional range and heavier defensive armament, were assigned to the raids, with a vastly strengthened fighter escort. Indeed, on the first of the resumed raids on Nanking, the JNAF sent just nine bombers, with twenty-seven escorting fighters. The war in China was fought over a considerable land area, and as one city became so seriously threatened by the advancing Japanese that it could no longer function as the seat of Chinese Government, so the Chinese naturally enough moved on. It was inevitable, given this fluid war and the distances involved, that frequently situations arose in which bombers had to operate beyond the range of their fighter escorts, often while airfields close
