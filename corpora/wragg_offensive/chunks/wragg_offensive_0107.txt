was inevitable, given this fluid war and the distances involved, that frequently situations arose in which bombers had to operate beyond the range of their fighter escorts, often while airfields closer to the front line were prepared for use, and during these raids the Chinese managed to exact a high penalty for the damage being inflicted by the Japanese. One of the most disastrous raids by the Japanese was on 29 April 1938, when forty bombers were sent against the Chinese Air Force headquarters at Hankow and no fewer than thirty-six of the attacking aircraft were shot down. Even so, Hangchow, Tsinan and Tsingtao had already fallen to the Japanese advance, and Hankow followed on 25 October. The momentum was maintained by Japanese forces for some time afterwards, almost until the series of attacks against United States, British and Dutch territories in the East which coincided with Japanese entry into World War II. Chungking, to which the Chinese Government had retreated, received 168 day bomber and fourteen night bomber raids between May and September 1940. The Chinese fighter defences were unable to match the improvements made by the Japanese in their escort fighters, and eventually the JNAF intro- duced to the Chinese war their most notable fighter, the Mitsubishi A6M2 Type 0 Model 11, the Zero-Sen ('Zero' to the Allies), which became the favoured escort for the G3M2 bombers, and the new Mitsubishi Ki.21 Type 97 bombers, which the JNAF also supplemented with eighty Fiat B.R.20 twin-engined bombers, although the latter tended to be too slow to be an attractive proposition. The Italian aircraft were used in the battle for Hangchow. As with the British during the first part of World War I, the JNAF tended to act as the strategic air arm, while JAAF operated mainly in support of ground forces. The Soviet Union (and, before the Bolshevik Revolution, Tsarist Rus- sia) viewed developments in China as being of considerable importance to Russian interests in the East. Japa
