by the Americans some ten years earlier. The absence of a suitable German powerplant at the time meant that the prototype flew with a Rolls-Royce Kestrel engine, as did the prototype Messerschmitt Bf.109. Unfortunately the prototype lacked dive brakes, essential to limit the rate of descent of a dive-bomber so that the aircraft could be aimed successfully and, more important for the crew, kept under control. During its first dive, the prototype developed severe tail-flutter and crashed. Re-design followed, including the fitting of dive brakes and modifications to the tailplane, while a 640-hp Junkers Jumo engine was also fitted. In this form the aircraft, with its slow maximum speed of just 186 mph, and fixed under-carriage, was ready for trials with the 'Immelmann' squadron early in 1937. The aircraft was able to carry a bombload of up to 1,000 lbs, either with a large single bomb under the fuselage or with a single 500-lb bomb under the fuselage and two smaller bombs, usually 125 lbs each, under each wing; it was  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 80 READY FOR BATTLE fitted with a device to swing the central bomb clear of the aircrew during the dive, and with a siren, the so-called 'Trumpet of Jericho', to unnerve the victims of a dive-bombing attack during the closing stages of the dive. This sadistic device was an essential part of the aircraft's defences, reducing the likelihood of sustained accurate anti-aircraft fire by creating panic amongst ground troops - though it worked only when faced with poorly trained troops. Late in 1937 just three aircraft were deployed to Spain, although many more aircrew gained early experience on the type as a result of rotation, and additional aircraft soon joined those in Spain, seeing heavy fighting in Catalonia. The ability to deliver bombs with great accuracy, and the effectiveness of the aircraft against bridges, railway junctions and shipping, even when operating in close proximity to Nationalist troops, convinced the Luftwaffe even m
