with great accuracy, and the effectiveness of the aircraft against bridges, railway junctions and shipping, even when operating in close proximity to Nationalist troops, convinced the Luftwaffe even more of the impor- tance of supporting the Blitzkrieg and of the effectiveness of the dive- bomber. The name 'Stuka' came from Sturzkampfflugzeug - diving warplane, which the Germans applied to all aircraft of the type but which became associated solely with the Ju.87. Far less successful in Spain was the Junkers Ju.86, a twin-engined medium bomber first flown in 1934 and which served in limited numbers with the Legión Condor, and with even more limited success. Joining the Legión in late 1937, the aircraft's Junkers Jumo vertically opposed two-stroke diesel engines proved too difficult to maintain under field conditions. The Ju.86 was soon withdrawn from operational service. The story does not end here, however, for a plan existed to use the parts available for a thousand Ju.86s to build these aircraft as advanced trainers for bomber pilots and navigators, with the substitution of a conventional aero-engine for the original diesels. This was to be a solution to the problem created by operating Ju.52/3ms in the instrument and navi- gational training role. The Ju.52/3ms were ill suited as advanced training aircraft because of their trimotor configuration, fixed under-carriages and the use of a steering wheel instead of a stick or yoke column. Worse still, the training-school Ju.52/3ms also acted as the Luftwaffe's assault transport force, so that whenever a major airborne operation had to be mounted, the instructors became transport pilots; bomber aircrew training stopped and afterwards could not resume at its earlier throughput due to the loss of many transport aircraft and their aircrew in such costly operations as the invasion of Crete. In desperation at a still early stage in the war, Deichmann, now Chief of Staff to the Chief of Training, suggested that the Ju.52/3ms
