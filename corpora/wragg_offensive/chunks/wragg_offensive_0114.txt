their aircrew in such costly operations as the invasion of Crete. In desperation at a still early stage in the war, Deichmann, now Chief of Staff to the Chief of Training, suggested that the Ju.52/3ms be permanently transferred to a specialized air transport fleet, while the Ju.86 parts be assembled and used as bomber-trainers, a role for which they would have been well suited, given replacement engines, additional fuel tankage and dual controls, since the aircraft conformed to the configuration of a bomber and handled well in the air. The idea was rejected by Goering and his 81 deputy, Milch, for no apparent reason, except perhaps the need to devote aero-engines coming off the production line to combat aircraft. The rejection of the idea did mean, however, that the Luftwaffe was to be burdened by the inadequate training of both its bomber aircrew and its transport aircrew, who were never able to specialize in this role, with its own difficulties. The Dornier Do.17 and Heinkel He.111 were far more successful. The Do.17 had been developed as an airliner for Deutsche Luft Hansa, but its long and cramped fuselage made it uncomfortable for passengers to board and leave, and to sit in, and the aircraft truly deserved its nickname Fliegende Bleistift - 'Flying Pencil', awarded by the Press. The aircraft first came into prominence in July 1937, when it was entered for the Zurich International Military Aircraft Competition, taking part in the circuit of the Alps, although a special version of the aircraft was used for this, with a maximum speed some 50 mph faster than the standard Do.17E-1. First flown as a six-passenger transport in autumn 1934, with a performance profile similar to the Bristol 135's, the production Do. 17E-1 first appeared late in 1936, using two 750-hp BMW engines for a maximum speed of 220 mph with a 1,750-lb bombload, which it could carry for 990 miles. Altogether the most elegant of this trio of German medium bombers, the Heinkel He.111 was designed t
