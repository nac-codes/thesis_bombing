Some historians suggest that the existence of an Anglo-Polish alliance may have caused Hitler to hesitate; others believe that the real reason may have lain in the decision by the Italian dictator, Mussolini, to remain neutral, which would have been a double blow to Hitler because he might have expected Italian military support and because of his admiration for Mussolini at this period. Probably the real reason lay in a combination of these factors, as well as a last-minute analysis as to whether or not Poland could expect help from Britain and France. In the end, it was to matter little. The British and French did not carry conviction, while the Germans did not need Italian help to be assured of a relatively easy and painless victory over the Poles, who were ill prepared for a war which they did not expect to come until 1941 at the earliest.  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 84 85 BLITZKRIEG Polish expectation of a war in 1941 was not based solely on a hopeless optimism; it was an expectation which had been shared by many senior German officers until the early summer of 1939, when they too realized that war was coming. Even then, many Germans did not expect a war with Britain until much later - in some cases 1945 was seen as the most likely and suitable year.

As early as 1937 the German aircraft industry was operating at peak capacity, and a shortage of important me
