half the bomber force consisted of this type. For the invasion of Poland, the Luftwaffe amassed almost 2,000 aircraft, of which nearly 900 were bombers, mainly Dornier Do.17s, Heinkel He.111s and Junkers Ju.87s. The Do.17 could act as a dive-bomber in a shallow dive, while the He. 111 could lift 4,000 lbs of bombs over a tactical range; but the star of the invasion was the Ju.87 Stuka, which struck fear into enemy troop formations as it dived, with its 'Trumpets of Jericho' siren screaming a warning of impending doom. Overall, the Luftwaffe started the Polish campaign with more than 4,000 front-line aircraft, of which 800 were He.111s, 500 Do.17s and 300 Ju.87s, while there were a few of the new and ultimately successful Ju.88A medium bombers, the much-needed replacement for the disappointing Ju.86. The Ju.87 could carry a single 1,000-lb bomb and, in the absence of concentrated anti- aircraft fire or adequate fighter defences, drop this more accurately than any other aircraft at the time; alternatively, it could carry a single 550-lb bomb and four 110-lb bombs on under-wing strongpoints. The Luftwaffe was deployed for the Polish campaign on lines which owed more to Liddell Hart than to Douhet, although the supremacy of the Army and the overwhelming insistence on meeting the requirements of field commanders was to be less than on some later campaigns. The aircraft were organized into two massive air fleets, Luftflotte 1 under General (later Generalfeldmarschall) von Kesselring in the north, and in the south, Luftflotte II under General Lohr. For the most part, the Ju.87 Stukas operated in support of the Army, while the He.111s and Do.17s, escorted by Messerschmitt Bf. 109 fighters, attacked airfields, the first priority, followed by aircraft factories, bar- racks, troop concentrations and communications centres, and then the cities. It took the Luftwaffe just two days to destroy the Polish Air Force. The bulk of the Polish Army was destroyed in eighteen days, but fi
