concentrations and communications centres, and then the cities. It took the Luftwaffe just two days to destroy the Polish Air Force. The bulk of the Polish Army was destroyed in eighteen days, but fierce resistance at Warsaw meant that the capital did not fall until 27 September. Some commentators have been at pains to point out that the Panzer Divisions, fighting against cavalry and the poor logistics of the Polish Army, could have destroyed Poland without the help of the Luftwaffe, although it might have taken longer. This is an over- simplification, since the Panzers themselves could have fallen prey to the Polish Air Force if that had not been promptly neutralized by the Luftwaffe. Not everything went the way the Germans intended. The pre-emptive strike against the approaches to the Dirshau railway bridge was intended to prevent the Poles destroying the bridge, but the Poles succeeded nevertheless. Nor did the Germans manage to prevent a substantial number of Poles escaping to continue the fight as members of Polish units in the British armed forces. Polish cities attacked by the Germans included Cracow and Lvov, raided by aircraft flying from Silesia, while aircraft flew almost 500 miles from their bases in Germany to bomb the Polish capital, and others bombed naval bases in the Baltic. Final surrender by the Poles came on 5 October. Air-raid sirens had sounded in the British Isles almost as soon as the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, finished his radio message at 11 a.m. on 3 September. The sirens sounded a false alarm, but the RAF did not delay in moving to a war footing, placing an early emphasis on reconnaissance.
