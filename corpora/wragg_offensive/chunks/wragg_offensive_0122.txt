from bombing civilian targets, the United Kingdom agreed immediately and the French followed within twenty-four hours; it took several days further before Germany also complied - or at least claimed to do so. Roosevelt's request was wildly unrealistic, but a feature of the first winter of war was to be the restraint applied by the RAF, even at considerable cost to British aircraft and, more important, their crews. Perhaps the greatest criticism of the pressure to, in effect, 'behave decently' was that it probably contributed to the overall bloodshed of World War II, through enabling the Germans to persist in the belief that the British had no stomach for an all-out war with Germany. Others, perhaps realizing that war would be costly, refused to accept that the British and the Germans could fight another war, and believed that peace would soon come. While even a remote chance of peace remained during that first winter, the Germans were themselves insulated from the true effects of war, hearing of victory through Nazi propaganda and being denied the reality of heavy air raids. During 1939 and for much of 1940, German industry was able to continue production with little disturbance from air raids, from mobilization of its workforce for the armed forces, or from disruption to transport and supplies. Few Luftwaffe aircraft were destroyed on the ground by the enemy, and the service was still living off the accumulated reservoir of trained aircrew created during the final years of peace; even amongst those men already serving with their operational units, the net effect was one of a growing volume of experi- enced aircrew. The training system was not under strain from heavy losses, nor from the disruption of its programme by the heavy air- transport efforts which were to become a feature of the German war effort, especially in 1940 and 1941. The truth was that, in some cases almost through to mid-1941, much of Germany and most of the popu- lation were still living in near
