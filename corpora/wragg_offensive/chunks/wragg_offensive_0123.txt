me a feature of the German war effort, especially in 1940 and 1941. The truth was that, in some cases almost through to mid-1941, much of Germany and most of the popu- lation were still living in near peacetime conditions. Recognizing the unreal atmosphere of the early days of war, the British coined the apt term 'phoney war' for the first autumn and winter. Yet they had been moved to a wartime footing by their leaders, with mobilization, including that of women for war production, rationing, severe limitations on public transport and travel, a shadow-factory sys- tem which disrupted production of other peacetime items and an all-out effort to increase public awareness of the true situation. While the news at this early stage was not good for the British, it had not yet assumed the awfulness of mid-1940 onwards. Meanwhile the British made the most of the lull, so that by January 1940 the British aircraft industry produced 157 aircraft against 136 by the Germans; as far as the bomber element went, the British aircraft were heavier and more potent, making the contrast even greater operationally. More important still, the British consistently managed to place the emphasis on the right type of aircraft at the right time: fighters during the early stages of the war; bombers later; then ground-attack aircraft for the battle across Europe, without ever going to the extreme of favouring one type excessively. The Germans never quite managed this and just as consistently failed to make the most of their opportunities, never seeming to appreciate the urgency of having the right aircraft available at the right time, even though they were even more desperate for strategic materials than the British. On occasion, German behaviour could be eccentric. At a time when supplies of duralumin for aircraft production were in critically short supply, the Navy managed to persuade Messerschmitt to use Luftwaffe stocks to build prefabricated termite-proof tropical barracks, in preparation fo
