in for aircraft production were in critically short supply, the Navy managed to persuade Messerschmitt to use Luftwaffe stocks to build prefabricated termite-proof tropical barracks, in preparation for the recovery of the German colonies! To this contrast in attitudes and results can be added the fact that the British could also resort to American and Canadian aircraft factories for additional equipment. Phoney war or not, and at first no one realized that this was to be the case, the Royal Air Force wasted no time in mounting the first operations against Germany. On the day war was declared, a Bristol Blenheim Mk.IV of No. 139 squadron was waiting to take off as soon as the Prime Minister ended his speech, taking a naval observer to reconnoitre the German fleet at Wilhelmshaven. The intention was to radio the position of the German fleet to a flight of three Blenheims waiting, bombed-up, ready to take off and attack the German ships.

After briefing their crews, the three bomber Blenheims took off but soon flew into heavy thunderstorms and, in the failing light, wisely decided to return to base. That night ten Wellingtons took off on a leaflet-dropping raid, but poor navigation left most of their load preaching to the converted in Denmark and the Low Countries.
