the ground, so it was in the air. The initial attack saw seventy British and French airfields in France bombed, although the RAF fared better in this attack than did the Armée de l'Air, simply because the RAF had dispersed its aircraft more widely, denying the Luftwaffe the opportunity of a single 'knock-out' blow. The Armée de l'Air, the Belgian and Dutch Air Forces and the RAF's Advanced Air Striking Force could nevertheless do little in the face of the overwhelming might of the Luftwaffe, which included more than a thousand fighters. The British have since been criticized for keeping the bulk of their combat aircraft in the UK, but the uncertainties of the war, the poor performance of the defence on the ground, and the problems of either having aircraft operating at maximum range over the battlefield from home bases or supplying and defending forward bases in France, all acted to discourage too heavy a commitment which could have delayed, but not prevented, defeat. Subsequent events showed the British decision to have been a wise one. There is little reason to doubt that a larger force would have been almost as easily disposed of, and it would certainly have been more difficult to disperse. In the Netherlands, the Germans seized bridges and airfields, often landing troops while the fighting for possession went on. Although these initial operations were supported by bombers and dive-bombers, the main force of the Luftwaffe's bomber strength was held in reserve for a raid on Rotterdam if the Dutch failed to surrender. On 14 May, while surrender negotiations were in progress, the Luftwaffe's Second Air Fleet took off from Bremen to raid Rotterdam - mainly some forty Junkers Ju.87B Stuka dive-bombers. An order cancelling the operation never reached the Luftwaffe aircrew, and at 16.00 the centre of Rotterdam was bombed so heavily and completely that it was gutted (20,000 build- ings destroyed) and almost a thousand of its citizens lost their lives. The Germans initia
