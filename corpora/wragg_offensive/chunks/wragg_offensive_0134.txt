l haze over the Ruhr area. At the outbreak of war, bomber navigators were expected to plot a course using a compass and a sextant, techniques well suited to shipping, steaming at speeds seldom in excess of fifteen knots, but ill suited to aircraft flying at upwards of twelve times that speed, operating at night and either taking evasive action from enemy fighters or flying a complex course around major anti-aircraft defences. To some extent the Germans could not believe their own success, stopping their advance at one stage for a few days in expectation of a French counter-attack, which, of course, never came. Inter-service rivalry also reared its head, with Goering and the Luftwaffe Chief of Staff, Jeschonnek, claiming that they could wipe out the British Expeditionary Force, which had fallen back to the area around Dunkirk by 24 May. The British meanwhile were hastily improvising an evacuation of the BEF from Dunkirk in 'Operation Dynamo', which started on 27 May and lasted until 4 June. The Luftwaffe ignored the difficulty of bombing troops scattered across a sandy beach, with bombs rendered relatively ineffective unless they landed almost on top of concentrations of men. The Stuka dive-bombers, which had been attacking French civilian refu- gees who had thronged the roads, fell easy prey to RAF fighters when the latter were allowed to fly over the fleet of more than 850 rescue vessels, many of them small fishing-boats and pleasure craft, pressed into service to evacuate 370,000 men. More than 200 of the rescue craft were sunk, but the worst casualty was not at Dunkirk but at St-Nazaire, where the 20,000-ton Lancastrian, with 6,000 men aboard, was attacked and sunk by a force of Junkers Ju.88 bombers, with the loss of 3,000 lives. On one day the Ju.87s managed to sink ten large ships, including three destroyers. There were relatively few prisoners for the Germans from the Dunkirk operation, although they did find more than 50,000 British vehicles, many immobilize
