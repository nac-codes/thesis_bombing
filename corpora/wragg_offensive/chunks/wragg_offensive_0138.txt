four fighter escorts apiece. The 2nd Air Fleet under von Kesselring in the Low Countries and northern France lacked the co-ordination necessary for a major campaign, as did Spearle's units in north-western France. What the Germans did possess was an overwhelming strength, both numerically and in terms of combat experience, which at this early stage of the war was still greater than that of their opponent. Although only 130 of the aircraft in Norway were long-range bombers capable of reaching Britain, west of Brussels and Paris the Luftwaffe had 1,130 longer-range bombers and 320 dive- bombers, as well as more than a thousand single- and twin-engined fighters, mainly Messerschmitt Bf.109s and Me.110s. The bombers in- cluded the Junkers Ju.88, which lacked the range to attack targets in the furthermost parts of the United Kingdom, and the Heinkel He.111 and the Dornier Do.17, as well as the Junkers Ju.87 Stuka. Against the overwhelming fighter strength of the Luftwaffe, the RAF had just 446 single-engined fighters on 4 June, although by 4 August this had risen  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 96 97 BLITZKRIEG to 704 fighters, with the June figure including 331 of the modern Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire fighters, which together accounted for 620 of the August total. The RAF was expanding and modernizing fast, while there had been a ruthless pruning of the number of aircraft types in production, which was reduced to seven major combat aircraft, the Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane fighters, the Short Sunderland flying-boat and the Bristol Blenheim, Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley Mk. V, Handley Page Hampden and Vickers Wellington bombers, during the period immediately before Dunkirk. Other types were not neglected for long, but the greater flexibility of the British system and ability to appreciate just what type of aeroplane was most needed at any particular stage of the war played no small part in enabling the RAF to receive 476 fighters during August 1940, aga
