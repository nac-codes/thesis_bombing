ime they arrived over the coast, all the way to the target and over it, and continue their attack as the bombers fought their way home. The only respite from fighter attack was during the period the bombers spent over intensive anti- aircraft fire, and any bomber crippled by anti-aircraft fire was an easy prey to the fighters awaiting, although initially anti-aircraft artillery was in short supply. Late in the afternoon of 7 September, after what had been a quiet day for the RAF, 625 Luftwaffe bombers and 650 fighters approached the English coast, having been watched as they took off and formated over Cap Gris Nez by Goering himself. At first the RAF thought that the aircraft were intending to raid airfields in Kent and Sussex, but instead the Germans pressed home an attack on Woolwich, Thameshaven and the London docks. Twenty-three RAF fighter squadrons were scrambled, and of these no fewer than twenty-one joined battle, with forty Luftwaffe aircraft lost for a cost of twenty-eight RAF fighters, although the true cost lay in the deaths of 450 civilians and the serious injury of 1,000 more. The fires of this first raid were used to pinpoint targets for a following raid that night. Successive waves with a total of 250 German bombers offloaded 300 tons of bombs and 13,000 incendiary devices onto London that night, for the loss of a single Luftwaffe bomber due to the still weak night fighter defences operating on visual rather than radar control. This really marked the end of the Battle of Britain and the start of the Blitzkrieg: the 'Blitz' on London was to last for the next fifty-seven consecutive nights, with bombs falling from dusk to dawn. The cost of the Battle of Britain had been high, with the RAF losing 297 fighters for 378 Luftwaffe aircraft by 7 September. The Blitz was to mark the start of full-scale bomber offensives by both sides. However, there was more to come, and not for nothing has the RAF maintained that the battle continued to 31 October.
