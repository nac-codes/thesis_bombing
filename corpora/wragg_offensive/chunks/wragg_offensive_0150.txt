with incendiary fires burning in open fields misleading the bomb-aimers into believing that they had arrived over the target. The morale of the Luftwaffe bomber crews started to suffer. Perhaps one of the surest indications that the German bombers had had their day came with the statistical analysis which showed that in September 1940 it took 20,000 rounds of British anti-aircraft fire to shoot down one German bomber, but by February 1942 this was down to 3,000 rounds, by which time there were many more anti-aircraft gun emplacements surrounding targets in Britain. Nevertheless, between November 1940 and February 1941 the Luft- waffe was still able to fly 12,000 night sorties over Britain for a cost of just seventy-five aircraft lost to anti-aircraft fire and night fighters combined. As before, the greatest salvation for the victims lay in the lack of concentrated bombing or persistent raiding, at least compared with the punishment which the RAF and the USAAF combined would inflict later on German targets. In an attempt to reduce injury amongst civilians, the authorities in Britain had issued air-raid shelters, the corrugated-iron Anderson shel- ter, half buried in the gardens of suburban housing estates, and the steel-frame Morrison shelter usually located inside houses. The London underground railway tunnel between Aldwych and Holborn was closed and used as a public air-raid shelter, while at night central London underground stations were used as all-night air-raid shelters, with the public sleeping on the platforms. Fears over the deep-level tube lines of the Underground flooding if one of the tunnels under the River Thames should be hit led to heavy steel doors being placed at the ends of the under-river sections; these remain today on the Northern and Bakerloo Lines. Not that the tube stations were always safe, with many casualties resulting when a bomb pierced the roadway above the Bank Station on the Central Line and travelled down the escalator shaft before
