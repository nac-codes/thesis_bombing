es. Not that the tube stations were always safe, with many casualties resulting when a bomb pierced the roadway above the Bank Station on the Central Line and travelled down the escalator shaft before exploding. Further east, an unopened section of the Central Line was used as a factory by Plessey, a major defence contractor. The Blitz was coming to an end, however, with German attention turning to the east, and the build-up in preparation for the invasion of Russia, 'Operation Barbarossa'. However, before the Germans re- deployed their forces east, some major raids remained during May 1941. The last of these came on the night of 10-11 May, when 550 bombers spread over two major formations dropped more than 700 tons of high explosives and tens of thousands of incendiaries, killing 1,436 people and injuring 3,000 in London, with 700 acres of the city being devastated by a huge firestorm, for the loss of just fourteen bombers. Six days later, 111 bombers raided Birmingham. Between August 1940 and May 1941 the day and night blitz led to the deaths of 44,000 British civilians, while 103,000 were injured, often very badly. The major bombing offensive against first the RAF and then British industrial and communications centres had not been the only problem for the RAF at this lonely period of the war, with France defeated and the British Empire fighting alone. On 10 June 1940 Italy entered the war  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 104 105 BLITZKRIEG on the side of Germany. The Regia Aeronautica had almost 1,000 bombers and another 800 fighters and fighter-bombers ready for what Mussolini doubtless hoped would be a series of easy victories as British forces caved in against the superior might of the combined German and Italian attack. Most of the bombers were the highly effective Savoia-Marchetti S.M.79 Sparviero tri-motor medium bomber, of which there were almost 600, while the later S.M.82 also equipped many more units. The other major tri-motor bomber of the RA at this time was the
