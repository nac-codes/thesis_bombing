Greek forces. A successful invasion of Greece had to wait until April 1941, when the Luftwaffe assigned 400 fighters, bombers and dive-bombers for the invasion of that country, in addition to another 600 aircraft assigned to the invasion of Yugoslavia. Luftflotte IV, commanded by General der Flieger Lohr, controlled the thousand or so combat aircraft used for the attack on Yugoslavia and Greece, which started on 6 April 1941. Eight bomber Gruppen, five with medium bombers and three with dive- bombers, and seven fighter Gruppen, shared the aircraft, but after the initial large-scale air raid on Belgrade the Luftwaffe met with little resistance in either country. Athens was occupied on 27 April. Following up the raid on Greece, the Germans invaded Crete by air on 20 May, with 430 medium and dive-bombers included amongst the 650 combat aircraft supporting the 500 Junkers Ju.52/3m transports. For the Germans, Crete was a costly success, one so expensively bought that never again would airborne forces figure prominently in German invasion plans. For the Luftwaffe, the cost was proportionately greater, and not just because the paratroops involved were members of the Luftwaffe rather than the Army, as is British and American practice: 170 of the 500 Ju.52/3m transports assigned to the airborne invasion were shot down, losing not only the aircraft but also the scarce bomber pilot and navigator instructors flying these aircraft on loan from the instrument flying schools. This was to be one of several major disasters for the bomber units in the Luftwaffe. A significant feature of the combined German and Italian air operations in the Mediterranean was the emphasis on anti-shipping operations against British convoys to Malta.
