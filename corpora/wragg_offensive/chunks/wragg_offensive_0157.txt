Later, on 12 February 1942, three German capital ships, Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen, steamed through the English Channel in broad daylight, not being spotted until after they had sped through the Straits of Dover, sup- posedly controlled by the British. In late afternoon and in poor light, Lieutenant-Commander Eugene Esmond RN led six Fairey Swordfish biplanes in a torpedo attack against the fast-moving and heavily armed, as well as armoured, German warships. All six aircraft were shot down, with the rescue of just five of the total of eighteen aircrew.

The thrust east- wards had enjoyed a high priority in Hitler's ambitions, but it had been delayed due to the adventures in the Balkans and in Crete. Hitler had expected the Soviet Union to be subjugated within six months, yet he and the General Staff were well aware of the need to seize their key objectives and consolidate them before the onset of the harsh Russian winter. It is surprising that these ambitious and even foolhardy plans were allowed to suffer the delays incurred in saving Italian face in the Balkans, since delay was unacceptable.
