From the strategic aspect, the most serious weakness in the German plan to invade the Soviet Union lay in the inability to neutralize Soviet heavy industry - in particular, the aircraft industry. Like the British, the Russians had been preparing contingency plans to enable production to continue on the outbreak of hostilities, although in their case the plans revolved around the transfer of as much industrial capacity as possible outside the range of German bombers, with much of it moved east of the Urals. The Germans were to rue the decision not to proceed with the Uralbomber project. The successor to the original Uralbomber proto- types, the Heinkel He.177, was subjected to a series of stops and starts in its development, depending on the mood of the moment, and delayed  108 THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 109 BLITZKRIEG by many teething troubles, the forerunner of many technical short- comings and poor reliability. It was not to appear on the Russian Front until it was too late, in mid-1944, by which time severe fuel shortages were to preclude extensive use. No one amongst the Nazi leadership was more aware of these problems than Goering, who earlier than most was forced to appreciate the extent of German weakness, possibly as a result of his own extreme boasts. Goering told Hitler that the Luftwaffe's sacrifices over England would have been in vain if 'Barbarossa' went ahead, appreciating that this would give the British the respite they so badly needed. Goering alone seemed to appreciate the need to secure Gibraltar, Malta and Suez for Germany. In response to Hitler's assertion that Goering would be able to resume operations against Britain within six months of 'Barbarossa' starting, Goering responded that, alone of the German armed forces, the Luftwaffe had been constantly engaged in battle with the enemy since the start of the war.
