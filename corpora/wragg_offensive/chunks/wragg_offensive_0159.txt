f the German armed forces, the Luftwaffe had been constantly engaged in battle with the enemy since the start of the war. One of the most telling comments was Goering's remark to Hitler that, 'I told you when we first went to war that I was going into battle with my training squads; now they are all gone.' Goering doubted Hitler's timetable for the defeat of Russia, pointing out that the ground forces could no longer fight without Luftwaffe support. 'They're always screaming for the Luftwaffe . .. German optimism over the ability of the Soviet armed forces to defend Russia was not entirely without foundation. The Soviet armed forces had suffered from the purges of the Stalin era, and Soviet industry had not been conspicuously successful in meeting the needs of the armed forces, or indeed of any other aspect of Soviet life. The Red Air Fleet was obsolete, and Russia lacked the materials and the entrepreneurial skill necessary to create a truly successful aircraft industry. Backbone of the fighter defences were the I-16 'Rata', developed from a Boeing design and little changed since it first appeared during the Spanish Civil War, and the earlier I-15, with a maximum speed of less than 200 mph. New aircraft were entering production, however, and attention was given to producing those aircraft most likely to be of use during the expected German assault, fighters, ground-attack aircraft and light bombers. In common with the Luftwaffe, the Red Air Force mounted seventy-five per cent of its effort in support of ground forces, and this worked, partly because of the defensive strategy adopted, partly because the assault on German heavy industry, on oil supplies and on the communica- tions networks, were all left to British and American bombers. If the Germans had fought the air war on a wider strategy, the Russians could not have afforded to confine themselves to the same type of ground-support warfare. Air defence would also have been required in greater depth. From autumn
