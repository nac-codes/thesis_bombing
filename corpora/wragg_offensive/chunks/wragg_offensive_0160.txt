war on a wider strategy, the Russians could not have afforded to confine themselves to the same type of ground-support warfare. Air defence would also have been required in greater depth. From autumn 1941 onwards, the new Ilyushin I1-2 Stormovik was entering service with the Soviet Air Force. This heavily armoured ground-attack aircraft needed a direct hit by light or medium anti-aircraft artillery to be put out of action, although it was highly vulnerable to attack from above or behind, especially if explosive cannon shells were used, and the control surfaces in particular tended to disintegrate easily. Following this, the new Yakovlev Yak-3 fighter, which appeared by late 1944, was superior to the Messerschmitt Bf.109 and the later and faster Focke-Wulf Fw.190 below 11,000 feet, and to the Bf.109 at almost any altitude, but, in common with most Russian fighters of the day, it performed best at lower altitudes and showed marked performance deterioration at 20,000 feet. The early SB-2 light bomber of 1941 was easy prey for the Luftwaffe, but the Pe-2 which followed in 1942 was a fine aircraft, able to gain speed rapidly in a dive and difficult to shoot down. The I1-4 light bomber and Tupolev Tu-2 dive-bomber aircraft were also improvements on earlier Soviet aircraft. Most important of all, the Soviet Union depended heavily on the aircraft which it received from Britain and the United States, with the latter providing no fewer than 15,000 aircraft during the war years. For the Russian campaign, the Luftwaffe moved 2,000 aircraft to the east, with these being deployed into thirty bomber groups and nine dive-bomber groups, while another twenty groups operated single- engined fighters; there were also two groups each of close-support aircraft and twin-engined fighters, as well as five air-transport groups with just 150 aircraft, and a number of liaison and long-range reconnais- sance operations. Another 700 aircraft were manned by the Luftwaffe but under Army control, m
