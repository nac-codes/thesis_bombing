Milch, Goering's deputy, had had the foresight to order winter clothing for the Luftwaffe, appreciating the severe condi- tions which would overtake even an occupation force, let alone one left in the field. Yet keeping the aircraft operational was a difficult matter, and even lighting fires below the engines before starting did not always prove successful, while guns and controls often froze as well. By 19 December the German advance had not merely stalled: the front was in danger of collapsing. A month earlier, the 2nd Air Fleet had been redeployed from Smolensk to the Mediterranean for a renewed assault on Malta. The reasons for this were not hard to find, for by September 1941 the British air and naval forces on the island had sunk 38.5 per cent of the Afrika Korps' supplies, rising to 63 per cent in October and 77 per cent in November, but thanks to the 2nd Air Fleet this was reduced to 20 per cent by January 1942. By May 1942 once again all warships had been withdrawn from Malta. The pressure on the Luftwaffe by this time was such that the response of the leadership was not to make the most of the stranglehold on Malta but to transfer units back to the Eastern Front.
