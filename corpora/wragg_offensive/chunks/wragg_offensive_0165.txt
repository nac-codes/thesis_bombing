used this brief respite  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 112 113 BLITZKRIEG to reorganize, possibly forming itself into two organizations, one for tactical operations in support of and working closely with the ground forces, the other for the strategic role, but failed to do so. On the industrial front, in spite of increasing pressure from British air raids, which was to continue in 1942, the pre-occupation with the Eastern Front was to prove fatal, with factories churning out Ju. 87 Stuka dive-bombers instead of fighters. Eventually a retreat from Moscow was permitted, with German troops soon becoming surrounded at Demyansk in February 1942, with 100,000 men cut off and Hitler again refusing them permission to break out to the rear. Instead an air supply mission was mounted, with 262 Junkers Ju.52/3ms and their instructor crews being lost in this operation. When senior officers protested at the cost of this interruption to the training programme and stressed the shortage of bomber crews, they were told to win the war first and then worry about training. The cost of the Russian campaign was rising and was to rise still further. The failure to take Stalingrad during the second summer of the invasion resulted in 300,000 German and other Axis troops being surrounded at Stalingrad. Another re-supply operation was ordered from the Luftwaffe, with 500 aircraft deployed, of which little more than half were Ju.52/3m transports, and almost half consisting of bombers, with insufficient containers of the type which would have made the best use of their bomb-bay space on supply missions. Instead of lifting the 1,500 tons of supplies required daily by the beleaguered troops, the best that could be done was 289 tons on 19 December 1942, and the average during the last two months of the operation was less than one hundred tons. Seldom were more than thirty per cent of the aircraft available for supply operations, such were the difficulties of flying in the Russian winter. In the end, 94,000
