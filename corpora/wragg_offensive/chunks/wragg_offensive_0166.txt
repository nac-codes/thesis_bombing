In the end, 94,000 German and Italian troops were taken prisoner on 2 February 1943, leaving twice that number dead. For the Luftwaffe, the period from 24 November 1942 to 2 February 1943 saw the loss of 266 Junkers Ju.52/3ms, 42 Junkers Ju.86s, 165 Heinkel He.111s, five of the still rare Heinkel He.177s, a single Ju.290 transport and a number of Focke-Wulf Fw.200s, as well as a thousand men.

Well before this, on 27 September, a tripartite Pact had been signed by Japan, Germany and Italy, although the Japanese had also been careful to sign a Russo- Japanese Neutrality Pact on 13 April 1941, safeguarding Japan from a Russian attack.
