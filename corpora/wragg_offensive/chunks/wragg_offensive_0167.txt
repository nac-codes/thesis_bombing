Pacific. With unquestionable logic, the Japanese decided that a major pre-emptive blow was necessary to reduce the US forces in the Pacific to a manageable size. The main United States Navy base in the Pacific was at Pearl Harbor. On the night of 6-7 December 1941, Vice-Admiral Nagumo approached the base through a bad-weather zone, escaping detection, with the aircraft-carriers Akagi, Kaga, Hiryu, Soryu, Shokaku and Zuikaku, protected by two battleships, three cruisers and a force of destroyers. The carrier force carried 432 aircraft. Unknown to the Japanese, the mainstay of the United States Pacific Fleet, the three aircraft-carriers, uss Lexington, Saratoga and Enterprise, had been kept at sea on exercises. The Japanese had been inspired by the British attack on the Italian base at Taranto, but while many American naval officers of the period had an unreasoning jealousy towards the Royal Navy, this attitude was not universal, and there were those who feared just such an attack as the Japanese were about to launch, in advance of their formal declaration of war on the United States. Before dawn on 7 December 350 Japanese aircraft took off from the aircraft-carriers and flew to Pearl Harbor - a radar operator mistook their formation for a flock of birds. Their early morning attack blew up the uss Arizona and sank the battleships uss Oklahoma, California, Virginia and Nevada, while many smaller vessels were blown up or sunk. (The last three of the battleships sank on an even keel and were later refloated.) Shore installations and aircraft at the USN's shore station and the USAAF base were also destroyed. All this for the loss of just twenty-three Japanese aircraft. The operation has generally been regarded as a strategic error. The base was never rendered untenable, unlike Taranto, and the shore installations were not sufficiently damaged. Three days later the British battleship HMS Prince of Wales and the battle-cruiser HMS Repulse, under Rear-Admiral Phillips, were
