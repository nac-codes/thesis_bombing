There was little comfort to be gained from the knowledge that the German advance in the Soviet Union had been stalled, as much by the severity of the climate and by over-extended supply lines as by Soviet resistance, at Stalingrad. While few could have much confidence in German success, it still required optimism to foresee defeat for forces which had not known a serious setback. If Germany's ability to subjugate Russia was in doubt, so too was the ability of the Soviet Union to defend herself, given the disadvantages of a poor infrastructure and backward industry, scant raw materials and fuel, and armed forces which had been subjected to a series of ruthless purges during the years immediately preceding the outbreak of war. Worse still, the entry of the United States into the war offered some new opportunities for the Germans. The most obvious of these was the renewal of the U-boat campaign, which had been showing diminishing success during 1941 as British convoy protection improved, aided by more escort vessels fitted with ASDIC, more extensive maritime- reconnaissance patrols and the use of aircraft-carriers to protect convoys. Once America entered the war, the U-boats were free to raid inside American coastal waters, attacking coastal shipping and ships assem- bling into convoys ready for the transatlantic crossing. It took some time before the United States Navy and Coast Guard Service could instigate  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 116 THE BOMBER OFFENSIVE a convoy system for coastal shipping - or perhaps 'would' is more accurate. Too many USN officers regarded the Royal Navy with jealousy and ignored the hard-won British experience of the first few years of war. British coastal shipping was operated in convoys, and warships protected the fishing fleets as far as possible, although even so the English Channel was almost completely closed to merchant shipping because of the risk of German air attack and of raids by fast torpedo boats.
