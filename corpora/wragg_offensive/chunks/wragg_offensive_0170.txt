although even so the English Channel was almost completely closed to merchant shipping because of the risk of German air attack and of raids by fast torpedo boats. The only benefit to the Allies of the renewed U-boat campaign was that it enabled the Germans to continue in their belief in this mode of warfare, so that scarce men and scant resources were diverted into the U-boat campaign and the need for a balanced fleet or naval airpower could be conveniently overlooked until it was too late. One of the many disadvantages of the FÃ¼hrer system was that it encouraged the leaders of the armed forces to seek easy victories to justify themselves, rather than face the facts. In this instance, it enabled the new head of the Kriegsmarine, Grossadmiral Donitz, to undermine the position of his rival, Herman Goering, showing that the German Navy could continue to provide success while the Luftwaffe's reputation was tarnished by the failure to provide effective defence of the Father- land, and the cost of the re-supply operation at Demyansk. On the other hand, the renewed effectiveness of the U-boat campaign made the planning of a long-term and systematic bomber campaign more difficult, as aircraft were diverted to raids on naval targets or to reinforcing Coastal Command units engaged in the search for U-boats travelling to or from their hunting-grounds. In spite of the many setbacks and the absence of any immediate sign that the tide was turning, 1942 saw a sea change in the fortunes of the opposing sides. The Germans would not really see the signs of defeat until 1943, but the initiative was to pass to the Allies as 1942 advanced and new strategies and tactics came into play. The drawing of the United States into the war was to prove to be one of the greatest historical miscalculations, and the eventual undoing of the Axis powers, who in reality were already over extended. The renewal of the U-boat campaign reinforced the role of the bomber as the only means of striking back
