tandard RAF hangar with its maximum door clearance of 100 feet. The best wingspan that could be hoped for was 99 feet 10 inches, which must have called for some skill on the part of groundcrews. The successful contender for the  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 118 THE BOMBER OFFENSIVE specification came from Short Brothers, the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber. By the standards of 1936, the Stirling was impressive, capable of 270 mph and up to 14,000 lbs of bombs, with its eight-man crew providing an effective defence against enemy fighters, with a power- operated turret in the nose and in the dorsal position, and a tail turret, the latter having four .303 machine-guns compared with the twin .303s in the other two positions. The aircraft had its limitations, the most serious of which was the division of the bomb bay into three cells, due in part to the mid-wing configuration adopted which made a single long bomb bay impossible. As the war progressed and 4,000-lb bombs became commonplace, the Stirling could not accommodate them, even though in theory the load was within the capabilities of its four 1,600-hp Bristol Hercules radial engines. Inevitably, as the war progressed, Stirlings were relegated to maritime reconnaissance, along with many Wellingtons, and to glider-towing duties. One should not judge the first British heavy bomber too harshly, for its defects were the penalty of being first, becoming operational with the RAF in February 1941, with its first major raid over Berlin, on 17 April. The technical difficulties of designing a heavy bomber during the late 1930s should not be under-estimated: the surprise was that so much that was useful was achieved, rather than the problems which lay along the way. A contemporary of the Stirling was the Handley Page Halifax, which originated in Air Ministry Specification P13/36, intended to make the most of the new Rolls-Royce Vulture engines - 1,750 hp each and essentially 'X' engines incorporating components from two Rolls-Royce
