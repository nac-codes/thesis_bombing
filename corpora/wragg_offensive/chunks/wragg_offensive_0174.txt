ginated in Air Ministry Specification P13/36, intended to make the most of the new Rolls-Royce Vulture engines - 1,750 hp each and essentially 'X' engines incorporating components from two Rolls-Royce Peregrine V-12 engines. Two prototype H.P.56 bombers were ordered by the Air Ministry, but Handley Page's Chief Designer, G. R. Volkert, was soon aware of the shortcomings of the Vultures and took the initiative of redesigning the aircraft to use four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, sug- gesting to the Air Ministry that the change was a precaution against a shortage of Vultures! The change also meant that the original 26,300-lb H.P.56 became the 40,000-lb H.P.57. In spite of a number of handling problems, an initial hundred Halifaxes were ordered after a first flight by the prototype in October 1939, with the first flight by a production aircraft being in October 1940. The maximum take-off weight of the aircraft was a then staggering 55,000 lbs, in spite of having an even shorter wingspan than the Stirling, at 98 feet 10 inches. The big advance of this high-winged bomber was a 22-foot-long bomb bay, with additional bomb cells in the wings between the fuselage and the inboard engines. The first raid by Halifaxes came on 10-11 March 1941, when six aircraft from No. 35 squadron raided Le Havre in Normandy. Had the Halifax been faithful to its original specification, its competitor would have been the Avro Manchester, built to the same specification but without the changes enjoyed by the Handley Page aircraft. The Avro 119 Manchester made its first flight as Avro Type 679 on 24 July 1939, remaining airborne for just seventeen minutes, during which it was decided that the aircraft lacked directional stability and that the Vulture engines were not producing anything like 1,750 hp. A third fin to the original twin-fin tailplane cured the stability problem, and 200 aircraft were ordered into production, the first being delivered to the RAF on 1 November 1940, serving with 207 squa
