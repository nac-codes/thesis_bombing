third fin to the original twin-fin tailplane cured the stability problem, and 200 aircraft were ordered into production, the first being delivered to the RAF on 1 November 1940, serving with 207 squadron. Operational availability of the aircraft and its troublesome Vultures was poor, and 207 squadron did well to keep four of its original six aircraft in operation. The aircraft, even when available, could not meet its specification, which called for the warload to be up to 12,000 lbs, instead of its 8,100 lbs over a range of 1,630 miles, or 10,000 lbs over 1,200 miles. The only major operation for the aircraft came when six of 207 squadron's planes joined Handley Page Hampdens for a raid on the heavy cruiser Hipper, lying at Brest. Although all six aircraft survived the raid, two force-landed back in England. The loss rate for the Manchesters with the six Bomber Command squadrons so equipped was soon proving unacceptably high. The poor performance of the Manchester almost condemned Avro to building Halifaxes, but fortunately both for the company and for the RAF, after considering Bristol Centaurus and Napier Sabre engines as alternatives, Avro decided to offer an alternative based on four Rolls- Royce Merlin engines, the same formula which had saved the Halifax. After conversion of a standard Manchester airframe as the Manchester Mk.III, this was first flown in January 1941. Re-designated the Avro Type 683, the name Lancaster was chosen to avoid confusion with the ill-starred Manchester, with which the early Lancasters shared eighty per cent commonality in airframe components. In the Lancaster, four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines of 1,280 hp apiece provided a 60,000-lb take-off weight, a maximum speed of 287 mph at 11,500 feet, although the ceiling was 24,500 feet, and a range with a 14,000-lb bombload of 1,660 miles at 210 mph. In contrast to its rivals, the Lancaster was designed from the outset to drop a 4,000-lb bomb, but before the end of the war first the 12,000-l
