ccupied territory soon resulted in a much reduced warload, as little as 4,000 lbs on the B-17, and 8,000 lbs on the B-24, compared with 14,000 lbs on their British rivals, which, in the case of the Lancaster, was often exceeded. Rarely did the B-24 Liberator manage to operate with the 20,000-lb bombload originally anticipated. Not that the middle and later periods of World War II were the sole preserve of the heavy bomber: medium and even light bombers continued to have a role to play. These aircraft were far more man≈ìuvr- able than their heavier counterparts and were ideal for many precision bombing raids over heavily defended territory, or for path-finder duties. They could use runways unsuitable for heavy bombers, either increasing the number of bases available and avoiding saturation at the main bomber stations or providing much-needed tactical support in North Africa and in Europe after the landings in Italy, Normandy and the South of France, following the advancing armies and fitting into newly occupied bases. The many demands on the United States Army Air Force did not prevent the creation of the United States Middle East Air Force, which operated alongside Royal Air Force units in that theatre from November 1942 onwards. After the Allied landings in North Africa, the USMEF was joined by the USAAF's 12th Air Force, which by February 1943 had 1,250 aircraft of all types, operating alongside the RAF in the Anglo-US North African Air Force under the command of General Spatz, USAAF. The strategic elements in NAAF were provided by the USAAF 12th Air Force under General 'Jimmy' Doolittle, USAAF, while the tactical element consisted mainly of the RAF units and other Allied squadrons under the command of Air Vice-Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham, RAF. NAAF operated sixteen squadrons of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers, as well as eight squadrons of North American B-25 Mitchells and twelve squadrons of Martin B-26 Marauders, while there were Lockheed P-2 Lightnings for
