ur 500-1b bombs at up to 380 mph or 40,000 feet, with a 300-mph cruising speed providing a maximum range with maximum load of 1,370 miles. No fewer than 7,787 of these fine aircraft were built. At the outbreak of war, the main USAAF medium bomber was the Douglas B-18, based on the aerodynamic surfaces of the Douglas DC-2 airliner, the immediate predecessor of the DC-3 or C-47. After the war began, the B-18 squadrons started to be replaced by B-17s, as well as by North American B-25 Mitchells and Martin B-26 Marauders, both of which were put into production before the first flight of the prototype, the United States Government realizing that, even if the US managed, against all odds, to keep out of World War II, aircraft would still be needed for the RAF. The B-25 Mitchell first flew on 19 August 1940, powered by two 1,700-hp Wright R-2600 engines and with a crew of six. While the take-off weight of the aircraft rose from 27,000 lbs on the B-25A to 35,000 lbs on the B-25J, the warload on the final version was still just 3,000 lbs. Even so, 11,000 of these aircraft were built, with almost 10,000 for the USAAF and 800 for the RAF. The B-26 Marauder was designed to meet a USAAF requirement for a high-performance bomber, with a five-man crew and a 2,000-lb bombload, and 1,100 aircraft were ordered before the first flight on 25 November 1940. The original B-25A had two 1,850-hp Pratt & Whitney radial engines, while on the B-25B the power rating was raised to 1,920 hp, but the take-off weight was 36,500 lbs, giving the aircraft a high wing loading (the heaviest in USAAF service at that time), with consequent handling difficulties, especially for the less experienced pilots. The wing-loading increased still further on later models, rising far more quickly than the warload. A contemporary of these designs was the Martin 167 Maryland, origi- nally ordered before the fall of France for the Arm√©e de l'Air and delivered instead to the RAF, which eventually received 300, with twi
