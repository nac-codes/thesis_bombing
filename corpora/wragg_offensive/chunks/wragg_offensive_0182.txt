first significant step away from the sextant and chronometer, more suited to maritime use than to that of aerial navigation at night, was the system known as 'Gee', after 'G for Grid'. The navigator of the bomber would have a Gee grid overprinted on his charts, taking references from a cathode ray tube which picked up signals sent by a ground station in the UK; the basis of the system lay in the difference in time taken by the signals to reach the aircraft. Although accuracy and range depended on a number of features, generally the range was between 300 and 400 miles, which was sufficient for aircraft to reach the Ruhr, while accuracy varied between half a mile and five miles. Bomber Command were not complacent: receiving Gee early in 1942, they ex- pected some six months of Gee-assisted operations before the system was weakened by jamming, and in this assumption they were soon proved correct. Meanwhile the enemy concentrated on improving his night fighter defences. Later a further navigation and bombing aid was introduced, known as 'Oboe' because the noises produced by the system were likened to those from the musical instrument. One transmitting station in the UK would produce a signal which enabled the pilot to stay on course to his target, while a second warned him that he was about to overfly the target zone. Although early versions of this system had their limitations, some of the later developments made it possible for the ground operator to dictate the moment of release of bombs. Better still, however, was H2S, a crude radar device which made much of the different radar reflections of water, open country and built-up areas to produce what was almost a rolling map on a cathode ray tube. Effective though such systems were in improving the ability of Bomber Command to place ever heavier loads of bombs onto the target, the cost of manufacturing and installing such devices and the skill necessary to operate them efficiently persuaded Bomber Command of the need fo
