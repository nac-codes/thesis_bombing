to place ever heavier loads of bombs onto the target, the cost of manufacturing and installing such devices and the skill necessary to operate them efficiently persuaded Bomber Command of the need for a more acceptable target-marking system, with specially trained crews placing incendiaries or flares on the target in advance of the main bomber force. This worked so well that by the end of 1942 a specialized Pathfinder Force was established under the command of Air Commodore (later Air  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 124 THE BOMBER OFFENSIVE Vice-Marshal) D. C. T. Bennett. Another new concept developed as the war progressed was that of the 'master bomber', who would drop his own bombload on the target and then fly around within sight of the target and direct the following aircraft onto the target, something es- pecially useful if the early bombs had landed just off target or if the pattern of following bombers was such that their bombs fell further and further away from the target itself, stopping the raid from 'creeping back'. The role of the master bomber was hazardous in the extreme, especially as German anti-aircraft fire improved and the night fighter network developed, but there could be little doubting its effectiveness. The driving force behind this succession of aids had been a report prepared on the instructions of Churchill's Chief Scientific Adviser, Professor Lindemann - Lord Cherwell as he was to become - which discovered that, of the RAF aircraft recorded as having reached their target, only a third had managed to come within five miles of it. Such a damning criticism could have stopped the bomber effort but instead it provided the momentum for the necessary improvements. The first Pathfinder units had been formed in spite of the resistance of the Air Staff to the idea, which it was thought could warn the enemy of an impending raid and jeopardize the safety of the hundreds of bombers which would follow the Pathfinders. However, such massive raids did alert the
