ations. The Freya stations were a somewhat less effective counterpart of the British Chain Home system, providing early warning and certain basic details of the raid, but although scrambling the night fighters, the radar was not precise enough to guide them onto their targets. Freya was accompanied by Würzburg, which was in two parts, with a small version to direct master searchlight and anti-aircraft flak gunners, while a more powerful version known as the Würzburg Riese (Giant Würzburg) was able to detect aircraft at considerable range. One Würzburg radar would be assigned to a single night fighter, and the accuracy was sufficient to place the night fighter in the same grid square as the bomber it was seeking, an area about nine kilometres wide and eleven kilometres long, sufficiently close for the night fighter to home in on the target using its own radar. At the beginning of 1942 there were twenty-seven Kammhuber boxes, but by the end of 1943 the system was installed in considerable depth, with more than 200 boxes. However, by this time its peak of potency was passing, and the RAF already knew  126 THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON THE BOMBER OFFENSIVE most of its secrets as the result of intelligence work aided by electronic intelligence (ELINT) flights over enemy territory. The most effective form of counter-measures against the Kammhuber Line radar was the use of 'window', the term coined during World War II for what is now known as 'chaff', dropping black-painted aluminium strips, 26.5 cm long, half the length of the Würzburg radar pulses, and this effectively swamped the radar system by suggesting that each of the strips of aluminium represented a single bomber. 'Window' was so simple, yet so effective, that its use was delayed for a year for fear of giving the Germans an effective counter-measure to use against the British night fighter network. Ironically, the Germans already possessed this ability with 'Duppel', which they also delayed issuing to their own bomber for
