The prospect of something better came with the arrival of the first Lancasters in March. There was no great difference in the attitude of Harris and Peirse to their roles. It is often said that Peirse advocated area bombing, while Harris actually implemented the campaign. This is to jump ahead a little, 127 however, since the real problem lay not with the senior officers charged with responsibility for fighting the war but with their political overlords.

In March 1941 the direction to seek primary targets in oil production, dating from November 1940, was changed, with the RAF being once again re-directed to give priority to destroying submarines and long- range maritime reconnaissance aircraft, with occasional diversions to attack the shipyards building submarines and warships. This was almost a return to the orders of 1939.
