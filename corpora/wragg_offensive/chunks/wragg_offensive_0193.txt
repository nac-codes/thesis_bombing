he strike version is known as the IDS, or GR.1 to the RAF. This one has four 1,000-lb bombs under the fuselage, and long-range fuel tanks under the wings. The main elements in the Strategic Air Command during the late 1980s and 1990s will be the new Rockwell International B-1B bomber and the General Dynamics F-111B, seen here ready to act as a chase plane while a B-1B prototype takes-off on a test flight. through the haze that they dazzled the bomb-aimers. Later hooded flares were developed to prevent this happening. Nevertheless, this was an encouraging start. Essen was not alone, and nor were all of the raids concentrated on the Ruhr. On the night of 12-13 March a force of fifty-three Wellingtons raided the naval base of Kiel, operating at the extreme limit of the Gee range but managing to cause considerable damage.
