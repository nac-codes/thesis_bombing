rtance; if they can be continued for weeks, they might conceivably have a demoralizing effect on the population'. Of course, this was just what the War Cabinet and the Air Staff hoped for. Yet seldom were bombers allowed to range over the same targets for long enough to see whether the concept really did work in this way. After three or four nights of hell, time would come for rebuilding both the town in which the civilian population lived and worked and their own inner reserves. While it may have been foolish for the Air Staff to believe that German civilian morale was more likely to break than that of the British, who had weathered the Blitz, other factors came into play: at first the lack of continuity, and later the need to continue fighting for fear of the even greater horror, Soviet occupation. The policy of unconditional surrender, laid down by the Allies in 1943, may have done much to keep the war going in spite of a deteriorating position on all fronts. Weather also offered a respite, both for the civilians and for the bomber crews, and after the successes and high efforts of March bad weather and the limitations of Gee meant that there were few raids of importance during April. There were successful raids on Kiel and Cologne, as well as a virtual repeat of the LÃ¼beck raid on the port of Rostok by 168 bombers, damaging the Heinkel aircraft factory and destroying seventy per cent of the old town. Yet, even with Gee, the loss rate to the RAF remained high, with twelve aircraft being lost on the Rostok raid, an attrition rate of seven per cent.  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 130 THE BOMBER OFFENSIVE The main thrust of RAF bombing was by this time centred around night raids, but the occasional daylight raid was an inescapable necessity. In seeking a neat means of reducing the production of U-boats, it was decided to raid the MAN engine works at Augsburg, in southern Germany, well beyond the range of Gee. The need for accuracy entailed a daylight operation, using twelve
