types which had been retired from bombing duties. The use of aircrew from the OCUs was a weakness, since at this relatively advanced stage of the war it was already recognized that the more experienced air crew had the greatest chance of survival. The risk was that of jeopardizing the future's aircrew for an all-out effort on one night - similar to the Luftwaffe High Command's disruption of the training programme by diverting instructors to re-supply operations on the Eastern Front, replying to protests by saying that the war should be won first, and then attention could be paid to training. Winston Churchill's imagination had been captured by Harris's advocacy of a thousand-bomber raid, known to the Air Staff as the 'Millennium'. The first of these massive raids was set for the night of 30-31 May 1942, with Cologne marked as the target, chosen because the city was well within the range of Gee and easy to identify because of its position 131 on the Rhine. While Air Marshal Joubart placed 250 bombers from Coastal Command at the disposal of Harris, relatively few of these were needed in the end, with 367 aircraft available from the training units. The use of Gee and an improvised Pathfinder Force, as well as proximity to the Rhine, meant that less importance was attached to good visibility over the target than at the fifty-two airfields used for the raids in England. As well as the Lancasters, Stirlings, Halifaxes and Wellingtons which now formed the backbone of Bomber Command, Manchesters were also assigned to the operation, and so were the few remaining Handley Page Hampdens, while Whitleys, which had made their 'last' operational sortie over Ostend a month earlier, were brought out of their working retirement as parachute transports and glider tugs. The figure of a thousand aircraft was far from being a rounding-up exercise; the reverse was true, with 1,050 aircraft deployed on this first raid. Although bad weather had delayed the raid from the night of 27-28 May a
