could the disruption to the training programme, a case of consuming tomorrow's seed, be long endured. Already, the RAF had reduced bomber aircrew by having just one pilot for each bomber, although navigators were sometimes given sufficient training to hold the aircraft steady while the crew baled out should the pilot be incapacitated. There was one final, and successful, thousand-bomber raid on the night of 25-26 June, when in poor weather 1,006 bombers raided Bremen. Accurate flare-dropping on and around the Focke-Wulf factory resulted in considerable damage, but the losses were also higher on this occasion, with some five per cent of the aircraft, forty-nine, including twenty-one out of the 272 OTU aircraft, failing to return. Not that Bomber Command saw itself as being purely in the business of area bombing. There were other ways of attacking a prime target and other ways of undermining German morale, even if these opportunities required highly trained crews and presented themselves just occasion- ally. The new Mosquito was being delivered at a high rate, due not just to the easier materials availability which this aircraft's use of non-strategic materials permitted but to the way in which it was manufactured, being built in two halves, with 'plumbing' and other items fitted before the two halves were joined. While the new Pathfinder units and reconnaissance units received priority, bomber units also became available. In September came a successful daylight attack on the Gestapo headquarters in Oslo, with Mosquitos from No.105 squadron flying at roof-top height. Four months 133 later, on 31 January 1943, aircraft from this same squadron made a late morning attack on Berlin, timed to coincide with a large ceremonial parade being inspected by Reichsmarschall Goering, the head of the Luftwaffe, which was disrupted most successfully. If this humiliation of the Luftwaffe was not enough, that afternoon Mosquitos from No. 139 squadron were unwelcome guests at a large N
