long flights over the Reich. As the RAF had already discovered, the Norden bombsight was of limited use in European skies. That said, the USAAF insistence on daylight bombing avoided some of the delays which would have occurred in starting the campaign had night bombing, with the extra training necessary, been decided upon. Had both the RAF and the USAAF been involved in night bombing, there could have been congestion over the target areas at busy periods, although fighter defences would certainly have been overwhelmed. Most important, the pattern of RAF raids by night and USAAF raids by day on key targets meant not only that was the damage increased but that there was a cumulative effect as anti-aircraft defences and the population as a whole failed to cope with the round-the-clock destruction. Nor were the Germans able to concentrate resources on building just night or just day fighters; they had to do both. The USAAF did not raid Germany itself until 27 January 1943, when an attack on Wilhelmshaven did little damage but they lost two aircraft. The USAAF aircrew accounted for seven Luftwaffe fighters, although in the confusion of the battle, with many shooting at and claiming the same fighter as a 'kill', the initial claim was to have shot down twenty-two Luftwaffe aircraft. The weaknesses of the B-17 and B-24 armaments were soon apparent. During August 1943, out of 376 aircraft raiding the Messerschmitt plant at Regensburg and the ballbearing works at Schweinfurt, sixty were lost, while forty-five were lost in a raid over Stuttgart, and another sixty when Schweinfurt was raided for a second time, out of 291 aircraft on the mission. The start of 1943 saw Bomber Command with 839 operational aircraft, of which more than half were the 'heavies'. The Ruhr continued to enjoy priority, and during the year the RAF started to use the 8,000-lb 'double cookie' blast-bomb, and Oboe reinforced the failing effectiveness of Gee. While there were to be no thousand-bomber raids,
