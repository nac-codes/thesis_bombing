and by implication extended them to cover the 8th USAAF. It was at Casablanca that the policy of unconditional surrender was agreed upon. In spite of the success of the attack on the Ruhr Dams, 1943 is best remembered for the raids on Hamburg, in which the RAF and the USAAF took turns by night and by day to destroy the city, a major port, shipbuilding and industrial centre, in 'Operation Gomorrah'. The main attraction of Hamburg was, of course, the U-boat base, but there were more than 3,000 factories in and around the city, and an oil-refinery. For the raids the RAF used Gee in most of its aircraft, but the Pathfinders and many of the other aircraft had H2S. The location of the city, on the coast and on the River Elbe, made accurate navigation easier as well. The first of the successive raids on Hamburg came on the night of 24-25 July 1943, with more than 740 Bomber Command aircraft dropping 2,396 tons of high explosives and tens of thousands of incendiary bombs between 01.02 and 01.45, for the loss of twelve aircraft, approximately 1.5 per cent of the attacking force (in fact, these losses were a single Wellington, three Stirlings and four each of Halifaxes and Lancasters). Thirty minutes after the raid started, the fires could be seen by the approaching bomber waves, with smoke already at 12,000 feet, and buffeting from the heat of the fires at 18,500 feet. The following day, when the 8th USAAF arrived heavy smoke made precision bombing impossible.  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 136 THE BOMBER OFFENSIVE There was no RAF raid on the night of 26-27 July, and when 300 USAAF aircraft set out to bomb Hamburg on the 27th, all but fifty-three of them were recalled due to bad weather and the danger of bombers colliding in the heavy smoke pall, in addition to heavy losses from the defences which had shot nineteen B-17s on the 26th. Even so, the small force attacking Hamburg destroyed the power station at Neuhoff. On the night of 27-28 July 722 RAF aircraft dropped 2,417 tons of bo
