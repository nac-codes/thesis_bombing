On the night of 27-28 July 722 RAF aircraft dropped 2,417 tons of bombs from 00.57 onwards, dropping 'window' to confuse the defences and losing just seventeen aircraft, a loss rate of 2.4 per cent. Within ten minutes of the raid starting, a firestorm developed, destroying the north-east section of the old town. The night of 29-30 July saw yet another raid, with a fourth raid on 2-3 August, in which only Lancasters could be used due to poor weather over the target.

In a week, the RAF and the USAAF had achieved the totals which it had taken the Luftwaffe three years of war to inflict upon the UK.

This declaration, while containing some element of truth, nevertheless has to be taken with some regard for its origin.
