spite of the difficulties and without seeing the target, the entire raid took no more than forty minutes. The greater rate of delivery of bombs by the RAF at this period of the war was a major element in accurate bomb-aiming, not allowing time for the original fires or flares to disappear, and reduce the tendency for raids to 'creep away' from the target. On this occasion, in spite of the difficulties, more than a hundred factories, including those of Siemens, the electrical giant, the gasworks and a power station, as well as five railway depots, were all hit, with dense smoke rising to a height of 30,000 feet. Goebbels, almost by now a diarist of misfortune rather than a Minister of Propaganda, recorded that conditions in the city were 'pretty hopeless'. The bad weather hampered the night fighters, but those that did get airborne and survived heavy anti-aircraft fire managed to account for 6.2 per cent of all RAF heavy bombers engaged in the Battle of Berlin. The total damage inflicted during the Battle of Berlin over sixteen night raids amounted to more than four square miles of heavily built-up area razed, with some thirty per cent of industry ceasing production, while another ten per cent ceased to function as workers were evacuated, due in part to 1.5 million civilians being rendered homeless. Perhaps what is most surprising is that, in the first twelve raids, just 5,166 civilians were killed and another 18,431 injured. The USAAF was also at a strength by this time at which it too could overwhelm anti-aircraft defences, even on day raids, with, for example, 650 B-17s and B-24s raiding Brunswick on 11 January 1944. The USAAF also adopted many RAF techniques, including the use of dedicated pathfinding units, such as 482nd Group, which were equipped with H2S to enable them to find their targets in dense cloud. The combined RAF night and USAAF day raids, in which the air forces would co-operate and bring their combined resources to bear on the same target, was the
