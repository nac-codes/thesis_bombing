them to find their targets in dense cloud. The combined RAF night and USAAF day raids, in which the air forces would co-operate and bring their combined resources to bear on the same target, was the result of the 'Point Blank' directive. This approach had been operating throughout 1943 and continued into 1944, reaching a peak in the 'big week' of 19-25 February 1944, when the combined 8th USAAF and RAF bombing operations against Germany totalled more than 8,000 individual aircraft sorties, dropping 16,500 tons of bombs on Augsburg, Schweinfurt, Brunswick, Regensburg and other centres of the German aircraft industry. In spite of such a heavy raid, this was the year in which the German aircraft industry was to achieve its best production figures for the entire war, having been finally mobilized, but at the same time it was also something of a last all-out effort, almost as if industry was already in its death-throes, exhausting increasingly scarce components and raw materials of which production was harder to improvise than the actual assembly of the aircraft themselves. The same applied to other items of defence equipment, with production collapsing shortly after the start of 1945. While the Germans undoubtedly lost production and failed to match attrition, the concept of Anglo-American aerial supremacy could not be taken for granted. On 30-31 March 1944 the RAF suffered one of its heaviest loss rates of the bombing campaign, certainly the worst of a major raid late in the war, when 795 bombers raided Nuremburg. A loss rate of 13.6 per cent (94 bombers) was recorded on the raid, while another ten aircraft were written off by crash-landing at their bases in England. The overall loss was the worst of any night of World War II, and it is generally accepted that as many as eighty of the aircraft may have been shot down by night fighters, a means of defence more costly but more effective than anti-aircraft fire. The losses were in spite of a diversionary raid by Halifaxe
