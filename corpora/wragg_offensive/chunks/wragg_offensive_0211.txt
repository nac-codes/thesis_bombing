eighty of the aircraft may have been shot down by night fighters, a means of defence more costly but more effective than anti-aircraft fire. The losses were in spite of a diversionary raid by Halifaxes off Heligoland, which the Germans largely ignored, leaving the Nuremburg bombers running the gauntlet of night fighters all the way from Aachen to the target, and on the ground the flight path to the target for the later waves of bombers was clearly marked by burning aircraft. In spite of this, more than 700 of the bombers pressed home their attack, dropping more than 1,100 tons of high explosives and almost as much in incendiaries. In spite of the heavy losses, the raids continued until May 1944, when the major priority became the communications lines of northern France, which needed to be severed in advance of the Normandy landings and  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 140 THE BOMBER OFFENSIVE for which 'Point Blank' was effectively suspended. On one of the last raids before the switch to targets in France, Wing Commander (later Group Captain) Leonard Cheshire led 617 squadron on a precision raid in bad weather and at low level over Munich. In spite of his aircraft being hit by flak and having been caught in searchlights, he remained over the target for twelve minutes, acting as 'master bomber' and guiding the rest of his squadron onto the target. For this Cheshire was awarded the Victoria Cross. The raids over France provided the British and Americans with a major problem, and targets had to be carefully selected so as to avoid casualties among French civilians, a consideration at any time during the war but of especial importance before the invasion, when an all-out effort would be needed from the French Resistance. The attacks against railway lines and road and railway bridges, junctions and marshalling yards were designed to isolate northern France and make it difficult for reinforce- ments to be moved quickly to the front which would be established not too far inland of th
