radar, either by technical analysis or by other means. It was not until a night fighter landed by mistake, lost and out of fuel, at RAR Woodbridge in Suffolk, that the new radar was fully understood. Anten- 141 nae - known as Hirschgeweih (stags' antlers) to the Luftwaffe - were used for the new Lichtenstein SN2 radar, operating on 90 mHz and immune to 'window'. The RAF also discovered that the aircraft had two other radars. The first was FUG 227 Flensburg, which homed onto a new tail-mounted anti-fighter radar fitted to new RAF heavy bombers and known as 'Monica', picked up RAF aircraft at ranges of as much as forty-five miles; the other was the FUG 350 Naxos, which homed onto H2S. In addition to the new airborne radars, the Germans were also using a new ground-based radar known as Jagdschloss (hunting castle), which overcame many of the deficiencies of earlier German radars. To counter the new German radars, the RAF received a variation of 'window' known as 'rope'; 90 cm in length, it was known as 'angels' hair' to German children who found it on the morning after a heavy bombing raid. While this jammed the SN2 radar, the use of H2S was much reduced and the 'hunting castles' were bombed. Other examples of counter-measures used by the RAF as the war progressed included jamming enemy radar and communications fre- quencies, initially using noise-jamming alone, but later these techniques increased in sophistication, with German-speaking aircrew feeding con- tradictory instructions to Luftwaffe night-fighter pilots. When the Ger- mans made greater use of women to counter this, ground-based members of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force transmitted messages, with the bombers of No. 100 Group acting as relay stations. The technique became so successful that it was not unknown for WAAF and Luftwaffe control- lers to argue over who had the right to instruct the pilots of a hapless Luftwaffe night-fighter squadron! Of course, the Germans did not rely on radar alone. German inv
