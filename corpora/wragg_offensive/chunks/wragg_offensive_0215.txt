RAF's fast low-level light-bomber raids. Less fortunate was the Messerschmitt Me.262 jet fighter, an aircraft which was denied its true role due to Hitler's own intervention. German jet-fighter development, under the leadership of Pabst von Ohain, had been ahead of that of the British, who had tended to neglect the work of Whittle. The experimental Heinkel He.178 was test-flown in August 1939 and led to development of the Me.262. The shortage of strategic materials and confidence over success early in the war led to the project's neglect, but the fighter ace Adolf Galland was able to fly the aircraft in April and May 1943. Galland reported to Goering that the aircraft should be put into production as a fighter and that the new Me.209 be abandoned to allow this. It was suggested that, of the 4,000 fighters planned by Milch for 1944 1,000 should be Me.262s and most of the remainder Focke-Wulf Fw. 1905 or night fighters. Production was refused until Hitler saw the aircraft demonstrated, on 2 November 1943, when he insisted that the aircraft be developed as a bomber. Messerschmitt had planned a fighter-bomber variant of the basic airframe, capable of carrying a single 1,000-lb bomb or two 550-lb bombs, but the under-fuselage and under-wing bomb racks had not been designed, and in any case Messerschmitt were unable to meet their production targets for conventional fighter aircraft by this time. The twin Junkers Jumo turbojets could give the aircraft a speed of more than 500 mph, although range was limited on this, and on other early jet aircraft such as the Gloster Meteor. Attempts to get the bomber version into service in time for the Allied invasion failed, and eventually the aircraft was ordered into production as a fighter in August 1944. although the first did not join the Luftwaffe fighter squadrons until November. Plans for 500 Me.262s per month by December 1944 failed. with just 564 aircraft built during the entire year, although before produc- tion finally coll
