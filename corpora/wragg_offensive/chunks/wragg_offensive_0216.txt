the Luftwaffe fighter squadrons until November. Plans for 500 Me.262s per month by December 1944 failed. with just 564 aircraft built during the entire year, although before produc- tion finally collapsed in March 1945 another 740 were built. All of the aircraft had to be able to carry bombs in an emergency. Proof of the Me.262's neglected potential came when, in early 1945, one squadron. with just six of the aircraft serviceable, managed to shoot down forty-five Allied aircraft. Unusually for a jet aircraft, the early versions of the Me. 262 used a tailwheel landing-gear. The insistence on using the Me.262 as a bomber, with the consequent delay in aircraft reaching the fighter squadrons, with little attempt at serious bomber operations, is all the more difficult to understand because alone of all the combatants, the Luftwaffe had a light jet bomber available 143 to it. A high-wing aircraft with the twin jet engines slung under the wings, the Arado Ar.234 had been developed since 1941. The huge fuel-consumption meant that on the early development versions a retract- able under-carriage could not be fitted, and it was decided to use a trolley-and-skid system similar to that used for the Me.163. How- ever, before entering production the aircraft was re-designed to take a retractable under-carriage. Carrying up to 3,000 lbs of bombs externally, twin Junkers Jumo jet engines of 2,000-lbs thrust provided a maximum speed of 470 mph and an altitude of up to 30,000 feet. The aircraft was most successful as a reconnaissance aircraft, enter- ing service in September 1944. It was of limited use as a bomber, due largely to severe range limitations with a full warload, but as the Allies drew in around Germany, the aircraft was used, usually with single 2,205-lb bombs, against important communications targets such as the Remagen Bridge over the Rhine in March 1945. Shortages were such by the end of the war that just over 200 of these aircraft were completed. By the closing stage
