the A-4, was a more sophisticated weapon altogether and marked the beginning of the manned bomber's decline as the principal weapon of offensive warfare. Development-work on the  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 144 THE BOMBER OFFENSIVE rocket started in 1933 by Dr Wernher von Braun, initially as weapons for the German Army, with the missiles so developed being viewed more as a longer-range and heavier form of artillery than as a strategic weapon. Successive development models, the A-1, A-2 and A-3, resul- ted in the A-4, which originated as a project in 1936. A successful launching on 3 October 1942 led to production at Peenemunde, but after the successful Allied air raid of August 1943, production moved to an underground factory at Nordhausen, in the Harz Mountains, which eventually produced up to 900 missiles a month. The first launchings, on 6 September 1944, were against Paris, although the missiles blew up before reaching the French capital. On 8 September, raids started against Britain. The V-2 was a true strategic ballistic missile, flying outside the Earth's atmosphere before re-entry, providing no advance warning at all to its victims. The range was up to 200 miles, with a warhead of 2,000 lbs of high explosive. Unlike the V-1, which required a prepared launching platform, the V-2 could be launched from clearings in forests or other confined and improvised sites. Out of the 10,000 or so produced, almost 1,400 were fired against the British Isles, killing about 2,500 people, mainly in London and the south-east, and injuring another 6,000. A similar number were launched against Antwerp, while other targets in the Low Countries and France were also subjected to missile attack. Plans for extended-range versions and for a transatlantic version were stillborn as the war ended. As the war reached its end, targets and techniques changed yet again. The appeal of the 'panacea' targets returned, although this did at least reflect the growing crisis afflicting Germany, with atta
