As the war reached its end, targets and techniques changed yet again. The appeal of the 'panacea' targets returned, although this did at least reflect the growing crisis afflicting Germany, with attacks on synthetic oil-plants and oil-refineries, as supplies generally became scarcer and as the infrastructure crumbled, having far greater impact than would have been the case earlier in the war when the ability to recover was greater. The oil-production centres had been of prime concern to the RAF during 1940 and 1941, while the USAAF had also turned their attention to oil-production in August 1943, raiding the Ploesti oil-refineries thirty-five miles north of Bucharest, when 163 out of 177 Consolidated B-24 Libera- tors reached the target after taking off from Benghazi, but at the cost of fifty-four of the American bombers. Such a costly operation even against what ranked as one of the most important elements in the German war campaign could not be afforded easily. The situation was changing in the Allies' favour as the war progressed, however, and in April, May and June 1944 USAAF bombers again ranged over the oil-refineries, with greater success this time so that oil-production fell from 109,000 tons in August 1943 to 12,000 tons a year later. At this time, RAF Bomber Command came under renewed pressure to resume bombing raids against synthetic oil-production in the Ruhr, with Harris's objections overruled, so that before the end of September 1944 the RAF dropped 145 16,700 tons of high explosives, destroying much of the Ruhr's oil- production plant. The other reversal was the decision that the RAF should once again make daylight raids, although these were in addition to, not instead of, the night bombing. Starting in October 1944, the daylight raids were often led by Gee-H equipped Avro Lancasters of the Pathfinder Force, with special yellow bar tail markings. On 14 October 1,067 Lancasters and Halifaxes raided Duisburg in the Ruhr in broad daylight for the loss o
