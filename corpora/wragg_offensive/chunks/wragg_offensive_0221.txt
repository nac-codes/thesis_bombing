any surrender, unlikely to be forthcoming for as long as the Allies insisted on unconditional surrender and a subsequent partitioning of Germany, meant that the bomber offensive had to be maintained. Earlier experience had shown the cost of easing up or of switching to other targets, and while submarines were still being readied for operational patrols against Allied shipping, and men were still having to fight towards Berlin on the ground, a halt to the bomber campaign would have been hard to justify. It could even have prolonged the war by reducing the pressure on the Germans. Even those who saw defeat as inevitable argued for a fight to the end, with Luftwaffe personnel being forced to fight on foot against the Allied armies and being joined by Kriegsmarine personnel whose ships were trapped in port. There  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 146 THE BOMBER OFFENSIVE was no fuel for aircraft or ships, and the real tragedy of the bomber campaign is that towards the end it became an assault on cities which were defenceless and crowded with refugees. New equipment, the improved Gee-H and H2S Mk. III, enabled even more precise raids to be made against smaller targets and over longer ranges. In February the RAF bombed oil targets, seventeen times by day and twenty times by night, ranging as far east as Zeich in Czechoslovakia, dropping 62,000 tons of high explosives on oil targets by the end of the month. While oil-production fell by sixty-five per cent in the year to September 1944 and dropped to a trickle by the end of the year, the Luftwaffe managed for a few months to operate some missions on stored fuel - but this was all but exhausted by April 1944. The most controversial raid of the war was that mounted against Dresden, 'the German Florence', standing on the Elbe, not far from the frontier with Czechoslovakia and, in February 1945, not far from the advancing Soviet armies. The fear of the Russians had packed the city with refugees, not least because it was a focal point for
