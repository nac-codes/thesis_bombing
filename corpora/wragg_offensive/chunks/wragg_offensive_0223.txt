d achieve, or an essential attempt to finally cripple the German war effort and bring the fighting to an earlier end? Even those involved at the time cannot agree. After February 1945 the bomber offensive was effectively ended. Plans 147 were laid for bomber units to be transferred to the Far East to continue the war against Japan, using the development of the Lancaster, the Avro Lincoln, only just coming off the production line. There were other duties for Bomber Command as well, including 'Operation Manna', dropping food supplies to the German-occupied zone of the Netherlands, bypassed in the main Allied advance and with the civilian population starving after the Germans commandeered all food supplies. The opera- tion took place in April and May 1945, less than a month before the end of the war. Between September 1939 and May 1945, the RAF mounted 1,440,000 bomber sorties against German targets, dropping 2.7 million tons of bombs, with the combined USAAF and RAF bombing offensive account- ing for 305,000 German dead and 780,000 injured, according to the United States Strategic Bombing Survey post-war. The Luftwaffe lost 57,000 aircraft on the ground or shot down, com- pared with 18,000 USAAF and 22,000 RAF aircraft, with the latter includ- ing 8,525 aircraft from Bomber Command. The USAAF lost 78,265 personnel and the RAF 78,281 personnel in the war against Germany, with 47,268 of the RAF total coming from Bomber Command. It remains a matter of some controversy, and much resentment among those involved with the bomber campaign against Germany, that no campaign medal was ever struck for the men of Bomber Command, on the grounds that the UK was not a theatre of war and that for most of the war the majority of bomber crews were UK-based. While this was true, the operations night after night over heavily defended enemy territory with aircraft loss rates often ranging in excess of ten per cent, with the risk of death, injury or capture, should surely have justified a c
