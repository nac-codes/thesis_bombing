ns night after night over heavily defended enemy territory with aircraft loss rates often ranging in excess of ten per cent, with the risk of death, injury or capture, should surely have justified a campaign medal. As it is, the Bomber Command aircrew were left with nothing more than the 1939-45 medal, almost as if they had spent the war flying desks.  7 on1 149 RETRIBUTION Retribution It took some years of intensive warfare before the tide could be seen to turn against Germany, but in the Far East the limit to Japanese ambitions came much sooner after that country's entry into World War II. The paradox lies in the fact that it was not until comparatively late in the war that Japanese cities began to suffer the effect of strategic bombing, with the initial defeats for the Japanese being at sea, followed by a steady reversal of their territorial acquisitions, all of which were gained within a few months of the attack on the United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor. For the most part, the war in the Pacific was one for the aircraft-carrier rather than the strategic bomber. While there were many notable achieve- ments by the naval airmen of both sides, in many instances the use of naval aircraft reflected their replacing the guns of the fleet as the major instrument of battle between opposing fleets, suggesting that their use in any one battle was tactical rather than strategic. This was an over- simplification, since the overall use of naval aviation was a strategy in itself, and there were cases of naval aircraft striking against shore-based targets, as when the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm attacked Palembang, or indeed at Pearl Harbor itself, but there is something to be said for drawing a parallel between the operations of the USN and the RN in the Pacific and the work of the 2nd Allied Tactical Air Force in Europe. Distance alone, and the strength of Japanese sea power dictated that events should take this course. There was another reason why the strategic bomber
