k of the 2nd Allied Tactical Air Force in Europe. Distance alone, and the strength of Japanese sea power dictated that events should take this course. There was another reason why the strategic bomber was of limited importance for all but the last year of the war against Japan, and that was simply once again that the bomber was not cost-effective once battle could be joined with the enemy; in Europe, bombing missions were for long the main means of drawing the enemy into battle and sapping his strength. The Japanese advance through the Far East was faster than that which had been experienced in Europe. Sumatra was invaded on 14 February 1942, while Malaya and Singapore were already falling, and Burma was occupied the following month. It was not long before Java and the rest of the Indonesian archipelago followed, although the Japanese never managed to take all of New Guinea. The Japanese knew how to use carrier air power effectively, at least at first, for it was later to prove that, as with the Luftwaffe, the emphasis was on what amounted to a Blitzkrieg style of operation, and there were lessons to be learnt over maintaining a worthwhile defence and staving off defeat. As in Europe, the Allies were to learn the hardest lessons first, and then effectively apply what they had discovered. On 19 February Vice-Admiral Nagumo was able to mount a heavy aerial attack on Darwin in the Australian Northern Territory, using aircraft from the carriers Akagi, Kaga, Hiryu and Soryu, sinking eleven merchant vessels and an American destroyer. On 5 April the previous December's sinking of the British battleship HMS Prince of Wales and the battle-cruiser HMS Repulse was followed up with the sinking of the cruisers HMS Cornwall and Dorsetshire, using fifty carrier-borne fighter- bombers and torpedo-bombers. Eighty Japanese Naval Air Force bombers sank the small British aircraft carrier HMS Hermes on 9 April, as she steamed near Ceylon, itself the subject of heavy Japanese air raids.
