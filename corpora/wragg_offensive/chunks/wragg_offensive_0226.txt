and torpedo-bombers. Eighty Japanese Naval Air Force bombers sank the small British aircraft carrier HMS Hermes on 9 April, as she steamed near Ceylon, itself the subject of heavy Japanese air raids. The United States Navy lost its original aircraft-carrier, the uss Langley, to Japanese aerial attack in February, while ferrying aircraft from Aus- tralia to Java. As with the British in Europe, it soon became apparent that the early priority was an attack on Tokyo itself, both to boost American morale and to dent that of the Japanese. On 18 April 1942 sixteen USAAF North American B-25 Mitchell light bombers took off from the aircraft-carrier uss Hornet under the command of Colonel James Doolittle, to fly 700 miles to raid Tokyo. The aircraft could not return to the uss Hornet - 'landing-on' would have been impossible - but instead continued to USAAF bases in China. The effort was indeed a great morale-booster, but no worthwhile weight of bombs could be dropped, let alone targeted, and all the aircraft were destroyed on the ground while in China. None was shot down. By summer 1942 the USAAF had the 10th USAAF in India and Burma and the 14th USAAF in China, while the 5th USAAF was based in Australia. After the fall of Burma, the units in China had to be supplied by air 'over the hump' of the Himalayas. There was relatively little these units could do: there were a number of raids against Japanese cities, mainly from China, but these were of little real effect, and most of the attention was paid to supporting ground forces or to attacking Japanese shipping. The 14th USAAF in China was unable to check the Japanese advance until May 1945. For the most part, the operations of these units were primarily tactical in nature. Another air force, the 13th USAAF, supported operations after the invasion of the Solomon Islands in August 1942. Although priority was given to the war effort in Europe and North Africa, the USAAF air forces operating in the Far East and the Pacific also
