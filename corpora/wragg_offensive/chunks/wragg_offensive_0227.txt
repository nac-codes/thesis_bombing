after the invasion of the Solomon Islands in August 1942. Although priority was given to the war effort in Europe and North Africa, the USAAF air forces operating in the Far East and the Pacific also received Boeing B-17 Fortresses, Consolidated B-24 Liberators and North American B-25 Mitchell bombers, while the USN took the lead in  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 150 RETRIBUTION the island-hopping which was a feature of the advance by the Allies. The USN enjoyed a series of victories when the carrier fleets clashed. The first of these came in the Battle of the Coral Sea on 7 May 1942, staving off a Japanese invasion of Port Moresby in New Guinea, with seven torpedoes and eleven bombs from naval aircraft sinking the Japanese carrier Shoho within ten minutes, while later the uss Lexington was torpedoed by JNAF aircraft, blowing up some hours afterwards. While a diversionary Japanese fleet sought to make a spoof raid on the Aleutian Islands, off Alaska, on 3 June, USAAF Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers made an unsuccessful attack on a large Japanese carrier force approaching the Pacific island of Midway. In the Battle of Midway on 4 June, American and Japanese carrier fleets again clashed, and after an early unsatisfactory series of raids by both sides, aircraft from the uss Enterprise and Hornet caught the Japanese aircraft as they landed on their carriers, with the flightdecks cleared of readily available fighter aircraft. USN dive-bombers scored direct hits on the carriers Kaga, Soryu, Akagi and Hiryu, for the loss to Japanese attack of the uss Yorktown. From this decisive battle onwards, the Japanese Navy was on the defensive, retreating in the face of ever more confident and competent American naval air power. At Guadacanal, in the Solomons, a hastily constructed Allied airfield at Espiritu Sanctu, enabled USAAF, USN, USMC and Royal New Zealand Air Force aircraft to range over the islands, com- plementing the combined USN and Royal Navy forces at sea.
