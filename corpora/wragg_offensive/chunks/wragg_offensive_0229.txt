ainst the Japanese, the new kamikaze weapon was not to be treated lightly, with attacks reaching a peak in November 1944, with direct hits on the uss Intrepid, Franklin, Lexington, Essex, Hancock, Cabot and Belleau Wood. Before the war ended, three aircraft-carriers were to be sunk by the kamikaze, along with another thirty-one other vessels, while they were to damage thirty-six aircraft-carriers, fifteen battleships and more than 200 other ships. Gener- ally the suicide pilots would aim for one of the lifts on an aircraft-carrier, but many were shot down before reaching their target, and after the initial flood of volunteers was exhausted and subsequent pilots seem to have been 'persuaded' to join the force, it may even have been that many pilots were drunk on saki as they made their attack. The biggest weakness of the kamikaze raids, apart from the steady attrition of good pilots, especially during the early phase, was that the JNAF pilots in Admiral Onishi's force did not return to provide any feedback on their experiences. This, while seeming like an attempt at dark humour, was serious, since the JNAF was so convinced of the effectiveness of the tactic that it would send only one aircraft per target, but even if this reached the target, it often caused only slight damage; many believe that it would have taken at least four kamikaze aircraft, possibly six, to sink an aircraft-carrier. As it was, the successes were usually among the smaller, lightly built escort carriers, or among mer- chant ships. Coinciding with the start of the kamikaze campaign, the USAAF had prepared a base for bombers in the Marianas, ready for strategic bombing raids against Japan. The main instrument for these raids was a new heavy bomber, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. The B-29's development started in 1940, to meet a USAAF specification for a 'Hemisphere Defence Weapon', able to carry 2,000 lbs of bombs over 5,000 miles at a speed of 400 mph. The aircraft was to have considerable flexibi
