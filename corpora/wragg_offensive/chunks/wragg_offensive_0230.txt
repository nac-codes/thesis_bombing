started in 1940, to meet a USAAF specification for a 'Hemisphere Defence Weapon', able to carry 2,000 lbs of bombs over 5,000 miles at a speed of 400 mph. The aircraft was to have considerable flexibility in trading off range for bombload, which was to be as high as 16,000 lbs for shorter ranges. As with the B-17, a heavy defensive armament and armour was specified, as were self-sealing fuel tanks. The prototype XB-29 could lift 20,000 lbs of bombs, but its speed - 360 mph at 25,000 feet - was well below that specified. On the other hand, the aircraft undeniably had a heavy defensive armament, with four remotely controlled turrets, in nose, tail and dorsal and ventral positions, having twin 0.5-inch guns, except for the tail turret, which had three guns of this calibre, or a single 20-mm gun. The first orders were placed before the aircraft flew for the first time on 21 September 1942, powered by four 2,200-hp Wright R-3350 radial engines. It was clear that the aircraft would not be available in  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 152 RETRIBUTION quantity in time to fly against Germany and so, rather than disrupt the well-established pattern of attack against Germany, they were allocated exclusively to the offensive against Japan, hitherto delayed for the lack of an aircraft of suitable range. The B-29 started operations against Japan after 180 of these aircraft were moved into the new airfield in the Marianas in October 1944, with the first of a series of high-level daylight raids starting on 24 November 1944. The initial series of attacks was disappointing, and General Lemay, in command of the 20th USAAF Bomber Command, decided to switch to low-level night attacks, adopting the RAF tactic of mixing incendiaries with high-explosive bombs. On the night of 9-10 March 1945, 334 B-29s raided Tokyo, with a firestorm rapidly starting and being whipped by a gale along the wooden buildings of the residential and commercial areas. destroying forty per cent of the city and killing some 80
