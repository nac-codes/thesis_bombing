An island nation, Japan had been vulnerable to the Americans' increasingly effective use of the submarine and had failed to utilize this weapon efficiently in return. Japanese industrial might had never been a match for that of Germany, and Japanese inventiveness, for all of its sinister implications with such concepts as kamikaze, had not been adequate to 153 bring any significant new aircraft design into production and service during the war years, let alone the jet fighter aircraft which were the pride of the Luftwaffe and the Royal Air Force as the war ended. Indeed, the much-vaunted Zero proved a match for the American opposition for no more than a year after Pearl Harbor. The bombing campaign forced more than eight million Japanese to flee the cities and seek what refuge they could in the countryside with a daily ration cut to 1,500 calories per person. Yet, despite all these problems, surrender seemed even less likely than that of Germany. Millions of people still lived under Japanese occupation; many tens of thousands of Allied prisoners of war and civilian internees lived in conditions which were far more inhuman than those which had existed in Germany and which were made worse by the tropical conditions. In many islands even Japanese civilians committed suicide rather than accept defeat. The Allies, with great foreboding, put in hand preparations for the invasion of Japan, 'Operation Olympic', with an RAF 'Tiger Force' of heavy bombers, including the new Avro Lincoln.

In preparation, the Japanese allocated their remaining fuel, equipment and manpower reserves for a final kamikaze onslaught of 5,000 aircraft, many of them unsuitable second- line training or communications types, which w
