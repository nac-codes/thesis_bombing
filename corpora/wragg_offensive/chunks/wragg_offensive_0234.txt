n September 1944, at a time when it was just possible that nuclear weapons might be used against Germany. As German defeat became inevitable and Japanese resistance continued, the 509th was moved to Tinian Airfield in the Marianas in May 1945 and was ready to use nuclear weapons by 1 August. Few members of the Group knew the duty which lay ahead for it. On 6 August, at 02.45, the Group's Commanding Officer, Colonel Paul Tibbets, took off in his Boeing B-29 Superfortress, named Enola Gay, followed by two observation aircraft. On taking off, Tibbets did not know which of three Japanese cities was to be his target, and it was not until shortly after 07.00 that he was directed to Hiroshima, the city with the best weather that summer morning. At 08.15, at 31,600 feet, the U-235 atomic bomb known as Little Boy was released, exploding at 1,000 feet. The first use of an atomic bomb killed 78,000 people within seconds. injured another 51,000 and made 176,000 homeless, while more than 70,000 buildings were destroyed. Three days later, on 9 August, a second Boeing B-29, named Bock's Car after its captain, dropped another atomic bomb, while Japan's leaders debated Truman's call of 6 August to surrender or face a rain of ruin. The bomb dropped on Nagasaki was more powerful than that used at Hiroshima and was known as Fat Man, due to its shape which resulting from a different fission technique. It killed some 50,000 people, and injured some 10,000 more, a lower figure than for Hiroshima since Nagasaki's terrain afforded protection for many buildings in valleys whose steep slopes shielded them from the burst. The British had an observer in Bock's Car: Group Captain Leonard Cheshire VC, the former commander of 617 squadron. Preceded by a pillar of purple fire 10,000 feet high, with perfect symmetry, unlike a conventional explosive fireball, seemed to say to Cheshire, 'Against me, you cannot fight.'
