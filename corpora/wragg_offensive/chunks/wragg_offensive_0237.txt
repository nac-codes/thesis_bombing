ated, partly because of the need to maintain sizeable forces in occupation of Japan and Germany, and for the former colonial powers the need to re-establish their authority. The advent of new technology also meant that World War II aircraft were not, with a few exceptions, maintained in front-line units for long; the exceptions tended to be aircraft such as the Gloster Meteor jet fighter which were effectively of the new generation. Aircraft designed for eventualities which did not arise also entered service. The RAF had the Avro Lincoln heavy bomber, designed to carry the war home to the cities of Japan, as was the Royal Navy's new long-range fighter and fighter-bomber, the de Havilland Sea Hornet, an updated and streamlined development of the Mosquito. The Americans had an updated Superfortress in the Boeing B-50 Superfortress, but even more significant was the giant Convair B-36, designed to operate as a transatlantic-range bomber in the eventuality of Germany's successfully occupying the British Isles. The Convair B-36 was an anachronism, first flying in 1946 and not entering service with USAF squadrons until the late 1940s. Six Pratt & Whitney R-4360-35 radial engines of 3,800 hp apiece were capable of providing a maximum speed of 435 mph when boosted by four General Electric J47 turbojets, while range was 5,000 miles with a 10,000-lb warload, though this was still less than that of a British heavy bomber. The B-50 and the B-36 were both used in trials with composite aircraft, carrying fighters, either as a possible means of defence over occupied territory or to enable fighters to be 'on patrol' for longer periods than would otherwise have been possible. The short range of the early jet fighters lent urgency to this technique, but in the end the best solution lay in in-flight refuelling of fighter aircraft, and for this many B-50s were converted to KB-50 tankers, with General Electric J47 engines augmenting their four 3,800-hp Wright radial engines. The tanker
