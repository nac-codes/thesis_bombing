ct conflict between the two sides avoided by a policy of deterrence and what has also become known as Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD), based on the availability of nuclear weapons. MAD became the policy by which neither side dared start a conflict for fear of rapid escalation into a nuclear exchange, which would result in both sides being wiped out. In delivering the warheads, first the bomber and then the missile became the key. The ability to deploy such weapons, the ability to ensure their delivery, and the determination to use these if necessary became known as 'the policy of deterrence' An element within deterrence became known as 'the second strike capability', meaning that the nation on the receiving end of a nuclear attack could retaliate, denying its opponent victory. For this, submarine- launched missiles became increasingly important, displacing the bomber because of their ability to survive a first strike. Such distinctions became important as deterrence showed that it worked - and worked to the extent that neither side dared contemplate being first to use such awful destructive power. In spite of differences and international incidents far more serious than anything preceding the outbreak of either World War I or World War II, peace prevailed between the major alliances, even at the cost of many smaller and often bloody wars and of leaving the Soviet Union with its post-World War II subjugation of many European nations. The power of the atomic bomb was such that the United States sought to keep the new device to itself, not because of any desire for world domination but to maintain a counter to any future attempt at war. The discovery was not even shared with the British or the French Nevertheless, both these countries and the Soviet Union soon acquired the ability to produce nuclear weapons, with the latter obtaining the information through espionage. The first British atomic bomb was tested on 11 October 1956 at Maralinga in Australia, by which time
