d of up to 20,000 lbs required six General Electric J47-GE-25 turbojets, although these early jet engines were of just 6,000-lb thrust each. Minimal defensive armament was carried, this being confined to  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 160 161 DECLINE AND FALL a remote-control tail turret with 20-mm cannon. Several variants of the standard aircraft were built, including the RB-47B and RB-47E reconnais- sance bombers, and the RB-47H electronics reconnaissance aircraft. The British adopted a different and rather more elegant approach to the problem, with a clear connection between the first British jet bomber, the English Electric Canberra, and aircraft such as the Mosquito, inas- much as the aircraft was designed and entered service as a bomber, reconnaissance aircraft and night fighter. After a first flight in May 1949, deliveries of the first Canberra jet bombers to the Royal Air Force followed in January 1951. After the early versions, the Canberras, from the B(I)Mk.8 onwards, were delivered as interdictor bombers, designed to make high-accuracy precision bombing against specific targets, again an extension of the Mosquito legacy. Later versions powered by twin Rolls-Royce Avon turbojets of 7,400-lb thrust were capable of 540 mph and a range of 3,000 miles, or 800 miles with a full warload of 8,000 lbs, with 6,000 lbs carried internally and the remainder on under-wing strongpoints. The Canberra proved to be a highly successful aeroplane, technically and commercially, with production under licence in Australia and in the United States, where it was built by Martin as the B-57 for the USAF. Canberras also served with the air forces of New Zealand. India, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and Peru, and at the time of writing a few remain in service with the RAF as target tugs and reconnaissance aircraft. The number of significant bombers appearing during the 1950s and early 1960s was rather more than the decline of this type of aeroplane should necessarily have merited. The m
