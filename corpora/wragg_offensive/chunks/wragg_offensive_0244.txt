reconnaissance aircraft. The number of significant bombers appearing during the 1950s and early 1960s was rather more than the decline of this type of aeroplane should necessarily have merited. The most important of those from the United States was the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, which first flew in 1952 and which has ever since retained the distinction of being the world's largest bomber aircraft. An extremely ungainly aeroplane with excessive anhedral, eight 17,000-lb-thrust Pratt & Whitney TF33-P-3 turbojets pro- vide a typical B-52 with a maximum speed of 660 mph and a range of up to 12,500 miles, enabling the aircraft to carry a heavy conventional bombload, nuclear weapons or air-to-surface weapons, such as stand-off bombs or, in more recent years, their successor, the cruise missile. The early versions of this aircraft were withdrawn during the early 1960s, but most of the 750 built remained in service to see action in Vietnam while a number of later versions, mainly the B-52G and B-52H, have been refurbished to act as cruise-missile carriers. The British contemporary of the B-47 and B-52 in the strategic bombing role was the V-bomber, and for the last time in the history of British military aircraft procurement, the V-bomber force consisted of more than one aircraft type; indeed, there were four different designs, three of which entered production: the Vickers Valiant, Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor. The first of these aircraft was the Vickers Valiant, which first flew in May 1951 and which entered service in large numbers from 1955 on- wards. The intention was to create a 180-aircraft-strong V-bomber force, with the Valiant being displaced as the more advanced Vulcans and Victors entered service. Four 9,500-lb-thrust Rolls-Royce Avon turbojets gave the Valiant a maximum speed of 560 mph and a range of up to 3,400 miles. Although designed to carry nuclear weapons to reach key targets behind the Iron Curtain, and having the distinction of dropping both t
