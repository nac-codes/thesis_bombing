iant a maximum speed of 560 mph and a range of up to 3,400 miles. Although designed to carry nuclear weapons to reach key targets behind the Iron Curtain, and having the distinction of dropping both the first British atomic bomb and the first British hydrogen bomb, it was necessary to deploy Valiants in Malta and Cyprus as well as in the UK. After withdrawal from strategic bomber squadrons during the late 1950s, the Valiants were assigned to in-flight refuelling duties as tanker aircraft, with conversion of these being far less expensive than building new transport aircraft as tankers, although also far less satisfac- tory. It soon proved necessary to withdraw the Valiants from service as fatigue problems affected them in the early 1960s, leaving Victors to be converted to the tanker role. The Avro Vulcan was the world's first delta-wing jet bomber when it first flew in August 1952, again using Rolls-Royce Avon turbojets in the prototype, although in this case the production aircraft used the more powerful Bristol Siddeley Olympus turbojets when deliveries started to the RAF in mid-1956. The B.Mk.1 versions were followed in 1958 by the first flight of the B.Mk.2, with modified aerodynamic surfaces, which first entered service in mid-1960. The Vulcan could carry up to twenty- one 1,000-lb bombs, nuclear weapons or stand-off bombs and had a maximum speed of 640 mph and a range of 5,000 miles in the B.Mk.2 version. The third and last of this trio of large jet aircraft was the Handley Page Victor, with an unusual crescent-wing configuration. First flying in December 1952, the Victor used four Bristol Siddeley Sapphire turbojets in the B.Mk.1 version and four 20,600-lb-thrust Rolls-Royce Conway turbojets in the B.Mk.2, the latter first flying in February 1959. The B.Mk.2, could fly at 640 mph and had a range of 4,600 miles, while again being able to carry nuclear weapons, conventional bombs, with well in excess of a 20,000-lb warload internally and on under-wing strongpo
