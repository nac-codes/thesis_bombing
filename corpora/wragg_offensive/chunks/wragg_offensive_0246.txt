uld fly at 640 mph and had a range of 4,600 miles, while again being able to carry nuclear weapons, conventional bombs, with well in excess of a 20,000-lb warload internally and on under-wing strongpoints, or stand-off missiles. Several Vulcans and Victors were retained in the photographic reconnaissance role. The British designs represented a major divergence in design com- pared with their American counterparts, with the latter having their engines slung under the wings in pods, while the former had theirs concealed within the wings, even on aircraft such as the Victor B.Mk.2 with thinner wings to reduce drag and improve performance at high subsonic speeds, especially at low altitude. Of course, these aircraft were not the sole story, and others contributed to the development of the bomber. The United States Navy received  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 162 163 DECLINE AND FALL the North American A-5 Vigilante which, in spite of its 'A' (attack) designation, was in fact a bomber with the capability of carrying nuclear weapons from an aircraft-carrier and flying at twice the speed of sound. First flown in 1958, the A-5 had an unusual ventral tube bomb bay to reduce drag, but this so limited the aircraft to nuclear strike duties that most were later converted to the reconnaissance role. Another USN aircraft, the A-3D Skywarrior, had originally entered USAF service as the Douglas B-66 Destroyer, following a first flight in June 1954; a subsonic aircraft, the B-66 was a tactical counterpart to the B-47 and B-52 force and was eventually replaced by the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber. The Royal Navy also received a bomber or strike aircraft with nuclear capability, in the form of the Blackburn Buccaneer, with the aircraft first flying in April 1958 and the S.Mk. 1 version being followed by the S.Mk.2, first flown in May 1963. Powered by twin Rolls-Royce Spey turbojets of 11,255-lb thrust, the S.Mk.2 was trans-sonic in flight, and the twin-seat aircraft could carry a
