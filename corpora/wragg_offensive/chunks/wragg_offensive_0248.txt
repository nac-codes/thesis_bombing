950, the II-28 used twin 5,950-lb-thrust Klimov VK-1 turbojets developed from Rolls-Royce Nene turbojets sold to the USSR during the late 1940s. The aircraft lacked the performance of the best Western competition but could nevertheless carry a useful 4,500-lb warload over 1,500 miles at speeds of up to 580 mph. Comparable with the Canberra, the Il-28 was never a strategic bomber and was delivered to many of the Soviet Union's client states in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. Unlike the American designs, with their defensive tail turrets, the Il-28 also retained a nose turret, with twin 20-mm cannon in both. British jet bombers were not designed with turrets. There were four other Soviet bomber designs of note during the 1950s and early 1960s, the Myasishchev Mya-4 Bison, and the Tupolev Tu-16 Badger, Tu-95 Bear and Tu-22 Blinder. While many Soviet designs are clearly Western-inspired, these aircraft also portrayed a willingness to pursue ideas unique to Soviet designers, sometimes to the point of eccentricity. The Tupolev Tu-16 Badger was straightforward enough, with twin 20,950-lb-thrust Mikulin AM-3M turbojets providing a maximum speed of 590 mph and a range of up to 4,000 miles. In common with its Western counterparts, the Tu-16, which first appeared in 1954, could carry bombs, nuclear weapons or air-to-surface missiles. The Mya-4, the only design known to the West attributed to V. M. Myasishchev, was also conventional and could be considered as a smaller equivalent of the B-52. Also first flown in 1954, the Mya-4 used four 19,180-lb-thrust Mikulin AM-3D turbojets mounted in the wings for a maximum speed of 560 mph and a range of 7,000 miles, although the range with maximum warload, claimed to be 50,000 lbs by some sources, was undoubtedly far less. Less conventional than either of these were the Tu-95 and Tu-22. The Tu-95 Bear first appeared in 1955 and was the only strategic bomber to use turboprop engines, four 14,795-shp Kuznetsov NK-12M turboprops, which gave i
