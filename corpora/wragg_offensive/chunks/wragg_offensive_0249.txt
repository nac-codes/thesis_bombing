an either of these were the Tu-95 and Tu-22. The Tu-95 Bear first appeared in 1955 and was the only strategic bomber to use turboprop engines, four 14,795-shp Kuznetsov NK-12M turboprops, which gave it a maximum speed of almost 500 mph and a range of 7,800 miles, carrying up to 24,000 lbs of bombs or missiles. Few Tu-95s ever operated as bombers, and it is believed that most operated on electronic counter-measure and reconnaissance duties. The Tu-22 Blinder was also novel, one of the few supersonic turbojet bombers, replacing the Tu-16 and Tu-95. First appearing in 1961, the Tu-22 used twin 26,500-lb reheated-thrust turbojets for a maximum speed of 1,000 mph, or Mach 1.5, carrying air-to-surface missiles over ranges up to 3,000 miles. It was apparent soon after the war ended that a bomber overflying its target was a definite weakness. Even during World War II the Luftwaffe had experimented with glider bombs, the Henschel Hs.293, first using them against a flotilla of seven Royal Navy vessels on 25 April 1943, using Dornier Do.217s as launch aircraft in an unsuccessful attack. On 27 April another attack against a corvette resulted in some damage. The United States Navy had more success with the Bat, a rocket-powered and guided air-to-surface missile which was used against Japanese war- ships on a couple of occasions. Even as war ended, the growing use of radar and its increased efficiency, with the first appearance of airborne-  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 164 DECLINE AND FALL early-warning aircraft capable of extending radar range over the horizon, proof against even low-flying aircraft, showed that the risk of deploying manned bombers with conventional bombs was too great. The com- plexity of the air-to-surface missile also led to long development periods. Work started in 1946 on the Bell GAM-63 Rascal missile, which entered service with the USAF B-47s in 1957. Sometimes known as the 'stand-off' bomb, the Hawker Siddeley Dynamics Blue Steel entered service with the Royal
