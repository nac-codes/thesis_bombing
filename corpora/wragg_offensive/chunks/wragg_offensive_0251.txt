British nuclear deterrent passing from the Royal Air Force to the Royal Navy, just as in the United States the main responsibility passed from the USAF to the USN. Unlike the British, the Americans could still afford the cost of land-based missiles as well, however, and also had the space in which to deploy these well away from centres of population. This move marked the end of the truly independent British nuclear deterrent, for although Polaris had a British warhead and used British- built submarines, the missile itself was American. More important to our story, it also meant the end of the bomber as a strategic weapon. In spite of these developments, the post-war history of the bomber was not one of redundancy, nor of rapid obsolescence. The bomber had a 165 diminishing role, although not until the late-1960s and the entry into service of the SSBNs, the intermediate range ballistic missile-carrying submarines, did it completely lose its strategic role. For many years before this, there was a tendency for those air forces with large bombers to continue to act as if nothing had changed since the last days of World War II, and in spite of the absence of superpower conflict, opportunities to use bombers on operations did occur. The two wars in which the bomber was most prevalent were Korea and Vietnam. The Korean and Vietnam Wars are generally regarded as being dif- ferent, although in each case a Communist dictatorship attempted to overthrow a regime with Western support. In Korea the attack was by means of a conventional invasion, accompanied by strikes at airfields; in Vietnam guerrilla forces were infiltrated from the North, later aug- menting their strength by locally raised forces in areas which came under their control. These differences should not be overlooked, but they also conceal a major similarity between the two conflicts: in each case the invading power lacked heavy industry and sophisticated lines of com- munication against which a bomber campaign co
