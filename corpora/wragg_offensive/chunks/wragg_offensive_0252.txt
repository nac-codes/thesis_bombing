but they also conceal a major similarity between the two conflicts: in each case the invading power lacked heavy industry and sophisticated lines of com- munication against which a bomber campaign could inflict significant damage. In effect, both North Korea and North Vietnam were peasant societies, able to absorb heavy aerial attack without undue harm to the war effort or serious interruption to supplies for the forces at the front. The forces at the front in any case required fewer supplies than those of the opposing forces, living off the land and using relatively unsophisti- cated weapons. The use of the bomber was almost as wasteful as that of Luftwaffe bombers attacking the retreating British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk, with much effort expended for little damage against soft targets. When the North Koreans invaded the South on 25 June 1950, they were soon fighting not just the South Koreans and their American allies but most of the United Nations, after a Soviet boycott of the General Assembly enabled the UN to act decisively for one of the few occasions in its history. The first operations of the Korean Air Force were against airfields, with a USAF Military Air Transport Service Douglas C-54 transport being the first American casualty of the war. The Korean Air Force itself became an early casualty, with its 200 aircraft pitted against 1,200 American aircraft, based mainly in Japan and Okinawa and able to gain early aerial superiority over all Korea, with the support of USN and Royal Navy carrier-borne aircraft. The RAF was heavily engaged in operations elsewhere and could spare few aircraft for the Korean War. The early successes of the air war failed to compensate for setbacks on the ground, and the heavy air raids by Boeing B-29 Superfortresses from Okinawa did not prevent the UN forces nearly being driven back into the sea. (This was a situation to be repeated in Vietnam.) Perhaps the worst, and most fruitless of the Korean air operations came in mi
