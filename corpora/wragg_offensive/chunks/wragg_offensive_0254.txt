a surprise raid could not be mounted after the Armis- In spite of the bomber's contribution, the victory in Korea owed more to the brilliance of the strategy on the ground, and in particular to the landings behind North Korean lines to stabilize the front and stop the retreat by United Nations troops. While the war was being fought in Korea, the USAF's Strategic Air Command acquired hydrogen bombs in 1952 and organized its units into several states of preparedness and training, with the units assigned to carry nuclear weapons being given specific targets to attack ('take out') in the event of war. The capability of the SAC was increased as the Boeing B-47 Stratojet bombers entered service, with many B-29s and C-97 transports being converted to act as tanker aircraft, becoming KB-50s and KC-97s. The first specially designed jet tanker transports, the KC-135s, forerunners of the Boeing 707 and 720 family of jet airliners, entered SAC service in 1956. The USAF favoured the drogue system of in-flight refuelling to the RAF's hose-and-reel system, the former being faster, though allowing only one aircraft to refuel at a time, as against up to three at once in the RAF system. Modern McDonnell Douglas KC-10A Extender tanker transports can use both systems. The next major use of the heavy bomber in war also involved the United States in the Far East, with rising tension in Vietnam, part of the former French Indo-China, during the early 1960s. Little use had been 167 made of bomber aircraft by the French during their valiant and often brilliant campaign in Indo-China, which was marred by a shortage of equipment and the inexplicable tendency of the French, once an area had been secured, to build permanent strongpoints rather than move on and keep the enemy moving, thus providing him with fixed targets at which to retaliate. After French withdrawal, Vietnam was divided into two, a Communist North and a pro-Western South, along with ostensibly neutral Laos and Cambodia, althoug
