him with fixed targets at which to retaliate. After French withdrawal, Vietnam was divided into two, a Communist North and a pro-Western South, along with ostensibly neutral Laos and Cambodia, although both these countries tended to turn a blind eye to Communist incursions, which their armed forces were powerless to stop. While Communist guerrilla activity had been on the increase for some time, the Vietnam War effectively started in August 1964. North Vietnamese naval patrol craft attacked American vessels, and in retalia- tion more than sixty carrier-borne fighter-bombers of the USN attacked a North Vietnamese naval base. In February 1965 the USAF and USN started to bomb targets in North Vietnam, initially using almost 200 aircraft from the USAF and USN, with one of the Air Force's McDonnell Douglas F-4C Phantom fighter-bombers being the first American aircraft to be shot down by a North Vietnamese surface-to-air missile (SAM) on 24 July. Equipped with a wide variety of Soviet short- and long-range missiles, the North Vietnamese were more adept at using these than in deploying fighter aircraft, although as American counter-measures, such as decoy flares for heat-seeking missiles, intensified, it was found that the guided missiles were most effective when fired in large numbers, with unguided salvoes striking down many US aircraft. The war was one of the most varied in aviation history, with aircraft ranging from armed trainers to strategic bombers and supersonic fighter- bombers, while helicopters acted as troop-transports and gunships, and many transport aircraft were converted to spray defoliant on forests to reduce the concealment available to guerrilla forces. Tactics varied too, from attacks on lines of communications, cities and industrial targets, although these last-mentioned were few, and mining of harbours and ports, to closely co-ordinated saturation bombing of enemy troops as they closed in around American or South Vietnamese forces, in effect using th
