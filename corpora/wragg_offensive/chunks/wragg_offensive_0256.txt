e last-mentioned were few, and mining of harbours and ports, to closely co-ordinated saturation bombing of enemy troops as they closed in around American or South Vietnamese forces, in effect using the USAF as a form of flying artillery to break a superior force of North Vietnamese Army regulars. The war in Vietnam was at one and the same time an example of severe restraint by the United States and of overkill. The restraint lay in the constant and continuing reluctance to escalate the war, leaving first North Vietnamese cities and then ports, including Hanoi and Haiphong, free from bombing, even though the military situation in the South was crumbling. The overkill came in the use of massive quantities of bombs (especially of napalm, a jellified petroleum) against soft targets, including  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 168 169 DECLINE AND FALL villages suspected of harbouring North Vietnamese troops but which were often abandoned by the North Vietnamese, their guerrilla sup- porters and other able-bodied persons. The failure lay in the ability to fight a real jungle counter-insurgency campaign on the ground and in the inability to win the 'hearts and minds' of the people, both techniques having been used successfully by the British in Malaya during the early 1950s and then again in the newly independent state of Malaysia when facing confrontation by Indonesia during the early 1960s. An early indication of the intensity of the war came as early as 1965, with more than 12,000 sorties over North Vietnam and 60,000 over South Vietnam by the USAF and the South Vietnamese Air Force, dropping 81,000 tons of bombs, while another 6,000 sorties were conducted by USN and USMC aircraft. The giant Boeing B-52 Superfortresses started to bomb targets in Vietnam, flying 2,500 miles from Guam, while later other B-52s flew from bases in Thailand and Okinawa. These heavy raids were often ineffectual but could on other occasions disperse heavy concentrations of enemy troops, as at Khe Sanh in l
