hile later other B-52s flew from bases in Thailand and Okinawa. These heavy raids were often ineffectual but could on other occasions disperse heavy concentrations of enemy troops, as at Khe Sanh in late 1967, when this base was besieged and in danger of being overrun, but a major North Vietnamese ground attack was fended off from the air. Yet raids against the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the main supply route from North Vietnam into the South, were of only limited value, since the mules and porters used by the North Vietnamese could readjust their route following a heavy attack, unlike road vehicles, canal barges or railway freight trains. While many wanted North Vietnam 'bombed back into the Stone Age', the early bombing raids had limited effect, although as the war dragged on and attempts were made to negotiate an end to the conflict, the North Vietnamese always wanted a cessation to the bombing as a pre-condition, suggesting that it was taking some toll of their war effort. One cessation of raids against North Vietnam came early in 1966, but this had little effect on the North or on the military situation in the South, so raids started again. An early success in 1966 was the destruction of Hanoi's power station by USN Grumman A-6 Intruders. The delivery of radar-assisted heavy anti-aircraft artillery and SAM-7 anti-aircraft missiles to the North had a severe effect on the cost of the American air raids, and increasingly stand-off or 'smart' bombs, in effect laser-guided air-to-surface missiles, began to show greater success. In the case of the Thanh Hoa Bridge near Hanoi, more than 800 conventional bombing sorties had failed to touch the bridge, but four laser-equipped USAF Phantom fighter-bombers destroyed this target at the first attempt. Other bridges followed, and the raid by the A-6s on the Lang Chi power station also used five 'smart' bombs. After another attempt at negotiations and another ceasefire in late 1972, the raids were resumed, this time with the General
