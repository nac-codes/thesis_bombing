id by the A-6s on the Lang Chi power station also used five 'smart' bombs. After another attempt at negotiations and another ceasefire in late 1972, the raids were resumed, this time with the General Dynamics F-111 variable-geometry supersonic bomber augment- ing the B-52 effort in eleven days of intensive round-the-clock bombing of North Vietnam, destroying all centres of communication, oil tanks, power stations, electricity supply lines and ammunition dumps, and facing more than 1,200 SAM-7 guided missiles. It was not until early in 1972 that the first attacks on Haiphong, the port for Hanoi, were sanctioned, with the port being sealed off within a short time by magnetic and acoustic mines, which were extremely diffi- cult and dangerous to sweep. More than six million tons of high-explosive bombs were dropped during the Vietnam War, several times the amount used against Germany during World War II. To some extent it seemed to work, with a ceasefire being agreed in early 1973, under which the Americans and the Russians agreed to refuse to replenish the stocks of armaments held by the two opposing sides. Unfortunately, while the United States stood by the agreement, rapidly reducing the American presence in Vietnam, the Soviets continued to maintain supplies to the North Vietnamese. De- feat followed defeat for the South, and by April 1975 it was all but over, leaving the United States Navy to evacuate their own nation- als and many South Vietnamese as the month, and the war, drew to a close. Many more Vietnamese voted with their feet, braving the weather and pirates to flee to the West in small boats during the years that followed. Had the United States cut off the supply of military material to the North Vietnamese by mining the harbours earlier in the war, as well as keeping the infrastructure under steady and accurate aerial bombard- ment, it could have been impossible for the North Vietnamese to have gathered the strength necessary to bring the war to a success
