keeping the infrastructure under steady and accurate aerial bombard- ment, it could have been impossible for the North Vietnamese to have gathered the strength necessary to bring the war to a successful con- clusion. Good jungle warfare skills, using professional rather than con- script troops, and a serious attempt to win the hearts and minds of the South Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian peasants, could have made victory possible. Even so, it would have been a long war, possibly with total victory proving elusive. The carpet bombing of large areas of jungle and paddyfield by B-52s was not the best way forward; accurate destruction of strategic targets by fighter-bombers equipped with the so-called 'smart' weapons was far more successful and useful. The political and military background to the events at Suez in 1956 is complex, but in essence an Anglo-French invasion of the Canal Zone became likely after Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, an international waterway, in July that year. Subsequently Egypt refused to abide by the principle of free and uninterrupted passage of vessels through the canal, regardless of nationality. Britain and France prepared to intervene, and at first international opinion was strongly in favour of their doing so. Unfortunately the inability of these two nations to mount the operation quickly led to the waning of support, except from Israel, which had an  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 170 DECLINE AND FALL immediate interest in the outcome, since Israeli vessels were barred from using the canal. Continuing friction between Israel and Egypt led to the outbreak of war between these two countries in October 1956, as the British and French naval task force prepared for an invasion of Egypt, with air and land forces assembled at British bases in Cyprus. As the conflict threatened the security of the canal, Britain and France demanded that Egyptian and Israeli forces withdraw to lines ten miles on either side of the Canal Zone. Israel complied, Egypt r
