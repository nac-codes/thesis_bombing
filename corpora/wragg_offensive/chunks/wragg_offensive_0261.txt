tries being supported by the Soviet Union while the United States supported Israel. In effect. the situation almost amounted to a state of war by proxy, with neither of the major alliances able to contemplate a direct conflict. The small state of Israel lacked the depth in which to fight a major war and was not only numerically inferior to the Arab states but as time progressed was in danger of being outgunned as well, as the level of equipment in the Arab armed forces and the standard of training and combat-readiness of the Arabs also improved. The Israeli Defence Force/Air Force had also developed during this time, with some 350 aircraft, mainly French-built Dassault Mystère and Ouragan fighter-bombers, as well as a number of 171 Super Mystère interceptors and the then new Mirage III fighters. Part of the Air Force and most of the Army depended on the mobilization of reservists to match the Arab forces, but this also took time, which Israel did not possess for the entire country might be quickly overrun in a lightning strike. Nor could reservists be mobilized for long, if the Israeli economy was not to collapse. Rising tension in the Middle East during May 1967 convinced the Israeli Government that an Arab attack was likely, with Arab armies gathering close to the borders of Israel, and Egypt demanding the withdrawal of the United Nations Emergency Force in Sinai, after which Egyptian troops advanced into the largely desert area. In desperation, the Israeli Government ordered a surprise attack on the Arab states starting on 5 June, initially attacking Egypt and Jordan and then, in spite of a United Nations ceasefire resolution being passed in the General Assembly on 7 June, attacking Syria on 9 June. The key to success had to be a pre-emptive strike by the Israeli Defence Force/Air Force's 350 aircraft against the Arab airfields, gaining aerial superiority before supporting troops on the ground. Israel's small but well-educated and skilled population favoured the
