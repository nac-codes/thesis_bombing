uring the following days, the IDF/AF operated against Arab tanks and supply lines, but its efforts were not essential to victory on the  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 172 DECLINE AND FALL ground; the Israeli Army's Centurion tanks outgunned the Arab Russian-built T-54 tanks, and in the desert the war became a battle between highly mobile armoured formations, with infantry either left behind or used as mobile armoured or paratroop units. The end of the war left Israel with a vastly enlarged territory, providing a natural defensive position in the Golan Heights overlooking Syria, while the seizure of Sinai provided a buffer zone which could absorb any Egyptian attack. Jordan lost the west bank of the River Jordan, giving Israel yet another natural defensive position. A more secure strategic position for Israel did not mean stability, with the Arab nations anxious to make good their territorial losses and no less anxious to avenge their defeat. The Arabs themselves planned a major strike against Israel, choosing the Hebrew festival of Yom Kippur to mount an attack. Disagreement between the Egyptians, who favoured a late-afternoon attack, and the Syrians, who wanted a dawn attack, in each case to ensure that the sun was behind the advancing armies, led to a compromise, an attack at 14.00, on 6 October 1973. The Egyptian air strikes on the first day failed to neutralize the Israeli Air Force, but in the subsequent fighting the IDF/AF found that it was facing a far better equipped, trained and motivated opponent than in the past. Aerial warfare between fighters and backed by attacks by fighter-bombers and ground-attack aircraft in 1970 had already shown the Israelis the threat posed by a complex anti-aircraft defence. This was based on SAM SA-2, -3, -6, -7 and -9 missiles, supplied by the Soviet Union, which provided the defence in depth which had earlier been lacking and yet which is so essential to prevent defeat. Instead of losing no more than thirty aircraft as in 1967, the Is
