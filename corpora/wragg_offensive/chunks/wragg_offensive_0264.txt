the Soviet Union, which provided the defence in depth which had earlier been lacking and yet which is so essential to prevent defeat. Instead of losing no more than thirty aircraft as in 1967, the Israelis lost almost 200. The Israeli Army rebuffed the early Arab advances on the ground, while the Arabs over-stretched their lines of supply by advancing too far too quickly. The firing of guided missiles in salvoes also depleted the stocks available, so that there was a growing number of occasions during which IDF/AF aircraft could attack with impunity. A ceasefire on 22 October was ignored by the increasingly victorious Israelis, who eventually suc- cumbed to American pressure to observe the ceasefire on 24 October Peace came to the Middle East in a patchy way, with a change of leadership in Egypt followed by a peace agreement between that country and Israel during the early 1980s. Friction elsewhere remained, not least due to the activities of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and other similar groups, often using refugee camps as bases. Israeli Air and Special Forces strikes against these bases were e e eventually followed by an invasion of Lebanon, although again this tended to be primarily an Army operation. After Israeli forces withdrew from Lebanon in 1985, terrorist attacks continued. Iraqi work on a nuclear reactor, said to be for peaceful 173 purposes but which could have led to the availability of materials with which to produce a crude atomic bomb, resulted in an IDF/AF raid on the reactor in 1981. Late in 1985 continued terrorist attacks led the IDF/ AF to send its new General Dynamics F-16 fighter-bombers to attack the PLO's headquarters in Tunis, flying over 1,450 miles from their bases in Israel with the aid of in-flight refuelling from Boeing KC-97 Stratotankers. Ironically, the PLO had moved to Tunis in 1982 to be outside the range of IDF/AF attack, although the Israelis had acquired elderly, but still effective, tanker aircraft well before thi
