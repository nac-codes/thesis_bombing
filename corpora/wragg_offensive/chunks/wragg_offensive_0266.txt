ir Force bases close to the border with West Pakistan, achieved little. Too few Indian Air Force bases were attacked, and in insufficient strength, with most of the PAF being held back from the conflict for reasons which have never been satisfactorily explained. Fewer than 100 out of the 300 combat aircraft available to the PAF were deployed, and the attack at 18.00, late on the Moslem Sabbath, did not catch the IAF offguard. The following day found the IAF in a position to retaliate, while PAF operations were hampered by the availability to the IAF of Tupolev Tu-126 'Moss' airborne early-warning aircraft, along with extensive electronic counter-measures.
