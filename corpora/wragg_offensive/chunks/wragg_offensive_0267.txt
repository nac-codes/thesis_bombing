regain the Falkland Islands from Argentina in the late spring of 1982, with both the British and Argentinian forces mounting aerial attacks. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands on Friday 2 April 1982. Bomber aircraft were not used in the invasion, which was initially from the sea, with a determined resistance to the invading forces by Royal Marines detachments both on the Falklands at Port Stanley and on South Georgia, the following day. To retake the islands, a naval task force was as- sembled quickly by the British, centred on the two aircraft-carriers, HMS Hermes and Invincible, while additional aircraft were also carried aboard the converted containership Atlantic Conveyor. The combat element of the aircraft used in the Falklands campaign consisted mainly of British Aerospace Sea Harrier vertical take-off fighter aircraft, but the shortage of these in a Fleet Air Arm much reduced in size required a number of RAF Harriers to be included with the task force. The limited range of the Harriers and Sea Harriers, and the fact that the Falkland Islands were well beyond the range of the RAF's bomber force, meant that hostilities aimed at retaking the islands could not commence until the task force closed on the islands. There were other considerations. As the task force sailed south, having been assembled far more quickly from a Royal Navy far smaller than had been available at the time of Suez, negotiations were in hand in an attempt to resolve the crisis created by Argentina's invasion. The islands had a long and continuous history of British colonization while the Argentinians claimed that their colonial claim was of longer standing, although at no time had the islands been settled by Argentinians. At the time of the crisis, Royal Air Force bombers consisted primarily of the British Aerospace Buccaneer, a development of the S.1 and S.2 aircraft originally developed for the Royal Navy, which had a combat radius of 1,000 miles, even though this aeroplane could fly
