y of the British Aerospace Buccaneer, a development of the S.1 and S.2 aircraft originally developed for the Royal Navy, which had a combat radius of 1,000 miles, even though this aeroplane could fly at trans-sonic speeds and carry up to sixteen 1,000-lb bombs, four of them internally and the remainder on four under-wing strongpoints. The nearest avail- able base for a bomber strike was at Ascension Island, 3,800 miles from the Falklands. The Buccaneers were being gradually replaced by the Panavia Tornado at the time, with the latter aircraft also replacing the RAF's remaining 'V' bomber force Avro Vulcans. Only the Vulcans offered the prospect of a raid on the Falklands, yet most of the aircraft had been withdrawn from service, leaving just a handful for reconnaissance duties, while the RAF had a shortage of operational aircrew as ex- perienced pilots passed through the lengthy Tornado conversion pro- gramme. A single Vulcan was taken off reconnaissance duties and despatched to Ascension Island to make a solitary bombing raid on the main airfield on the Falkland Islands at Port Stanley, several miles outside the town and thus without any risk to the civilian inhabitants. Before 08.00 on Saturday 1 May, the Vulcan bombed the airfield, dropping twenty-one 1,000-lb bombs intended to crater the runway, although in fact these exploded on either side of it. The Vulcan raid was followed up within minutes by successive waves of Sea Harriers, each carrying three 1,000-lb bombs, with the main force attacking the airfield at Port Stanley, while a small force also attacked an improvised air strip at Goose Green. Many Argentinian aircraft were destroyed on the ground, while others were shot down in air-to-air combat by the Harriers and Sea Harriers. How- ever, operational flying was limited for a time after the first raid by poor weather, while intensive Argentinian raids against the task force, especially after it landed the invading British troops at San Carlos Water, also me
