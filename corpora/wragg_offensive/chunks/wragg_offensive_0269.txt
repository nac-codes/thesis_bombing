s limited for a time after the first raid by poor weather, while intensive Argentinian raids against the task force, especially after it landed the invading British troops at San Carlos Water, also meant that the RAF and Fleet Air Arm aircraft found their role primarily that of air defence, rather than ground attack. Although the Argentine Navy's sole aircraft-carrier, the Veinticino de Majo, was confined to port during the campaign, some believe with boiler trouble, others that it was decided to protect the ship after the loss to a British submarine of the cruiser General Belgrano, the Argentinian Navy's Fleet Air Arm was operational. The Argentinians had just received the first deliveries of Dassault Super Etendard attack aircraft, equipped to launch Exocet air-to-surface guided missiles. Usually such attacks would be launched with three aircraft, one flying ahead to 'illuminate' the target with its radar, while another two, each carrying a single Exocet, would launch the strike. On 4 May a Super Etendard launched a successful attack against the British Type 42 guided missile destroyer, HMS Sheffield. Although the sea-skimming missile struck the warship six feet above the waterline, it failed to explode, but its burning fuel and the impact of the missile knocked out the warship's control systems and started fires which rendered the ship incapable of fighting within two minutes. After five hours of fighting the blaze, with assistance from other Royal Navy  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 176 177 DECLINE AND FALL ships, the decision was taken to abandon the Sheffield, largely because she was no longer able to fight and was also a distraction to the other ships of the task force, which were vulnerable as ships stood by HMS Sheffield. The crippled destroyer did not sink immediately, however, and it was decided to tow her back to Britain for possible repair and examination, but once under tow she eventually sank in a heavy gale.
