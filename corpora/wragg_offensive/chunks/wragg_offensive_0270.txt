however, and it was decided to tow her back to Britain for possible repair and examination, but once under tow she eventually sank in a heavy gale. Further attacks by the Fleet Air Arm on the Falklands before the landings at San Carlos on 21 May were soon followed by the Argentine Air Force mounting an intensive series of attacks, mainly using McDon- nell Douglas A-4 Skyhawk fighter-bombers. The raids were pressed ahead with considerable courage, and in spite of the poor showing by the Argentine Navy and Army throughout the campaign, few had anything other than admiration for the Air Force. Three Skyhawks were shot down on 14 May, another nine on 21 May and seven on 24 May.

Worse followed. On Tuesday 8 June two landing ships, the RFA Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram, were attacked by Argentine aircraft as they discharged men and supplies at Bluff Cove, with the loss of fifty members of the Welsh Guards and RFA crew members. The Sir Galahad sank, but Sir Tristram was later towed back to the UK for repairs.

On recapturing the airfield at Port Stanley, the advancing British troops discovered that the Argentinians had been preparing to use napalm (jellified petroleum) against the advancing British forces, dropping this anti-personnel weapon from Pucara counter-insurgency aircraft. The campaign in the Falklands proved conclusively that the displace- m
