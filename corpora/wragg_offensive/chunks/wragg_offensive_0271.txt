ied petroleum) against the advancing British forces, dropping this anti-personnel weapon from Pucara counter-insurgency aircraft. The campaign in the Falklands proved conclusively that the displace- ment of the strategic bomber by fighter-bombers, strike aircraft and ground-attack types on the one hand, and by guided weapons on the other, had been completed. Area bombing no longer had a place in the nuclear age, when just one warhead could achieve a more substantial result. The need to locate specific targets and destroy them called for smaller and faster aircraft using 'smart' weapons which could be guided onto the target by radar or lasers. Even helicopters equipped with air-to-surface missiles for anti-tank or anti-shipping use could create more damage than many a World War II bombing raid, as the Royal Navy showed during the retaking of South Georgia, when a Sea Skua missile from a helicopter sank the Argentinian submarine Santa Fe. Earlier, two Argentinian patrol craft had been attacked by two Westland Sea Lynx helicopters armed with Sea Skua missiles, sinking one and damaging the other. It took more than one campaign for the bomber to establish itself, and its demise if it comes will be decided by more than one action. It is a question not so much of the capabilities of the bomber as of the growing capability of aircraft which would have been regarded as fighter-bombers or ground-attack aircraft, or at best light bombers, during World War II. In their operations against Libya, the United States Air Force could have used its force of B-52s but the US deployed carrier-borne Grumman A-6 Intruders and Ling-Temco-Vought A-7 Corsair IIs of the United States Navy, and these were joined after the initial operations by the USAF's UK-based General Dynamics F-111B fighter-bombers. Libya had for some years posed a threat to many of its neighbours, especially Egypt, the Sudan and Chad, as well as perpetrating a series of terrorist attacks aimed initially at the political o
