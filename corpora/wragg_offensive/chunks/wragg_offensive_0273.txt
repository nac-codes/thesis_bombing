surface-to-air missiles were fired at the Tomcats, without success. At 20.25 A-7 Corsair IIs from the uss Saratoga and America attacked and sank a Libyan missile- carrying patrol boat, and forty minutes later other aircraft attacked and destroyed the SAM-5 missile base and its radar installation. Other attacks that night and during the following day accounted for four more Libyan  179 DECLINE AND FALL THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON naval vessels, and there were two further attacks on the guided missile 178 Further escalation of Libyan violence followed, with one American serviceman killed and many more injured in a terrorist bomb attack on a Berlin nightclub, while civilians, including children, were killed when a bomb exploded on a TWA Boeing 727 as it approached Athens; the aircraft was on final approach, and an explosive decompression did not occur at this reduced altitude, so that the aircraft managed to land safely. In retaliation, at 01.00 on 15 April, aircraft from the Sixth Fleet carriers uss America and Coral Sea, with some thirty A-6s and A-7s, raided Benghazi and the military airfield near the town, while at least twenty- one F-111Bs attacked Tripoli and a naval base. The official figures given here have been queried by some sources, which suggest that as many as forty-four F-111Bs may have been used in the raid. The F-111Bs operated from two bases in the UK, at Upper Heyford and Lakenheath, and were refuelled on their outward and return flights by a force of twenty McDonnell Douglas KC-10A Extender and Boeing KC-135 tankers, which had flown into their forward bases at Mildenhall and Fairford during the two days before the mission was launched. Electronic counter-measures were provided by Grumman EA-6B Prowlers which accompanied the Sixth Fleet aircraft, and EF-111Bs with the USAF forma- tion. One F-111B flew into the sea during the low-altitude run-in to Tripoli. The aircraft used anti-radar Shrike and Warm missiles to destroy Libyan radar, as well as laser-guide
