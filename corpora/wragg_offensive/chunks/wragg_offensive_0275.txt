in preventing escalation of such a conflict and concentrating instead on effective counter-measures and avoiding leniency in punishment. In spite of the problems created by Libya for her Arab neighbours, the reaction of the other Arab nations was to support Libya and denounce the role of the USA and the UK. The only logical result which could reasonably have been expected from a bombing attack would be all-out warfare, but this would have been politically unacceptable given the Libyan practice of attempting to play the Atlantic Alliance and the Warsaw Pact countries off against one another. MAK  9 181 THE BOMBER TODAY The Bomber Today The history of the bomber has been marked by a search for two attributes: the ability to strike effectively and accurately at a specific target, such as a bridge, a power station or a ship, and the capability of inflicting wholly unacceptable damage on a large area. In many ways, the failure of the bomber to achieve the first broke the patience of the politicians and military leaders and led inevitably to the abandoning of good intentions and the adoption of the second course. In devising the means of achieving both these ends, there has been created the paradox that the bomber is missing from all but a few of the world's largest air forces. If an entire city needs to be wiped out, this can be achieved through using missiles, and those with a nuclear war- head can inflict damage far in excess of anything at Hiroshima or Nagasaki, or any of the German and Japanese cities which suffered intensive conventional bombing. The pinpoint accuracy of interdiction bombing requires the delivery of a small warhead accurately, with modern conventional explosives far more effective than their World War II counterparts in terms of damage-for-weight, while air-to-surface missiles or 'smart bombs' can be carried by a fighter-bomber, fighter, ground-attack aircraft or even helicopters. The use of such weapons and the end of massive bombing raids has mea
