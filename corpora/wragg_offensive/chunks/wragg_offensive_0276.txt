e air-to-surface missiles or 'smart bombs' can be carried by a fighter-bomber, fighter, ground-attack aircraft or even helicopters. The use of such weapons and the end of massive bombing raids has meant that instead of the bomber the modern air force has 'strike' aircraft, suggesting something more precise and specific, delivered far more quickly than anything which could be achieved by the bomber. Except for aircraft carrying cruise missiles or the larger 'stand-off' bombs and missiles, most of these operations are today conducted over comparatively short ranges, although it might be going too far to suggest that the modern air force has moved away from the principles of Mitchell and Douhet and back to those of Liddell Hart. The bomber as we know it belongs to just three air forces today, those of the United States, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. It is hard to accept that aircraft such as the Panavia Tornado GR.1. in service with the RAF, the Aeronautica Militare Italiano, the Luftwaffe and the Marineflieger, which replaced bombers in the RAF, can really be a bomber. It is even difficult to give this designation to the Arm√©e de l'Air's force of Dassault Mirage IVs in the Force de Frappe, although this aircraft deserves the designation to some extent at least, especially with the introduction of air-launched ASMP nuclear missiles to these aircraft in May 1986. For most air forces, it is as if the ideal aeroplane is not the Spitfire, Mustang, Zero or Bf.109, nor the Lancaster, Flying Fortress or Do.177, but the Mosquito or Lightning. There are fewer fighters today with a genuine dogfight capability, although there are missiles supposedly able to undertake this role, and fewer heavy bombers, but a lot of aeroplanes with the attributes of a light bomber, long-range fighter or night fighter. This is a generalization, of course, and the real truth is that the modern fighter-bomber has become an extremely potent weapon system, while the idea of carry
