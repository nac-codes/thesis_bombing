er, long-range fighter or night fighter. This is a generalization, of course, and the real truth is that the modern fighter-bomber has become an extremely potent weapon system, while the idea of carrying weapons internally has largely been replaced by carrying small aerodynamically shaped missiles and bombs externally. The warload of a modern fighter- bomber is well in excess of that of many World War II medium bombers. 'Smart bombs' are just that, using radar or laser guidance onto the target, sometimes with another aircraft accompanying the missile- carrying aircraft to highlight the target with a radar or laser beam, virtually taking over the target-marking role of the pathfinders. Weapons themselves have become more varied. Instead of cratering a runway, a runway-denial weapon is used instead. The terminology is not pure gibberish. Such runway-denial weapons as the Hunting JP.233 de- veloped for the RAF's Tornado strike aircraft, are not simply bombs, though they will crater the runways as a first step; they also include anti-vehicle and anti-personnel mines and other delayed-action weapons to make clearance of the runway difficult. The idea is to deny use of the runway for twenty-four hours. The increasing effectiveness of radar has made bomber operations more difficult, with the advent of airborne-early-warning radar providing some defence against low-flying aircraft and cruise missiles. Every ad- vance in defensive measures calls for an advance in the technology used by the attacking forces, however, and in the case of radar this has taken the form of missiles which home onto the radiation emissions from radar installations. Typical of these missiles is the AGM-88 high-speed anti-radar missile, HARM, and the British Aerospace air-launched anti- radar missile, ALARM. Such weapons fit easily on under-wing strong- points of aircraft such as the Tornado and can be part of a composite warload with bombs or other missiles. The variety of delivery systems available
