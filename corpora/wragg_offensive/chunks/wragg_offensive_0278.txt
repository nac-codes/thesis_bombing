RM. Such weapons fit easily on under-wing strong- points of aircraft such as the Tornado and can be part of a composite warload with bombs or other missiles. The variety of delivery systems available today and their cost have created problems for politicians, who have to decide on one, or at the most two, systems, and struggle to afford even these. A wrong guess can leave a country with the core of its defences cut out, and it is not simply a question of guessing at the immediate future, but one of deciding early enough in the ten-year development life of a major weapons system to concentrate on that weapon and then be assured of  THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 182 on THE BOMBER TODAY its continued potency during a fifteen to twenty-five year operational life. Updating of a system during this time has to be expected; the hope is that complete redundancy will not occur. It is generally accepted that aircraft, for example, will receive a number of performance improve- ments which can be retrofitted during their operational life, with the most important of these being enhanced counter-measure techniques. The British nuclear deterrent, based since the early 1970s on the Polaris intermediate-range ballistic missile launched from four nuclear-powered submarines, was updated during the early 1980s under the Chevaline programme, with the most significant development being in the addition of decoys to the warhead's three independently targeted re-entry vehicles, each of which carries a nuclear weapon. There is sufficient doubt over the long-term prospects for every kind of strategic weapons system for those countries which can afford to do so retaining as many different options as possible. The manned bomber is prone to anti-aircraft fire, by both artillery and guided missiles, jam- ming of its navigational equipment and interception by fighter aircraft; it is most easily detected at altitude, but even when flying low, airborne- early-warning radar aircraft can pick up the intruder an
