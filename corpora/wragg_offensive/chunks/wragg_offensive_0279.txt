of its navigational equipment and interception by fighter aircraft; it is most easily detected at altitude, but even when flying low, airborne- early-warning radar aircraft can pick up the intruder and either transmit their radar signal to a ground control station or directly control fighter aircraft themselves. 'Stand-off' weapons, which can now include cruise missiles, present a more difficult target but can still be detected. Since most are subsonic, defensive measures, including anti-missile artillery and missiles, such as the shipborne Sea Wolf, can react. The size of warhead that such missiles carry is usually so small that accuracy is vital, even with nuclear warheads, and to help this corrective guidance from navigational satellites is crucial, but these are vulnerable to killer satel- lites, and even before the American Strategic Defence Initiative was first mooted, the so-called 'Star Wars' programme, the Soviet Union had been experimenting with such weapons. Ballistic missiles will be the target of the SDI, and since both sides generally appear to keep within a reasonable distance of each other when making technological progress, there is a real risk of these weapons being much reduced in effectiveness, with all the uncertainty for deterrence that this implies. It is for these reasons that the nations with a nuclear warfare capability have so many warheads available. There may be too many warheads, but there will always have to be a surplus over the number required to provide an effective deterrent if it is to work. The almost overnight obsolescence of a weapons system, the inability to use certain missiles, the wrong place, because they are destroyed in a pre-emptive strike, in the targeted unsuitably or undergoing maintenance, means that the absolute minimum implies too great a risk of being overrun by a first strike. The large number of warheads and delivery systems makes a first strike unlikely simply because of the retention of the so-called 'second
