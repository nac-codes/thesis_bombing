m implies too great a risk of being overrun by a first strike. The large number of warheads and delivery systems makes a first strike unlikely simply because of the retention of the so-called 'second strike' 183 retaliatory capability retained by the USA, USSR, UK and France. If the bomber has effectively, and officially, disappeared from many air forces, it did not go without a struggle, and the history of the aircraft and of its strike aircraft successors has not been without controversy. Although the United States Air Force has suffered many changes of heart over the new North American Rockwell B-1 bomber, this has been nothing compared with the fiasco on the other side of the Atlantic when it came to replacing the Royal Air Force's Canberras and the remaining 'V' bomber force Victors and Vulcans, at the time already contemplating a downgrading of their role following the decision to purchase the Polaris submarine-launched missile. During the early 1960s the RAF saw Bomber, Fighter and Coastal Commands amalgamated into Strike Command. At the time, the service was expecting 150 British Aircraft Corporation TSR-2 aircraft, a nuclear- capable supersonic bomber, reconnaissance and strike aircraft capable of flying at Mach 2.0 and of operating from unprepared runways as well as possessing the capability to fly below defending enemy radar defences, the so-called Hi-Lo-Lo-Hi operational pattern. In 1965 the aircraft was cancelled, with no fewer than thirty examples at various stages of completion on the production line. Instead, the British Government ordered a version of the General Dynamics F-111 known as the F-111K, citing as one excuse for this action that the Royal Australian Air Force had already decided in favour of this aircraft instead of the TSR-2, although the RAAF order was for just twenty aircraft and of little real significance. The rising cost of the F-111 and the early technical problems of this sophisticated variable-geometry Mach 2.0 bomber eventually
