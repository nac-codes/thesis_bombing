to USAF interest in the aircraft on the grounds that it would be used in the Vietnam War. Ironically the Buccaneer would have been useless on counter-insurgency duties, yet the SAAF was allowed to buy Italian-design Aermacchi MB.326K Impala aircraft with British engines, which could be used for such a role, although there is no evidence of these aircraft being used in this way. In Vietnam the Buccaneer equipped with 'smart bombs' would have been more effective than the use of B-52s on area bombing. Only slightly less controversial than the problems over the strike aircraft for the RAF has been the stop-start history of the B-1. The aircraft was shelved once, and then restarted. Cost and the claim that the aircraft would be either obsolescent in the missile age or mark an escalation in the arms race between NATO and the Warsaw Pact were among the arguments behind the suspension of this aircraft's development. There have also been some technical problems, possibly inevitable when de- veloping such a large and complex aircraft. The suggestion that the USSR would view the aircraft as an escalation of the arms race does not hold much substance since the Soviet Long-Range Aviation Forces have aircraft of equal or superior performance. There is also a real need for an aircraft which is faster than the B-52 to act as a cruise-missile carrier. So what is the position of the bomber in the modern air force? The Soviet Union maintains a substantial bomber force in its Long- Range Aviation Forces, which are currently receiving the first production models of the new Tupolev bomber known to NATO as Blackjack A. Blackjack A is believed to be equipped with the AS-15 air-launched cruise missile, although the actual design-bureau designation of the aircraft itself is still not known in the West. A variable-geometry aircraft, Black- jack is believed to use four reheated turbofans for a maximum speed of Mach 2.1 and to have a combat radius of some 4,500 miles. Blackjack will replace th
