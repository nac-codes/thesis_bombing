ate airborne-early-warning, airborne command and control and electronic counter-measure aircraft, as well as many aircraft in the reconnaissance and electronic intelligence roles, some of which are modified bomber types while others are variations of civil airliners or military transports. Tanker aircraft are available to both air forces, with full mobilization of the USAF Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units bringing the total number of Boeing KC-135 tanker aircraft available to more than 600. Although the United States places greater reliance on submarine-launched ballistic missiles than does the Soviet Union, the USAF has within Strategic Air Command responsibility for the remaining land-based ballistic missiles. The older Titan ICBMs have been retired and the original Minuteman missiles largely replaced by one hundred MEM-118 Peacekeeper missiles, but many more up-to-date Minuteman II and III missiles are also maintained by the eight ICBM wings of the USAF SAC. By 1988 the initial order of one hundred Rockwell International B-1B bombers will have displaced many of the B-52Hs assigned to the deep penetration role within SAC. The variable-geometry B-1B uses four reheated General Electric F101 turbofans for a maximum speed in excess of Mach 1.2 and maximum range of more than 6,000 miles, although the actual combat radius has not been released. It will have one of the heaviest warloads of any contemporary aircraft, of some 66,000 lbs, although to what extent such a large warload is necessary today may be questionable. The design problems encountered with this aircraft, especially with the original plan for a variable-geometry intake for the engines, have meant that the performance in terms of maximum speed is well below that of the latest Soviet bombers or of the Concorde supersonic airliner. Bombers do have one fundamental advantage, they can be recalled. In a sense, this arises from one weakness, the longer time taken for a bomber to reach its target com
