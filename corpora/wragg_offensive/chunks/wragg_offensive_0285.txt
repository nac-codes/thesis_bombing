the Concorde supersonic airliner. Bombers do have one fundamental advantage, they can be recalled. In a sense, this arises from one weakness, the longer time taken for a bomber to reach its target compared to an ICBM, but it is an added degree of security which many regard as reducing the risk of war  186 THE OFFENSIVE WEAPON 187 THE BOMBER TODAY escalating by mistake or miscalculation. So convinced is the United States of the value of the bomber that a major and costly programme of research is well advanced on a bomber which will be able to escape detection by radar. This is the aptly-named 'stealth' aircraft. The aircraft will not rely on a low-altitude approach or electronics countermeasures to avoid detection, instead it will use materials and a design which will reduce its radar image. Although little has been revealed about the programme, it is generally believed that the aircraft will be a 'flying-wing', with few corners and no flat surfaces to reflect radar signals. All surfaces will be curved, and the engines may be placed below the wing surface and hidden in the wing so that turbine blades cannot be picked up by radar, and even the cockpit is likely to be set well back - some believe that the pilot may use television to fly the aircraft during take-off and landing. The only other country to be able to base its nuclear deterrent on a 'triad' of land, sea and air-launched missiles is France, although French equipment lacks the range of Soviet or American missiles, partly because of cost and partly because French policy is to be able to 'tear off a leg' rather than seek total obliteration of the enemy, which is the objective of the two superpowers and of the United Kingdom. In addition to the submarine-launched and land-based missiles, the French Arm√©e de l'Air maintains the airborne element of this 'triad' of weapons, such that one suspects that the French objective has also been to avoid in-fighting between the three armed services.
