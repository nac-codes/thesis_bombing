aintains the airborne element of this 'triad' of weapons, such that one suspects that the French objective has also been to avoid in-fighting between the three armed services. The nuclear deterrent's airborne element is comprised of a Force de Frappe, which is replacing its thirty-six Dassault Mirage IV twin 14,500-lb-thrust SNECMA Atar 09K-powered jet bombers, capable of Mach 2.0 and a maximum range of 2,000 miles, with a similar number of Mirage 2000Ns in 1988. The single-engined Mirage 2000N, with one reheated Snecma M53-P2, is capable of Mach 2.3 and will operate with the ASMP nuclear missile. Unlike the Mirage IV, which is effectively a 'blown up' and twin-engined version of the Mirage III, the Mirage 2000N has greater commonalty with the Mirage 2000 interceptor and attack aircraft. - Although the RAF no longer has responsibility for the British nuclear deterrent, the Panavia Tornado strike aircraft, of which the RAF has 220 of the interdictor IDS version, known in RAF service as GR.1, is also nuclear-capable. In common with the Mirage 2000N, the Tornado GR.1 has a fighter or interceptor variant as a close relation, although in this case the relationship is reversed, with the strike aircraft being the standard version, for the RAF, the Luftwaffe, Marineflieger and Aeronautica Militare Italiano. The F.2 fighter development was originally developed exclusively for the Royal Air Force, although twenty-four of these are also being supplied to the Royal Saudi Air Force, along with forty-eight of the IDS version. Two Turbo Union RB.199 turbofans give the variable-geometry Tornado a maximum speed of Mach 2.0, although this drops to about Mach 1.2 at sea-level, and a combat radius of 850 miles in the Hi-Lo-Lo-Hi mode. The maximum warload is a worthwhile 20,000 lbs, all of which is carried externally and which is in excess of the normal load of a World War II heavy bomber. It is unlikely that the Italian or German aircraft would carry nuclear weapons, but the continued
