-Western Shah of Iran in January 1979. At the outset of the war, the Iranian Air Force, like the other two services in their own right, was the most powerful in the Middle East. The Shah had created an air arm with almost eighty of the Mach 2.4 Grumman F-14 Tomcat variable-geometry fighter aircraft, plus almost 200 McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers and more than 160 Northrop F-5 Tiger fighter-bombers. Against this, the Syrian Air Force operated more than 300 Mikoyan MiG-21 and MiG-23 combat aircraft, generally inferior to the aircraft operated by the Iranians. although the major difference would have lain in the standard of training and discipline of the opposing forces had not the Khomeini regime purged them on taking power. During the first couple of months of the war, Iraqi aircraft raided towns and cities as well as military installations in Iran, with Iranian retaliation. A significant feature of the air war has been the limited use of air power in support of ground forces, with both sides attempting a war of attrition centred around attacks on economic targets, especially oil fields and terminals, as well as shipping, including that of neutral nations, suspected rightly or wrongly of moving to and from ports in Iraq or Iran. Both sides have received heavy losses, but the Iraqi forces have fared better, due to their ability to purchase aircraft and spares from the USSR and, more recently, France, with Super Etendard aircraft and Exocet air-to-surface missiles being used with great effect against shipping. During 1986 it was thought that the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force had been reduced by attrition and a shortage of spares to no more than a dozen operational F-14A Tomcats, about forty F-4 Phantoms and perhaps fifty F-5s. By contrast, the Iraqi A1 Quwwat Aljawwiya Aliraquiya has a bomber force of twenty Tupolev Tu-16 Badgers and Tu-22 Blinders and has replaced the Super Etendards with the more potent Mirage F.1EQ, of which there are about eight
