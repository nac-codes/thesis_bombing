Quwwat Aljawwiya Aliraquiya has a bomber force of twenty Tupolev Tu-16 Badgers and Tu-22 Blinders and has replaced the Super Etendards with the more potent Mirage F.1EQ, of which there are about eighty, as well as a few elderly Hawker Hunter fighter bombers. The general pattern of warfare has been for Iraqi aircraft to attack shipping some thirty to seventy miles off the Iranian oil terminal 189 at Kharg Island and within sixty miles of the Iranian coast. The F.1EQs have an operational radius of more than 400 miles, and the Exocet missiles are radar guided to their targets, normally hitting tankers close to the superstructure, but well below it, at around the waterline. Iranian attacks are preceded by a reconnaissance patrol by Lockheed P-3C Orion maritime-reconnaissance aircraft or Lockheed C-130E Hercules transports and followed up by F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers using AMG-65B Maverick air-to-surface missiles, which are television guided and can be used only in daylight. The missiles have warheads with at least 125 lbs of high explosive, in the case of one version of the Maverick, although another 300 lbs, and Exocet has 360 lbs. During 1984-5, unguided surface-to-surface missiles were fired at Baghdad, exploding in the centre of the city, while Soviet-built 'Frog' and 'Scud' surface-to-surface missiles have been fired at Iranian towns by the Iraqis. There appears to be little chance of an end to the war in the Gulf, although fortunately the conflict has not spread, in spite of tension between Syria and Iraq, with the former sympathizing with Iran, which has also led to Syrian pressure on Jordan. While some observers believe the war has been prolonged by what may be regarded as the balance of incompetence, there must come a stage when Iranian aircraft cannot be kept operational. There have been some indications that Chinese-built Shenyang F-6, or MiG-19, fighter-bombers have been obtained by Iran, possibly from Pakistan, but it is not clear whether these aircraft h
