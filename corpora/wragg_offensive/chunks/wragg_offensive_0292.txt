than that needed by 180 'V' bombers when the Royal Air Force had responsibility for the nuclear deterrent The smaller crew of the bomber is not the whole picture, since it took almost one hundred men and women to keep one bomber operational, and even when the manpower ashore in support of the Polaris fleet is taken into account, the total is little more than 2,000 men and women for the entire force. Of course, the argument is that the RAF 'V' bomber force did more than just carry a nuclear deterrent, and that is right; the same argument applies to carrier-borne aircraft: the nuclear-powered submarine, whether missile-carrying or a 'hunter-killer' equivalent to a fighter, is a weapon of total war only, while surface vessels and aircraft have other peacetime roles and are of use in more localized conflicts. The reduced importance of the bomber has led to its virtual elimination in all but a few air forces simply because on the one hand missiles are more effective, require fewer men and are more difficult to knock out if 191 submarine-launched, while on the other the improved warload and overall performance of the fighter-bomber has led to a cheaper alternative for a more limited type of war. To match submarine-launched missile reaction times, ideally bombers would have to be kept airborne round the clock throughout the year, and this is something which few nations can afford, especially those so close to the most likely threat, the Warsaw Pact, as to have minutes in which to react. True, the 'four-minute' warning of an incoming ICBM attack which civilians would receive in the British Isles is in fact less than that available to the military. There is before this final four minutes a much longer period of ten minutes or more during which the attack is picked up and then analysed to make sure that it is indeed a threat and not a malfunc- tion, a meteorite or a satellite falling out of orbit. War does not happen by mistake, unless one counts the political miscalculation
