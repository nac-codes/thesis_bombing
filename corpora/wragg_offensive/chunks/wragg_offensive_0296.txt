the incessant heavy bombing endured in Europe and the Far East during World War II. Perhaps if the Allies had not forced unconditional surren- der on the Germans, if the Soviet advance had been checked, surrender would have come much earlier and would have been to the bomber's credit first and foremost. One just cannot tell whether or not this might have been so; it simply remains a tantalizing possibility. Had it been so, there would have been fewer casualties during the last year or so of World War II, and much more of Europe would today be free.
