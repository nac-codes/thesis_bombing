which often are directed at the very society that originally introduced them.31 The Drive Toward Total War To say that Bomber Command was basically an instrument of terror is a harsh indictment and, to some, an unfair one as well. What is beyond dispute is 201 that the area offensive was a watershed event in the development of the concept of total war, or, perhaps more precisely, in the re-introduction of this concept in the contemporary period. Total war-as earlier defined-involves not just the complete mobilization of the resources of the state for military purposes but also the blurring, if not evaporation, of any distinction between the home front and the battle front. In total war, both sectors are fused to create an essentially unbroken and universal field of conflict, and military operations in all parts of this landscape are regarded as not only necessary but legitimate. A paper presented by the British Naval Staff in 1921 to the Committee of Imperial Defence addressed this melancholy development: Nothing can be clearer than the fact that modern war resolves itself into an attempt to throttle the national life. Waged by the whole power of the nation, its ultimate object is to bring pressure on the mass of the enemy people, distressing them by every possible means, so as to compel the enemy's government to submit to terms.32 It need hardly be said that the phenomenon of total war has been one of the more grievous assaults on the human condition in this century. It is also self-evident that it was the development of airpower that provided a powerful impetus to its emergence, since the new technology made it possible to wage war not just on the enemy's soldiers but on the society supporting them. As one leading authority on the development of war has put it, the introduction of the strategic bomber led to "a crisis in the law of war, and a process of barbarization such as had not been seen in Europe since the second half of the seventeenth century."33 This refe
