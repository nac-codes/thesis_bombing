d loud and long.39 The Failure of Imagination When the young British climber Andrew Irving was asked in the 1920s why he wanted to scale Mount Everest, his immortal reply was, "Because it's there." Just so with the introduction of long-range bombers. In the period between 1939 and 1945, the scientists and the technicians developed ever more sophisticated means of applying violence, and in some sense the machines took over control of the war. Because the technology was there, it proved well-nigh irresistible to employ it. As Thomas Murray comments "No one ever has ever made the argument that war ought to be made total. as a matter of reason and right. War simply became more and more total, as a matter of fact and possibility."40 Of course, as a new method of war. 205 strategic bombing raised a whole host of interrelated political, social, eco- nomic, and ethical problems. These were far more difficult problems to solve, particularly in the heat of wartime, than essentially technical matters of bombload and navigational systems. It is a truism that man's social wisdom lags behind his technological wisdom, and the development of atomic weapons has often been cited as an example. The phenomenon of strategic bombing in World War II also stands in testimony to the point. Clearly, one of the reasons for the inability of the decision-makers to place strategic bombing in a broader and more appropriate context is the tendency in war, and particularly in total war, of military operations escalating to the use of all conceivable means. Clausewitz called this the "first principle of war," and it was evident in striking fashion in World War II. Now this does not mean that wars must inevitably degenerate into indiscriminate sav- agery-earlier we argued that the Shermanesque thesis was basically false- but the point is that a tendency in that direction is ever present, and it takes a concerted effort to deal with it. When a relatively novel, new technique of war becomes available,
