iences  of the Great War the theorists viewed strategic bombing far too simplistically . The strategic  bombing  campaign  itself was seen merely as a problem of targeting, but in order to select the most important targets a complex system of specialized  military  intelligence must first be in place. No provisions  had been made for such an intelligence  network. In addition to this, the very concept of frictions had not been seriously considered. Before strategic bombing could commence such factors as weather, maintenance,  training, ordinance, and aircraft capabilities  had to be taken into account. Yet the simplistic Douhetian concept of the self-defending  "battle plane " reflected the firm belief by inter-war theorists and the general public as well, that the bomber could penetrate  enemy air space, strike its target, and safely return. Only operational  experience  in combat would reveal many of the problems  strategic  bombers would face. Once World War II had begun the strategic air war took on a dynamic driven by existing technology  and actual combat conditions,  not by a preconceived  air war doctrine. 44 Michael Sherry's  recent work illustrates  the development of strategic  bombing  as dictated  by the evolution  of existing 32  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 44 --- technology. Technology  and friction  became the masters, not the servant of strategic  bombing practices . "In the case of air war, the multiplicity  of motives involved, the lack of measurable  criteria, and the particular  remoteness  of its consequences  combined to give it a peculiarly  unchecked momentum . 1,45 Ronald Schaffer  has also recently  examined the American  strategic  bombing practices  during World War II and has concluded that, even though virtually every figure involved  in directing  the American  bombing campaign  expressed some "views on the moral issue, " that "moral considerations almost invariably  bowed to what people described  as military necessity.
