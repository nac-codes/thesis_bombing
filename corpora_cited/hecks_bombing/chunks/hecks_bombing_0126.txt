ter fitness and oxygen tests to ensure they could withstand the 30,000ft altitude and ambient air temperature of -50 degrees C. Raids began on 8 July, with three aircraft over Germany. US advisors trained the British crews and in some cases flew on operational missions. But without a tail turret especially, the B-17C's armament proved inadequate, while the weather over northern Europe gave severe icing problems and poor visibility which compromised effectiveness, including of the Sperry Mk 0-1 bomb sight. Several broke up in mid air after Clear Air Turbulence caused a violent spiralling dive. With eight aircraft lost after only 39 sorties, the British assigned surviving Fortresses to the Middle East and Coastal Command. The Americans claimed the Fortresses had been misused by not operating them in formation, but put in train major modifications to the B-17, notably for improved armament. German and Soviet Daylight Bombing on the Eastern Front With the German invasion of the USSR, daylight attacks on the Soviet airfields and communications system were interspersed with raids on Moscow itself, using Ju88 and He111 bombers. On the first three days of the campaign, Moscow was attacked by 127, 115, and 100 bombers respectively. The range allowed fighter escort, although the Soviets were unable to provide much effective fighter opposition. Later, in August, the Germans made heavy fire-bombing attacks against Leningrad. But subsequently, the Luftwaffe's bombers were largely withdrawn from  1941 118 Cal DAYLIGHT BOMBING strategic operations, and assigned instead to tactical support for the ground forces. While this helped to speed the German offensive eastwards, by December 1941 it had also allowed the Soviets to uproot and transport some 1.5 million freight railcar loads of vital factory plant and equipment much further east, where it was now out of reach of the bombers. As the first morning of the German invasion progressed, Soviet bomber units began to react in a manner
