some- thing to the dislike of the imprecise or indiscriminate bombing voiced at various times by American leaders and the American public. It has even been argued-and not altogether implausibly-that precision bombing represented an old and well-anchored tradition in America's military past, that of marksmanship. The precision-bombing strategy was challenging, to say the least. First of all, precision bombing would almost certainly be daylight bombing, which meant that the bomber would need speed, armament, or both for its own defense. Second, the bombsight would have to promise greater accuracy than any previ- ously known. Neither the B-17 Flying Fortress bomber nor the Nor- den bombsight, first tested in 1931, offered any guarantees, but they both seemed promising, so that the concept was pursued. Such apparently was the genesis of that idea sometimes called the "pickle barrel" doctrine of precision bombing. Created and shaped in the dusty classrooms of an Alabama airbase, it would seek a mighty affirmation ten years later in the skies over Germany. ON THE EVE SOMEWHERE IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE FRENCH AIR FORCE is the report of an officer sent to inspect forward air observation posts shortly after mobilization in 1939. In one post the observer on duty had almost none of the equipment he needed in order to make accurate sightings. He could not record the exact time an airplane passed over because his watch did not have a minute hand. Asked to explain the distinguishing characteristics of the Messerschmitt 109, he said he recognized it by the way its engine smoked. Countless episodes of this nature could be found in 1939; drawn together, they tell a story of makeshift and unpreparedness in every aspect of the coming war in the air. In each country, historians tend to write about the shortcomings of their air service as if it were alone in its lack of preparation. In fact, the phe- nomenon was a general one, and its basic causes were common to all the major belligerent
