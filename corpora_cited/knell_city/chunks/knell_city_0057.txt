The fire raid using a mix- ture of H.E. and incendiary bombs and causing firestorms proved the ultimate answer. It was practiced first by the Luftwaffe over Britain starting in September 1940, experiment- ed with and developed further by RAF Bomber Command from 1942 onward, and perfected by the XXI Bomber Command of the Twentieth USAAF attacking Japan from January 1945 until the end of the war. Just to make sure that the area fire raids were efficient and successful, the bomber commanders salted them with phos- phorous and napalm-filled incendiaries which also had fire- cracker-like explosives, to assure that the bombs could not be extinguished and that nobody wanted to go near them. To cur- tail any rescue operations after a raid, delayed high explosives were added. Such raids were considered to influence the morale of the enemy civilians and thereby add a bonus to the physical destruction. Bomber Harris thought the killing of civilians as in Hamburg was a humane method of warfare because it saved the flower of the youth of Britain from being mown down as in World War I.3 Such a statement came from the man who was convinced that area bombing decided the war. On the same page of his memoirs Harris points out that 800,000 Germans  54 To DESTROY A CITY THE ROAD TO AREA BOMBING were starved to death by the British naval blockade in World War I. Does he mean that killing civilians in air raids is a more humane method than starving them to death? An even more extreme position is taken by J. M. Spaight, who states that air power is not a destroyer but a saviour of civilization.4 One must take into account the date of these statements to appreci- ate and discount them. The above view of area bombing was the British version The U.S. version was, until January 1945, different. General A Spaatz said in an interview in 1965 that night bombing alone could not have won the war.5 There was a need for daylight precision bombing as the USAAF practised it. General Ira Eaker said in
