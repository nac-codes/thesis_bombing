McFarland targets the entire notion of precision bombing as pursued by the United States from 1910 through 1945. "Precision," as the reader quickly learns, is a relative term: relative to the time in which it is used. In the First World War, airmen dropped bombs by hand or from crude racks, using equally crude sights that automatically built great imprecision into the whole process. In the post-"Great War" years it was this desire to en- sure precision attack that drove development of the dive bomber-an ill- conceived vehicle that traded great accuracy for marginal survivability. American precision bombing in the Second World War, using optical sights even as sophisticated as the Norden sight that Professor McFarland discusses in detail, often meant bombs dropping an average of several thousand feet from their aiming points. Indeed, one study in 1944 con- cluded that only 7 percent of all American bombs fell within 1,000 feet of their aiming point. But, given the crude technology of the time, this was considered acceptable. (In fact, when the Royal Air Force learned
