It was a problem the Army Air Forces never re- solved (see Figure 10.2). Also affecting accuracy was the size of bombing formations, the order of arrival over the target, and the number of aiming points. The more aircraft, the greater was the chaos, causing the wartime average circular error to increase from 945 feet with three groups to 1,095 feet with nine and 1,140 feet with fifteen or more. Until late 1943 the tactic was to get as many groups over the target as quickly as possible, but bombing analysis showed accuracy declined precipitously based on the order of arrival over the target. Smoke, debris, dust, and exploding bombs obscured the visual aiming of trailing formations. By extending the time over target to inter- vals from two to twenty-five minutes, the second unit saw a 32 percent improvement in accuracy, the third 58 percent, the fourth 105 percent, and the fifth 178 percent. Although the improvement was impressive, the first three groups still averaged over twice as many bombs within 1,000 feet of the target as all other following groups. Finally, based on prewar practice, 175 individual bombardiers aimed for different spots on larger targets to achieve a better distribution of bombs. Again bombing analysis showed better results when all bombardiers aimed at one point.23 By mid-1943
