of bad weather LeMay’s bombers went on alone, bereft of fighter escort and of the diversion which the succeeding force was to supply. Only hours later could the Schweinfurt group make its strike. Enemy fighters took an awful toll of the two American forces. Sixty bombers were downed, and as always during the war, attrition also took other forms—loss of some of the best crews, battle damage to dozens more aircraft, irretrievable time lost when the North African bases could not service LeMay’s planes.  To the bomber commander losses on a given day may mean relatively little. What depleted Eaker’s force was the high level of attrition endured for two months more, capped by the Black Week in October, when 148 Flying Fortresses succumbed, 60 alone in one day’s dual assault on Schweinfurt, along with six hundred crewmen killed or captured. The Eighth had, in the words of the official history, “for the time being lost air superiority over Germany.”24 In fact, it never really had achieved such superiority, and its position was much like what it had been a year earlier. Although the scale of operations was far vaster in 1943 and the penetration far deeper, the considerable damage done to the enemy seemed almost incidental to the issue of the Eighth’s sheer survival.  The Eighth’s bomb strikes had been heavy and punishing, particularly when incendiaries struck delicate equipment used in ball-bearing manufacture. The strikes triggered panic in the German high command. Yet the Nazis never suffered seriously from shortages of antifriction ball bearings; fighter output dipped slightly for a while, then rose again. This is not to say that production reached the level it would otherwise have sustained or that production alone measured enemy strength. But American success primarily took subtle, indirect forms: the strain on the Luftwaffe, particularly the depletion of its best crews, encountered in prolonged combat with the day bombers; lost production time as factories were disper
