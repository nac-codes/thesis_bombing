# Introduction

The Allied strategic bombing campaign of World War II has traditionally been portrayed as a narrative of pragmatic evolution: the abandonment of precision bombing in favor of area bombing as operational realities overwhelmed pre-war doctrine. This thesis challenges this conventional wisdom by revealing a striking paradox—the persistent American commitment to precision bombing throughout the conflict, defying theoretical predictions about the nature of modern warfare.

J.F.C. Fuller's theory of omnistate warfare, which predicts the inexorable progression toward maximum destruction as modern states mobilize their populations for total war, provides a powerful framework for understanding the barbarism of World War II. Yet as this thesis demonstrates, the United States presents an exception to Fuller's theory. Despite operating within an omnistate framework, America maintained a consistent commitment to precision bombing, with empirical data showing that approximately 69% of bombs dropped were precision-targeted rather than area bombing.

My argument proceeds in three stages, each challenging conventional narratives about strategic bombing. First, I demonstrate through comprehensive analysis of United States Strategic Bombing Survey data that precision bombing dominated the American campaign throughout the conflict, with no transition toward area bombing even as the war intensified.

Second, I examine the complex relationship between bombing operations and their media representation. Through analysis of thousands of contemporary newspaper articles, I show that American media maintained a consistent focus on precision bombing, mirroring the actual conduct of the campaign. This challenges simplistic notions of wartime propaganda.

Finally, drawing on Fuller's framework of omnistate warfare while acknowledging its limitations, I argue that America's commitment to precision bombing reflects a distinctive strategic culture that valued efficiency, technological sophistication, and moral restraint even in the crucible of World War II.

## Wars *aux allures déchaînées*
Warfare is interesting not because of its tactical details or ethical quandaries, but because it exposes the underlying values of the society conducting it. The American approach to strategic bombing—with its persistent emphasis on scale over precision—reflects fundamental patterns in how mass societies wage total war. To fully grasp these patterns, we must explore not only the events themselves but also the reasons behind American society's specific choices in warfare.

I introduce the work of J.F.C Fuller as a lens through which to view the American approach to strategic bombing. It is important to acknowledge that Fuller was a problematic figure—a pre-war Nazi sympathizer who attended Hitler's 50th birthday celebration in 1939 as an honored guest. Despite these troubling political affiliations, his analytical framework offers valuable insights into the transformation of warfare in the modern era. As an influential military theorist writing both before and after the war, Fuller identified a causal connection between mass society and the emergence of total war: warfare unlimited in scope and unconstrained by traditional military objectives, involving the mobilization of entire societies and the deliberate targeting of civilian populations. Rather than total war being something invented by the Nazis when they invaded Poland (as one eminent historian has claimed),[^1] we find in Fuller's analysis the very principles that underpin modern states as the driving forces behind the phenomenon of total war.

Before the advent of mass politics, warfare operated within clearly defined limits. As James Q. Whitman demonstrates, wars under monarchical sovereignty were conducted as contained political disputes, with professional armies acting as instruments of statecraft.[^2] Fuller aptly characterizes this earlier form of warfare as an "auction-room" where conflicts, though certainly brutal, remained confined to designated battlefields and did not consume society at large.[^3]

This contained nature of warfare was fundamentally transformed by Rousseau's concept of the "general will." This idea endowed the nation-state with what Fuller terms a "quasi-divine sanction," creating a powerful new mythology around popular majorities' supposed ability to divine and pursue the general interest. Although Fuller regarded this assumption as "patently fallacious," he recognized how it "flattered the popular imagination and unthinkingly was accepted as an article of faith."[^4]

The French Revolution demonstrated the profound implications of this transformation. The fusion of people and state under popular sovereignty fundamentally altered the character of warfare. As Fuller observed, "A new order of living and of killing emerged out of the cry of 'Vive la nation!'" War-making decisions were no longer guided by cabinet politics but by what he calls "the occult powers" of "wealth and public opinion—economics and emotionalism."[^5] When warfare became an expression of the general will, traditional restraints proved powerless against the unleashed passions of the nation.

Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, proved clairvoyant when, speaking to the French National Assembly on May 20, 1790, he anticipated the consequences of placing the power to declare war in the hands of a people's assembly:

> "Your votes will demand of you: will we be better assured of only just and equitable wars if exclusively delegated to an assembly of 700 persons the exercise of the right to make war? Have you foreseen how far the impassioned movements, the exaltation of courage, and the fervent ignition might carry and justify imprudence? ... While one member proposes deliberation, war will be clamored for; you will see around you an army of devotees. You will not be deceived by ministers; nor will you ever deceive yourselves... Behold the free peoples: it is because of more ambitious, more barbarous wars than they have ever undertaken. Behold the political assemblies: it is always under the spell of passion that they have decreed war."[^5.5]

The triumph of popular sovereignty unleashed what Fuller terms "the jinni of popular absolutism" from its "monarchial brass bottle," transforming the auction-room of war into a slaughterhouse.[^6] This transformation stemmed from mass politics' activation of humanity's deeper tribal impulses. Fuller argues that this pattern emerges from our evolutionary heritage: "Man as he is can only be explained by man as he was, and never by man as we would like him to be."[^7] When channeled through mass participation in politics, these ancient tribal loyalties transform political opponents and foreign nations into existential threats to the collective.

It is worth noting that Fuller's theories in his early work, *War and Western Civilization, 1832–1932: A Study of War as a Political Instrument and the Expression of Mass Democracy* (1932), primarily took aim at mass democracy as the root of modernity's crisis. Based on his political affiliations, he initially saw fascism as a potential solution to this crisis. However, in his later work, *The Conduct of War, 1789–1961* (1961), Fuller became more critical of both Nazism and Communism as exemplars of the mass politics madness and emotionality toward war. What Fuller missed in his present was the benefit of our hindsight—the ability to look back at all the various emerging modern societies of his time and identify a common thread between them.

Fuller's analysis leads to a stark conclusion that directly challenges political idealism: "The motive force of [mass politics] is not love of others, it is the hate of all outside the tribe, faction, party or nation."[^8] This tribal hatred, legitimized through popular sovereignty and amplified by mass participation, becomes the driving force behind total war. Drawing from Clausewitz's observation that "War belongs to the province of social life," Fuller argues that modern warfare evolved into "a war of ideas, a conflict between different conceptions of civilization." The general will, rather than promoting universal brotherhood, "predicates total war, and hate is the most puissant of recruiters."

This combination of tribal psychology and mass political institutions transformed warfare into wars of righteousness—conflicts that expressed not merely territorial disputes or political calculations, but fundamental conflicts between entire societies and their ways of life. Warfare in the age of omnistates thus became unbound from traditional limits, pursuing not just military victory but the complete transformation of the enemy society.

Churchill's wartime leadership exemplified this drive toward righteous warfare. His declaration that victory must be achieved "at all costs" and his characterization of the enemy as "a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark, lamentable catalogue of human crime" captured the moral absolutism inherent in omnistate warfare.[^9] In place of the careful calibration of power that had characterized traditional diplomacy, modern mass societies pursued total victory through the complete destruction of their enemies.

This outcome of total war cannot be traced back to any individual, whether it be Churchill or Hitler; it cannot be blamed on the scapegoat of industrialization (a crutch of Marxists and Realists alike). Rather, it stemmed from the inherent nature of the omnistate itself—the unleashing of "the jinni of popular absolutism." When warfare became an expression of the general will, it inevitably took on the character that Fuller described as wars *aux allures déchaînées*—wars of frenzied appearance, unbound from traditional limits and driven by the passionate certainty of righteous conviction.[^10]

Clausewitz famously described warfare as a "remarkable trinity" composed of three forces: the government and its political aims, the military and its professional conduct of operations, and the people with their primal passions and hatreds. In modern omnistates, these three elements often fall out of equilibrium, with the people and their passions assuming unprecedented influence. The revolution in mass politics elevated popular passion from a subordinate force, previously constrained by monarchical authority, to the dominant driver of warfare.

This transformation manifested across various political systems—Liberal Democracy, National Socialism, and Communism—which, despite their apparent differences, shared a fundamental reorientation of political authority around popular sovereignty and mass mobilization. What we call "omnistates" emerged across these seemingly different systems: the German *Volk* identified with the Nazi state, the proletariat with the Soviet Union, and the American people with THE United States. This completed the Clausewitzian triangle, where the edge between the state and the people became fully weighted against the others, unlocking a new, more passionate form of warfare witnessed in World War II.

When such omnistates engage in warfare against one another, the conflict inevitably transcends traditional military or political objectives. The enemy becomes not merely an opposing army or government but a mirror image of one's own society—a totality that must be confronted in its entirety.

This mirroring effect transforms the nature of conflict itself. Victory can no longer be achieved through limited military success or diplomatic compromise. Instead, warfare becomes an existential struggle between competing social orders, demanding nothing less than the complete transformation of the enemy society. The goal shifts from achieving specific political objectives to pursuing total victory through the comprehensive defeat and reconstruction of the opposing nation. We saw this manifest in the race-based conquering and exterminating of the Nazis, the mass rape and scorched earth tactics of Soviet expansion, and the area bombing campaigns of the United States and Britain. The applicability of this framework to the Nazi and Soviet regimes is obvious, but we will see how it also applies to the United States.

At Casablanca, the Combined Chiefs of Staff defined victory as the "progressive destruction and dislocation of the German Military, industrial, and economic system, and the undermining of the morale of the German people."[^11] The RAF's Combined Bomber Offensive was explicitly "designed to so destroy German material facilities as to undermine the willingness and ability of the **German worker** to continue the war,"[^12] as if the German worker was some monolithic entity to be slain.

Most telling was the British Chiefs of Staff's casual reference to bombing as a means to "inflict direct damage on Germany and Germans."[^13] This deliberate distinction between state and people crystallizes how omnistate warfare had evolved to target not just military forces or industrial capacity, but the entire fabric of enemy society. The careful balance of Clausewitz's trinity had given way to a totalizing view that saw these elements as a single, indivisible target for destruction.

When German General Hans-Jürgen von Arnim was captured in Tunisia, General Eisenhower's staff suggested following the traditional military custom of receiving the defeated commander—a practice reflective of the more gentlemanly form of monarchical warfare:

> The custom had its origin in the fact that mercenary soldiers of old had no real enmity toward their opponents. Both sides fought for the love of a fight, out of a sense of duty or, more probably, for money. A captured commander of the eighteenth century was likely to be, for weeks or months, the honored guest of his captor. The tradition that all professional soldiers are really comrades in arms has, in tattered form, persisted to this day.[^14]

But Eisenhower forcefully rejected this tradition.

> For me World War II was far too personal a thing to entertain such feelings. Daily as it progressed there grew within me the conviction that as never before in a war between many nations the forces that stood for human good and men's rights were this time confronted by a completely evil conspiracy with which no compromise could be tolerated.

Most tellingly, Eisenhower frames the conflict in explicitly religious terms:

> Because only by the utter destruction of the Axis was a decent world possible, the war became for me a crusade in the traditional sense of that often misused word.

Here we see one of America's most senior military commanders rejecting the traditional professional courtesies of his station, instead treating the enemy as an absolute moral evil. We see how the general will had transformed even career officers from dispassionate professionals into crusaders against evil.

This shift, however, did not originate within the military establishment but was deeply rooted in and enthusiastically embraced by the American public. Herbert Hyman's wartime polling data illustrates a populace that not only accepted the concept of total war but actively demanded it. By January 1944, an overwhelming 81% of Americans insisted upon Germany's unconditional surrender, with only one in ten respondents willing to consider any alternative.[^15] Significantly, rather than displaying signs of war fatigue, the American public demonstrated a remarkable willingness to endure further sacrifices. In August 1942, 70% of respondents believed that the population had not yet been asked to make sufficient sacrifices for the war effort. Even by April 1944, after prolonged periods of rationing and mobilization, 58% continued to hold the view that additional sacrifices were necessary.[^16] These attitudes were not formed independently by the public alone; undoubtedly, government messaging, media narratives, and wartime propaganda played influential roles. However, attributing this phenomenon exclusively to either state influence or popular sentiment oversimplifies the issue. Rather, it was the reciprocal and reinforcing relationship between the state and its citizens that served as the fundamental driving force behind the emergence and persistence of total war.

Based on this theoretical framework, we would expect the United States' approach to warfare to be overtly destructive rather than precise—to not just acquiesce to area bombing but to actively encourage it—as the emotionality of the populace-state relationship continued to influence the outcome of the war. Others have arrived at similar conclusions through different theoretical paths, as we shall see in the next section. Marxist theorists attribute this destructiveness to industrialization, while operational rationalists argue that area bombing was a tactical necessity. We will demonstrate that both theories are insufficient to explain the actual pattern of bombing during the war.

Most importantly, in Chapter 1 we will examine data from the United States Strategic Bombing Survey to evaluate the precise versus area bombing nature of the air campaign. What we will discover is that, contrary to what our theoretical framework might predict, the United States showed exceptional restraint in this regard. This American exceptionalism in the pursuit of precision bombing, rooted in isolationism and a defiance of the previous world war's carnage, created a unique doctrine of controlled, limited warfare. Understanding how this doctrine was ultimately overrun by the emotional impulses we have discussed is central to comprehending the paradoxical nature of the Allied bombing campaign.
