## The Realist and Moralist Narratives

As we concluded in the introduction, our theoretical framework based on Fuller's analysis of omnistates would predict that the United States' approach to warfare would be overtly destructive rather than precise. Yet the historical record reveals a more complex picture, with the US showing exceptional restraint in its pursuit of precision bombing. To understand this apparent contradiction, we must first examine the existing scholarly perspectives on the Allied bombing campaign.

The current literature offers two competing narratives on the evolution of strategic bombing during World War II. The first, which we term the "Realist" narrative, presents the shift from precision to area bombing as a pragmatic adaptation to operational realities—a natural development from the naivete of "pinpoint" bombing to a more battle-tested approach. The second, which we call the "Moralist" narrative, interprets this shift as the inevitable result of bellicose military leaders willing to do anything to accomplish their objectives, with precision bombing serving merely as public relations cover for the campaign's true destructive intentions.

Before examining these perspectives in detail, it is necessary to define our key terms:
1. Precision bombing refers to the targeting of specific nodes in the enemy's economic network, such as factories, transportation hubs, and oil refineries. The goal of this strategy is to neutralize the enemy's war-making capacity by destroying these key nodes.
2. Area bombing refers to the bombing of a large area, typically a city or industrial area, with the aim of destroying it, its infrastructure, and portions of its workforce. The goal of this strategy is to disrupt economic production and weaken the morale of the civilian population.
3. Strategic bombing refers to the overall campaign, which may include precision bombing, area bombing, or both.

These categories, like our "Realist" and "Moralist" frameworks, are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive. No author fits neatly into one category, but they provide a helpful framework for understanding the scholarly landscape.

We begin with the Realist perspective. The main argument of the Realist perspective is that the theory of precision bombing, developed at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama over the decade preceding WWII, was not applicable under real-world wartime conditions. Pre-war theorists had approached strategic bombing too simplistically, viewing it merely as a targeting problem while failing to account for the complex military intelligence network required or the various frictions of war such as weather, maintenance, training, ordinance, and aircraft capabilities. As [Griffith (1994)](./corpora_cited/griffith_hansell/chunks/griffith_hansell_0031.txt) notes, "Only operational experience in combat would reveal many of the problems strategic bombers would face. Once World War II had begun the strategic air war took on a dynamic driven by existing technology and actual combat conditions, not by a preconceived air war doctrine." The reality of warfare meant that "technology and friction became the masters, not the servant of strategic bombing practices," leading to a significant departure from pre-war theoretical frameworks.

The technical and operational challenges of precision bombing proved to be far more daunting than pre-war theorists had anticipated. As [McFarland (1995)](./corpora_cited/mcfarland_pursuit/chunks/mcfarland_pursuit_0001.txt) reveals, even with sophisticated equipment like the Norden bombsight, accuracy remained elusive: "one study in 1944 concluded that only 7 percent of all American bombs fell within 1,000 feet of their aiming point."[^1]

The unescorted bomber doctrine proved particularly costly. [Builder (1994)](./corpora_cited/builder_icarus/chunks/builder_icarus_0107.txt) explains that "The invincibility of the unescorted bomber formation was an article of faith; Flying Fortress was no idle choice of name for the B-17." This faith would be shattered by reality - as demonstrated by the devastating Schweinfurt and Regensburg raids of 1943, which saw loss rates as high as 20½ percent.[^2]

The sheer scale required for "precision" attacks further undermined their practicality. According to [Beagle (2001)](./corpora_cited/beagle_pointblank/chunks/beagle_pointblank_0007.txt), even after achieving air superiority in 1944, a precision bombing mission against a single target required approximately 1,000 aircraft. Moreover, "the minimum bomb pattern bombers could deliver was typically larger than the area of the industrial plant being targeted," making precise targeting of specific components within facilities essentially impossible. These limitations meant that bombing campaigns against specific target sets like ball bearing production, aircraft manufacturing, or transportation infrastructure required months of sustained operations, allowing other target sets time to recover and demonstrating the resilience of the German war economy.

The narrative of the operational hazards of precision bombing typically climaxes with the notorious Schweinfurt raids. Schweinfurt was designated as a target because of the concentration of ball bearing production there, producing an estimated half of these mechanical devices essential to the functioning of automotive engines and industrial machinery. The October 14 mission was disastrous: "Of the 291 bombers dispatched, 198 of them were shot down or damaged." This raid finally shattered the "theory of the self-defending bomber," revealing the limitations of the doctrine that had justified unescorted bombing operations.

These operational challenges and especially the heavy losses during the Schweinfurt raids are employed to provide a rationale for the shift if not towards area bombing than at least away from precision bombing. To explain the shift towards area bombing there are both technical and theoretical arguments that have been put forth. The former describes the development of incendiary bomb technology as the driver of the allied approach to war. As [Knell (2003)](./corpora_cited/knell_city/chunks/knell_city_0057.txt) notes, "The fire raid using a mixture of H.E. and incendiary bombs and causing firestorms proved the ultimate answer," with these tactics being "practiced first by the Luftwaffe over Britain starting in September 1940, experimented with and developed further by RAF Bomber Command from 1942 onward."[^3]

This technological argument is supplemented by several theoretical arguments justifying the shift to area bombing. The first stems from the claim that Germany had initiated city attacks, thereby setting the precedent. As [Garrett (1993)](./corpora_cited/garrett_ethics/chunks/garrett_ethics_0025.txt) notes, "the Germans had after all initiated city attacks-first with the bombing of Warsaw, then the assault on Rotterdam in May 1940 (which was said to have caused 30,000 fatalities), and finally with the blitz on Britain itself."[^4]

A second theoretical justification arose from the concept of total war, which blurred traditional distinctions between combatants and civilians. As [Garrett (1993)](./corpora_cited/garrett_ethics/chunks/garrett_ethics_0300.txt) explains, total war "involves not just the complete mobilization of the resources of the state for military purposes but also the blurring, if not evaporation, of any distinction between the home front and the battle front."

This blurring of lines between civilian and military targets was further justified by the argument that industrial workers were legitimate military targets. [Buckley (1999)](./corpora_cited/buckley_total/chunks/buckley_total_0010.txt) poses the question: "Why would those organizing and supporting the war effort in Germany be less of a legitimate target than soldiers fighting at the front, especially in an age when most soldiers are conscripts and may have been indifferent supporters of or even hostile to the Nazi regime?"[^5]

Finally, these various justifications were ultimately supported by the pragmatic argument that area bombing was effective and helped bring the war to a swift conclusion. As [Buckley (1999)](./corpora_cited/buckley_total/chunks/buckley_total_0008.txt) argues, "the conduct of war throughout history has been influenced less by morality and more by military capability, balanced by political acceptability." The key factor became simply whether a strategy would "allow you to win and bring the war to a speedy conclusion."[^5.5] [^6]

The Realist perspective therefore may be summed up as follows: War has an inherent tendency toward escalation and brutality, as articulated by Clausewitz's observation that "war is an act of force which theoretically can have no limits." The shift from precision to area bombing was not driven by malice or bloodlust, but rather by what [Garrett 1993](./corpora_cited/garrett_ethics/chunks/garrett_ethics_0306.txt) describes as "the tendency in war, and particularly in total war, of military operations escalating to the use of all conceivable means."

The Moralist perspective contends that the distinction between precision and area bombing was largely rhetorical—a facade maintained to obscure the truly destructive and immoral nature of strategic bombing. [Sherry (1987)](./corpora_cited/sherry_armageddon/chunks/sherry_armageddon_0298.txt) notes that while "much was made about a distinction between British night bombing to terrorize German cities and American daylight precision bombing designed to immobilize the enemy's war-making capacity," this distinction "had never been clearly drawn in American doctrine."[^7]

The evidence of this duplicity, the Moralists argue, can be found in the actual conduct of the bombing campaign. [Downes (2008)](./corpora_cited/downes_strategic/chunks/downes_strategic_0005.txt) points out that "The U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II launched seventy self-described attacks on a 'city area' in Germany," and devoted "about half of their total effort to radar bombing, which—although not purposefully directed at civilians—American military officers knew was the functional equivalent of British area bombing."[^8]

[Maier (2005)](./corpora_cited/maier_city/chunks/maier_city_0011.txt) describes how the U.S. "clung to shrouding large-scale bombing with particular industrial or strategic objectives," even as the logic of bombing shifted from precision to pure destruction. By the end of the war, the justification had evolved from targeting specific military objectives to a broader theory that "the more destruction there was, the sooner the collapse would come."

Vengeance and emotion, this perspective argues, rather than military necessity, were the true drivers behind the strategic bombing campaign. This narrative, most notably advocated by Michael Sherry, points to the rhetoric surrounding bombing campaigns as evidence. As [Sherry (1987)](./corpora_cited/sherry_armageddon/chunks/sherry_armageddon_0747.txt) documents, public discourse was filled with emotional calls for "socking the rapacious German nation" and "repayment for Nazi crimes" - language that betrayed motivations far removed from rational military calculus.[^9]

This emotional drive for vengeance was enabled by what Sherry terms "amoral technicians" within the military bureaucracy. [Sherry (1987)](./corpora_cited/sherry_armageddon/chunks/sherry_armageddon_1300.txt) describes how "airmen placed operational considerations first and said little about the enemy, rarely employing the rhetoric of vengeance found elsewhere." Through this technical, methodological approach, "the air force could serve as a vehicle of vengeance while confining itself to the problems of technique."[^12]

The moral justification offered for this escalation was, according to [Sherry (1987)](./corpora_cited/sherry_armageddon/chunks/sherry_armageddon_0757.txt), dangerously open-ended. While Americans "acknowledged the widespread killing of civilians, accepted their innocence, labeled their killing murder," they then "designated it as justifiable homicide, as the only recourse if victory were to be secured and Allied casualties minimized." This reasoning "could justify almost any action that accelerated triumph."

Moralists have also argued that total war actually elongates rather than shortens conflict. The French Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain, as cited by [Sherry (1987)](./corpora_cited/sherry_armageddon/chunks/sherry_armageddon_0396.txt), argued that "terror and total war prolonged war. They defeated the very end of victory by arousing resistance, and they poisoned the peace thereafter as well."

## Synthesis

Both the Realist and Moralist perspectives offer valuable insights into the evolution of strategic bombing during World War II, yet neither fully explains the paradox we identified in the introduction: the persistence of both precision and area bombing throughout the conflict. The Realist narrative, with its emphasis on operational necessity, fails to account for why precision bombing continued despite its apparent ineffectiveness. The Moralist narrative, focused on the moral failings of military leadership, cannot explain why genuine efforts at precision targeting persisted alongside area bombing.

What both perspectives miss is the sociopolitical dimension we explored through Fuller's analysis of omnistates. The emotional dynamics of mass politics created powerful pressures toward destructive warfare, yet the American commitment to precision bombing—however imperfect in execution—represented a genuine attempt to resist these pressures. This tension between the emotional imperatives of omnistate warfare and America's exceptional restraint in pursuing precision bombing is the central paradox that our analysis will address.

In the next chapter, we will move beyond these theoretical frameworks to examine the empirical evidence from the United States Strategic Bombing Survey. By analyzing the actual pattern of bombing operations throughout the war, we will demonstrate that neither the Realist nor the Moralist narrative adequately explains the complex reality of the Allied bombing campaign. Instead, we will show how the persistence of both precision and area bombing reflects the fundamental tension between rational military objectives and the emotional dynamics of omnistate warfare.

[^1]: For more information on bombing accuracy, see: [Crane 2016](./corpora_cited/crane_bombs/chunks/crane_bombs_0147.txt) emphasizes that while American airpower had confidence in the Norden bombsight, the anticipated precision was hard to achieve, with only about 14% of bombs landing within 1,000 feet of their targets during early 1943. [McFarland 1995](./corpora_cited/mcfarland_pursuit/chunks/mcfarland_pursuit_0251.txt) discusses the challenges that altitude and large bombing formations posed to accuracy, noting that bomb patterns became increasingly imprecise as formation size and altitude increased. [Parks 1945](./corpora_cited/parks_preciscion/chunks/parks_preciscion_0005.txt) describes how 'bombing on leader' formations, adopted for practical reasons, led to larger bombing patterns and a lower level of accuracy than originally anticipated for precision bombing.

[^2]: For more information on the challenges and assumptions surrounding bomber escort and self-defense capabilities, see: [Biddle 2002](./corpora_cited/biddle_rhetoric/chunks/biddle_rhetoric_0272.txt) examines how American planners believed in the viability of the "self-defending" bomber, relying on speed, altitude, and armament for unescorted penetration. This view persisted despite underlying doubts and logistical challenges, until wartime experience revealed its flaws. [Werrell 2009](./corpora_cited/werrell_death/chunks/werrell_death_0062.txt) discusses how American bomber advocates underestimated the need for escorts, firmly believing in the superiority of bombers in mutual defense formations, and failing to predict advancements in defensive technology, such as radar. [Hecks 1990](./corpora_cited/hecks_bombing/chunks/hecks_bombing_0126.txt) details the early struggles with the B-17, noting that inadequate armament and harsh European weather conditions led to high losses, showing that unescorted bombers faced significant operational challenges.

[^3]: [Werrell 2009](./corpora_cited/werrell_death/chunks/werrell_death_0175.txt) details the severe costs of the Schweinfurt raid, stating that "does not inflict decisive damage, cannot be followed up, and merits the award of five of the nation's highest decoration deserves sharp criticism." [Kohn 1988](./corpora_cited/interview_strategic/chunks/interview_strategic_0035.txt) includes firsthand account from Leon Johnson (one of the first four flying officers in the 8th Air Force) describing the Schweinfurt missions as "one of the most hazardous missions in the whole war," underscoring the intense five-hour battles fought over Schweinfurt. Additionally, [Crane 2016](./corpora_cited/crane_bombs/chunks/crane_bombs_0017.txt) argues that while precision bombing was initially seen as both efficient and humane, the pressures of war and technological limitations led commanders to prioritize military objectives over moral considerations. As he notes, "once LeMay became convinced that pinpoint tactics were no longer effective, morality alone was not enough to prevent the firebombing of Tokyo." The growing pressure to end an increasingly bloody war, combined with vast fleets of bombers that "could not just sit idle, despite poor weather," pushed commanders toward more destructive tactics.

[^4]: [Lucien (1971)](./corpora_cited/lucien_pinpoint/chunks/lucien_pinpoint_0036.txt) cites Donald Wilson (USAF General) who stated that "Modern industrial nations are susceptible to defeat by interruption of this web" and that "morale collapse brought about by the breaking of this closely knit web will be sufficient."

[^5]: The argument about civilian culpability was further developed by [Garrett (1993)](./corpora_cited/garrett_ethics/chunks/garrett_ethics_0300.txt) who noted that airpower made it "possible to wage war not just on the enemy's soldiers but on the society supporting them," leading to what one authority called "a crisis in the law of war, and a process of barbarization such as had not been seen in Europe since the second half of the seventeenth century." The rhetoric used here, however, might be categorized in the "Moralist" camp.

[^5.5]: [Crane 2016](./corpora_cited/crane_bombs/chunks/crane_bombs_0018.txt) explains that the overriding objective was winning the war quickly and efficiently with minimal American casualties, which often prevented morality from being an "overriding criterion." He notes that while some planners took comfort in proposals that would minimize civilian casualties, the need for Allied cooperation led the US to mute ethical arguments since Britain strongly supported attacking civilian morale. The Americans wanted to avoid causing rifts with their allies or aiding German propaganda.

[^6]: The evolution of this doctrine is traced by [Buckley (1999)](./corpora_cited/buckley_total/chunks/buckley_total_0009.txt) who notes that during WWI, bombing strategy "accepted that inaccurate bombs would hit and kill civilians and this was acceptable because it would damage enemy morale." While this targeting of civilians "declined as a strategy in the 1930s," it "re-emerged during the Second World War in the RAF once it proved impossible to bomb anything accurately." [Maier (2005)](./corpora_cited/maier_city/chunks/maier_city_0009.txt) describes how early in the war, the British moved to define "collateral damage" as an updated version of the medieval just-war doctrine of "double effect" - if civilians were killed while pursuing legitimate military objectives, this was acceptable as long as care was taken to minimize casualties and observe proportionality.

[^7]: This interpretation is supported by [Sherry (1987)](./corpora_cited/sherry_armageddon/chunks/sherry_armageddon_0298.txt) who notes that "In the 1930s, Americans never decisively opted for the enemy's war-making capacity as their objective. They proposed to attack the enemy's will, only by more humane and economical methods." The distinction between attacking war-making capacity and civilian will was thus blurred from the beginning.

[^8]: The emotional nature of public discourse around bombing is further evidenced by [Sherry (1987)](./corpora_cited/sherry_armageddon/chunks/sherry_armageddon_0747.txt) who notes that when Vera Brittain published a critique of bombing in 1944, the responses revealed "the mood of vengeance usually shrouded by utilitarian arguments for bombing."

[^9]: The casualness of moral debate around bombing is particularly striking. [Sherry (1987)](./corpora_cited/sherry_armageddon/chunks/sherry_armageddon_0757.txt) attributes this not just to "moral laziness" but to the circumstances of air war itself: "Americans entered the war with little tradition of realistic debate about air power to draw upon... journalists and politicians were ill-equipped or disinclined to raise moral issues."

[^12]: This interpretation helps explain why, as [Sherry (1987)](./corpora_cited/sherry_armageddon/chunks/sherry_armageddon_0757.txt) noted earlier, moral debates about bombing remained "casual" despite their gravity. If war itself is seen as inherently immoral, then debates about specific tactics become merely technical rather than ethical questions.
