## The Realist and Moralist Narratives

The current literature offers two competing narratives on the evolution of strategic bombing during World War II. The first, which we term the "Realist" narrative, presents the shift from precision to area bombing as a pragmatic adaptation to operational realities—a natural development from the naivete of "pinpoint" bombing to a more battle-tested approach. The second, which we call the "Moralist" narrative, interprets this shift as the inevitable result of bellicose military leaders willing to do anything to accomplish their objectives, with precision bombing serving merely as public relations cover for the campaign's true destructive intentions.

Before examining these perspectives in detail, it is necessary to define our key terms:
1. Precision bombing refers to the targeting of specific nodes in the enemy's economic network, such as factories, transportation hubs, and oil refineries. The goal of this strategy is to neutralize the enemy's war-making capacity by destroying these key nodes.
2. Area bombing refers to the bombing of a large area, typically a city or industrial area, with the aim of destroying it, its infrastructure, and portions of its workforce. The goal of this strategy is to disrupt economic production and weaken the morale of the civilian population.
3. Strategic bombing refers to the overall campaign, which may include precision bombing, area bombing, or both.

These categories, like our "Realist" and "Moralist" frameworks, are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive. No author fits neatly into one category, but they provide a helpful framework for understanding the scholarly landscape.

We begin with the Realist perspective. The main argument of the Realist perspective is that the theory of precision bombing, developed at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama over the decade preceding WWII, was not applicable under real-world wartime conditions. Pre-war theorists had approached strategic bombing too simplistically, viewing it merely as a targeting problem while failing to account for the complex military intelligence network required or the various frictions of war such as weather, maintenance, training, ordinance, and aircraft capabilities. As [Griffith (1994)](./corpora_cited/griffith_hansell/chunks/griffith_hansell_0031.txt) notes, "Only operational experience in combat would reveal many of the problems strategic bombers would face. Once World War II had begun the strategic air war took on a dynamic driven by existing technology and actual combat conditions, not by a preconceived air war doctrine." The reality of warfare meant that "technology and friction became the masters, not the servant of strategic bombing practices," leading to a significant departure from pre-war theoretical frameworks.[^1]

The technical and operational challenges of precision bombing proved to be far more daunting than pre-war theorists had anticipated. As [McFarland (1995)](./corpora_cited/mcfarland_pursuit/chunks/mcfarland_pursuit_0001.txt) reveals, even with sophisticated equipment like the Norden bombsight, accuracy remained elusive: "one study in 1944 concluded that only 7 percent of all American bombs fell within 1,000 feet of their aiming point."[^2]

The unescorted bomber doctrine proved particularly costly. [Builder (1994)](./corpora_cited/builder_icarus/chunks/builder_icarus_0107.txt) explains that "The invincibility of the unescorted bomber formation was an article of faith; Flying Fortress was no idle choice of name for the B-17." This faith would be shattered by reality - as demonstrated by the devastating Schweinfurt and Regensburg raids of 1943, which saw loss rates as high as 20½ percent.[^3]

The sheer scale required for "precision" attacks further undermined their practicality. According to [Beagle (2001)](./corpora_cited/beagle_pointblank/chunks/beagle_pointblank_0007.txt), even after achieving air superiority in 1944, a precision bombing mission against a single target required approximately 1,000 aircraft. Moreover, "the minimum bomb pattern bombers could deliver was typically larger than the area of the industrial plant being targeted," making precise targeting of specific components within facilities essentially impossible.[^4] These limitations meant that bombing campaigns against specific target sets like ball bearing production, aircraft manufacturing, or transportation infrastructure required months of sustained operations, allowing other target sets time to recover and demonstrating the resilience of the German war economy.

The narrative of the operational hazards of precision bombing typically climaxes with the notorious Schweinfurt raids. Schweinfurt was designated as a target because of the concentration of ball bearing production there, producing an estimated half of these mechanical devices essential to the functioning of automotive engines and industrial machinery. The October 14 mission was disastrous: "Of the 291 bombers dispatched, 198 of them were shot down or damaged." This raid finally shattered the "theory of the self-defending bomber," revealing the limitations of the doctrine that had justified unescorted bombing operations.

These operational challenges and especially the heavy losses during the Schweinfurt raids are employed to provide a rationale for the shift if not towards area bombing than at least away from precision bombing. To explain the shift towards area bombing there are both technical and theoretical arguments that have been put forth. The former describes the development of incendiary bomb technology as the driver of the allied approach to war. As [Knell (2003)](./corpora_cited/knell_city/chunks/knell_city_0057.txt) notes, "The fire raid using a mixture of H.E. and incendiary bombs and causing firestorms proved the ultimate answer," with these tactics being "practiced first by the Luftwaffe over Britain starting in September 1940, experimented with and developed further by RAF Bomber Command from 1942 onward."[^5]

This technological argument is supplemented by several theoretical arguments justifying the shift to area bombing. The first stems from the claim that Germany had initiated city attacks, thereby setting the precedent. As [Garrett (1993)](./corpora_cited/garrett_ethics/chunks/garrett_ethics_0025.txt) notes, "the Germans had after all initiated city attacks-first with the bombing of Warsaw, then the assault on Rotterdam in May 1940 (which was said to have caused 30,000 fatalities), and finally with the blitz on Britain itself."[^6]

A second theoretical justification arose from the concept of total war, which blurred traditional distinctions between combatants and civilians. As [Garrett (1993)](./corpora_cited/garrett_ethics/chunks/garrett_ethics_0300.txt) explains, total war "involves not just the complete mobilization of the resources of the state for military purposes but also the blurring, if not evaporation, of any distinction between the home front and the battle front."[^7]

This blurring of lines between civilian and military targets was further justified by the argument that industrial workers were legitimate military targets. [Buckley (1999)](./corpora_cited/buckley_total/chunks/buckley_total_0010.txt) poses the question: "Why would those organizing and supporting the war effort in Germany be less of a legitimate target than soldiers fighting at the front, especially in an age when most soldiers are conscripts and may have been indifferent supporters of or even hostile to the Nazi regime?"[^8]

Finally, these various justifications were ultimately supported by the pragmatic argument that area bombing was effective and helped bring the war to a swift conclusion. As [Buckley (1999)](./corpora_cited/buckley_total/chunks/buckley_total_0008.txt) argues, "the conduct of war throughout history has been influenced less by morality and more by military capability, balanced by political acceptability." The key factor became simply whether a strategy would "allow you to win and bring the war to a speedy conclusion."[^9] [^10]

The Realist perspective therefore may be summed up as follows: War has an inherent tendency toward escalation and brutality, as articulated by Clausewitz's observation that "war is an act of force which theoretically can have no limits." The shift from precision to area bombing was not driven by malice or bloodlust, but rather by what [Garrett 1993](./corpora_cited/garrett_ethics/chunks/garrett_ethics_0306.txt) describes as "the tendency in war, and particularly in total war, of military operations escalating to the use of all conceivable means."[^11]

The Moralist perspective contends that the distinction between precision and area bombing was largely rhetorical—a facade maintained to obscure the truly destructive and immoral nature of strategic bombing. [Sherry (1987)](./corpora_cited/sherry_armageddon/chunks/sherry_armageddon_0298.txt) notes that while "much was made about a distinction between British night bombing to terrorize German cities and American daylight precision bombing designed to immobilize the enemy's war-making capacity," this distinction "had never been clearly drawn in American doctrine."[^12]

The evidence of this duplicity, the Moralists argue, can be found in the actual conduct of the bombing campaign. [Downes (2008)](./corpora_cited/downes_strategic/chunks/downes_strategic_0005.txt) points out that "The U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II launched seventy self-described attacks on a 'city area' in Germany," and devoted "about half of their total effort to radar bombing, which—although not purposefully directed at civilians—American military officers knew was the functional equivalent of British area bombing."[^13]

[Maier (2005)](./corpora_cited/maier_city/chunks/maier_city_0011.txt) describes how the U.S. "clung to shrouding large-scale bombing with particular industrial or strategic objectives," even as the logic of bombing shifted from precision to pure destruction. By the end of the war, the justification had evolved from targeting specific military objectives to a broader theory that "the more destruction there was, the sooner the collapse would come."[^14]

Vengeance and emotion, this perspective argues, rather than military necessity, were the true drivers behind the strategic bombing campaign. This narrative, most notably advocated by Michael Sherry, points to the rhetoric surrounding bombing campaigns as evidence. As [Sherry (1987)](./corpora_cited/sherry_armageddon/chunks/sherry_armageddon_0747.txt) documents, public discourse was filled with emotional calls for "socking the rapacious German nation" and "repayment for Nazi crimes" - language that betrayed motivations far removed from rational military calculus.[^15]

This emotional drive for vengeance was enabled by what Sherry terms "amoral technicians" within the military bureaucracy. [Sherry (1987)](./corpora_cited/sherry_armageddon/chunks/sherry_armageddon_1300.txt) describes how "airmen placed operational considerations first and said little about the enemy, rarely employing the rhetoric of vengeance found elsewhere." Through this technical, methodological approach, "the air force could serve as a vehicle of vengeance while confining itself to the problems of technique."[^16]

The moral justification offered for this escalation was, according to [Sherry (1987)](./corpora_cited/sherry_armageddon/chunks/sherry_armageddon_0757.txt), dangerously open-ended. While Americans "acknowledged the widespread killing of civilians, accepted their innocence, labeled their killing murder," they then "designated it as justifiable homicide, as the only recourse if victory were to be secured and Allied casualties minimized." This reasoning "could justify almost any action that accelerated triumph."[^17]

Moralists have also argued that total war actually elongates rather than shortens conflict. The French Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain, as cited by [Sherry (1987)](./corpora_cited/sherry_armageddon/chunks/sherry_armageddon_0396.txt), argued that "terror and total war prolonged war. They defeated the very end of victory by arousing resistance, and they poisoned the peace thereafter as well."[^18]

As he notes, "once LeMay became convinced that pinpoint tactics were no longer effective, morality alone was not enough to prevent the firebombing of Tokyo." The growing pressure to end an increasingly bloody war, combined with vast fleets of bombers that "could not just sit idle, despite poor weather," pushed commanders toward more destructive tactics.

The rhetoric used here, however, might be categorized in the "Moralist" camp.

He notes that while some planners took comfort in proposals that would minimize civilian casualties, the need for Allied cooperation led the US to mute ethical arguments since Britain strongly supported attacking civilian morale. The Americans wanted to avoid causing rifts with their allies or aiding German propaganda.

UCL Press, 1999, p. 9.](./corpora_cited/buckley_total/chunks/buckley_total_0009.txt) who notes that during WWI, bombing strategy "accepted that inaccurate bombs would hit and kill civilians and this was acceptable because it would damage enemy morale." While this targeting of civilians "declined as a strategy in the 1930s," it "re-emerged during the Second World War in the RAF once it proved impossible to bomb anything accurately."

International Review of the Red Cross, 2005, p. 9.](./corpora_cited/maier_city/chunks/maier_city_0009.txt) describes how early in the war, the British moved to define "collateral damage" as an updated version of the medieval just-war doctrine of "double effect" - if civilians were killed while pursuing legitimate military objectives, this was acceptable as long as care was taken to minimize casualties and observe proportionality.

## Wars *aux allures déchaînées*

While the Realist and Moralist perspectives dominate conventional historical discourse on strategic bombing, neither framework fully explains the transformation of warfare in the modern era. To move beyond these limited perspectives, this section considers broader social and political developments that J.F.C. Fuller argues fundamentally changed the nature of warfare itself. Major-General John Frederick Charles (J.F.C.) Fuller (1878-1966), a British Army officer, military historian, and strategist renowned for his pioneering theories on mechanized warfare and extensive writings on military history, provides key insights into how modern warfare evolved according to his theoretical framework, despite his troubling personal history.

Fuller offers a third perspective that locates the origins of total war not in technological limitations or the moral failings of military leadership, but in the fundamental transformation of the relationship between citizens and the state in the modern era. As an influential military theorist writing both before and after the war, Fuller identified a causal connection between mass society and the emergence of total war: warfare unlimited in scope and unconstrained by traditional military objectives, involving the mobilization of entire societies and the deliberate targeting of civilian populations. Rather than total war being something invented by the Nazis when they invaded Poland (as one eminent historian has claimed),[^19] Fuller's analysis suggests the very principles that underpin modern states as the driving forces behind the phenomenon of total war.

Fuller argues that before the advent of mass politics, warfare operated within clearly defined limits. As James Q. Whitman demonstrates, wars under monarchical sovereignty were conducted as contained political disputes, with professional armies acting as instruments of statecraft.[^20] Fuller aptly characterizes this earlier form of warfare as an "auction-room" where conflicts, though certainly brutal, remained confined to designated battlefields and did not consume society at large.[^21]

According to Fuller, this contained nature of warfare was fundamentally transformed by Rousseau's concept of the "general will." This idea endowed the nation-state with what Fuller terms a "quasi-divine sanction," creating a powerful new mythology around popular majorities' supposed ability to divine and pursue the general interest. Although Fuller regarded this assumption as "patently fallacious," he recognized how it "flattered the popular imagination and unthinkingly was accepted as an article of faith."[^22]

Fuller observed that the French Revolution demonstrated the profound implications of this transformation. The fusion of people and state under popular sovereignty fundamentally altered the character of warfare. As Fuller noted, "A new order of living and of killing emerged out of the cry of 'Vive la nation!'" War-making decisions were no longer guided by cabinet politics but by what he calls "the occult powers" of "wealth and public opinion—economics and emotionalism."[^23] In Fuller's view, when warfare became an expression of the general will, traditional restraints proved powerless against the unleashed passions of the nation.

Fuller cites Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, who proved clairvoyant when, speaking to the French National Assembly on May 20, 1790, he anticipated the consequences of placing the power to declare war in the hands of a people's assembly:

> "I ask you yourselves: will we be better assured of having only just, equitable wars if we exclusively delegate the exercise of the right to wage war to an assembly of 700 people? Have you foreseen how far passionate movements, how far the exaltation of courage and false dignity could carry and justify imprudence...? While one of the members will propose to deliberate, war will be demanded with loud cries; you will see around you an army of citizens. You will not be deceived by ministers; will you never be deceived by yourselves?... Look at free peoples: it is through more ambitious, more barbaric wars that they have always distinguished themselves. Look at political assemblies: it is always under the spell of passion that they have decreed war."[^24]

Fuller argues that the triumph of popular sovereignty unleashed what he terms "the jinni of popular absolutism" from its "monarchial brass bottle," transforming the auction-room of war into a slaughterhouse.[^25] In his view, this transformation stemmed from mass politics' activation of humanity's deeper tribal impulses. Fuller contends that this pattern emerges from our evolutionary heritage: "Man as he is can only be explained by man as he was, and never by man as we would like him to be."[^26] According to Fuller, when channeled through mass participation in politics, these ancient tribal loyalties transform political opponents and foreign nations into existential threats to the collective.

It is worth noting that Fuller's theories in his early work, *War and Western Civilization, 1832–1932: A Study of War as a Political Instrument and the Expression of Mass Democracy* (1932), primarily took aim at mass democracy as the root of modernity's crisis. Based on his political affiliations, he initially saw fascism as a potential solution to this crisis. However, in his later work, *The Conduct of War, 1789–1961* (1961), Fuller became more critical of both Nazism and Communism as exemplars of the mass politics madness and emotionality toward war. What Fuller missed in his present was the benefit of our hindsight—the ability to look back at all the various emerging modern societies of his time and identify a common thread between them.

Fuller's analysis leads to a stark conclusion that directly challenges political idealism: "The motive force of [mass politics] is not love of others, it is the hate of all outside the tribe, faction, party or nation."[^27] In Fuller's framework, this tribal hatred, legitimized through popular sovereignty and amplified by mass participation, becomes the driving force behind total war. Drawing from Clausewitz's observation that "War belongs to the province of social life," Fuller argues that modern warfare evolved into "a war of ideas, a conflict between different conceptions of civilization." The general will, rather than promoting universal brotherhood, "predicates total war, and hate is the most puissant of recruiters."

This combination of tribal psychology and mass political institutions transformed warfare into wars of righteousness—conflicts that expressed not merely territorial disputes or political calculations, but fundamental conflicts between entire societies and their ways of life. In his view, warfare in the age of modern mass societies thus became unbound from traditional limits, pursuing not just military victory but the complete transformation of the enemy society.

Churchill's wartime leadership, according to Fuller, exemplified this drive toward righteous warfare. Churchill's declaration that victory must be achieved "at all costs" and his characterization of the enemy as "a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark, lamentable catalogue of human crime" captured the moral absolutism inherent in modern mass society warfare. In place of the careful calibration of power that had characterized traditional diplomacy, Fuller observed that modern mass societies pursued total victory through the complete destruction of their enemies.[^28]

According to Fuller's analysis, this outcome of total war cannot be traced back to any individual, whether it be Churchill or Hitler; it cannot be blamed on the scapegoat of industrialization (a crutch of Marxists and Realists alike). Rather, he argues it stemmed from the inherent nature of modern mass society itself—the unleashing of "the jinni of popular absolutism." When warfare became an expression of the general will, Fuller contends it inevitably took on the character that he described as wars *aux allures déchaînées*—wars of frenzied appearance, unbound from traditional limits and driven by the passionate certainty of righteous conviction.[^29]

Fuller draws on Clausewitz, who famously described warfare as a "remarkable trinity" composed of three forces: the government and its political aims, the military and its professional conduct of operations, and the people with their primal passions and hatreds. In Fuller's view, in modern mass societies, these three elements often fall out of equilibrium, with the people and their passions assuming unprecedented influence. He argues that the revolution in mass politics elevated popular passion from a subordinate force, previously constrained by monarchical authority, to the dominant driver of warfare.

Fuller suggests that this transformation manifested across various political systems—Liberal Democracy, National Socialism, and Communism—which, despite their apparent differences, shared a fundamental reorientation of political authority around popular sovereignty and mass mobilization. These mass societies functioned in a way that blurred traditional distinctions between state and populace: the German *Volk* identified with the Nazi state, the proletariat with the Soviet Union, and the American people with the United States. In Fuller's analysis, this completed the Clausewitzian triangle, where the edge between the state and the people became fully weighted against the others, unlocking a new, more passionate form of warfare witnessed in World War II.

Fuller argues that when these modern mass societies engage in warfare against one another, the conflict inevitably transcends traditional military or political objectives. The enemy becomes not merely an opposing army or government but a mirror image of one's own society—a totality that must be confronted in its entirety.

This mirroring effect, in Fuller's view, transforms the nature of conflict itself. Victory can no longer be achieved through limited military success or diplomatic compromise. Instead, warfare becomes an existential struggle between competing social orders, demanding nothing less than the complete transformation of the enemy society. The goal shifts from achieving specific political objectives to pursuing total victory through the comprehensive defeat and reconstruction of the opposing nation. Fuller might have pointed to how this manifested in the race-based conquering and exterminating of the Nazis, the mass rape and scorched earth tactics of Soviet expansion, and the area bombing campaigns of the United States and Britain. Fuller argues that the applicability of this framework to the Nazi and Soviet regimes is obvious, but he extends it to the United States as well.

At Casablanca, the Combined Chiefs of Staff defined victory as the "progressive destruction and dislocation of the German Military, industrial, and economic system, and the undermining of the morale of the German people." [^30] The RAF's Combined Bomber Offensive was explicitly "designed to so destroy German material facilities as to undermine the willingness and ability of the German worker to continue the war," as if the German worker was some monolithic entity to be slain.[^31]

Most telling was the British Chiefs of Staff's casual reference to bombing as a means to "inflict direct damage on Germany and Germans."[^32] This deliberate distinction between state and people crystallizes how, in the warfare between modern mass societies that Fuller described, conflict had evolved to target not just military forces or industrial capacity, but the entire fabric of enemy society. The careful balance of Clausewitz's trinity had given way to a totalizing view that saw these elements as a single, indivisible target for destruction.

When German General Hans-Jürgen von Arnim was captured in Tunisia, General Eisenhower's staff suggested following the traditional military custom of receiving the defeated commander—a practice reflective of the more gentlemanly form of monarchical warfare:

> The custom had its origin in the fact that mercenary soldiers of old had no real enmity toward their opponents. Both sides fought for the love of a fight, out of a sense of duty or, more probably, for money. A captured commander of the eighteenth century was likely to be, for weeks or months, the honored guest of his captor. The tradition that all professional soldiers are really comrades in arms has, in tattered form, persisted to this day.[^33]

But Eisenhower forcefully rejected this tradition.

> For me World War II was far too personal a thing to entertain such feelings. Daily as it progressed there grew within me the conviction that as never before in a war between many nations the forces that stood for human good and men's rights were this time confronted by a completely evil conspiracy with which no compromise could be tolerated.

Most tellingly, Eisenhower frames the conflict in explicitly religious terms:

> Because only by the utter destruction of the Axis was a decent world possible, the war became for me a crusade in the traditional sense of that often misused word.

Fuller might have pointed to how one of America's most senior military commanders rejected the traditional professional courtesies of his station, instead treating the enemy as an absolute moral evil. This illustrates how, in Fuller's framework, the general will had transformed even career officers from dispassionate professionals into crusaders against evil.

Fuller would likely argue that this shift did not originate within the military establishment but was deeply rooted in and enthusiastically embraced by the American public. Herbert Hyman's wartime polling data illustrates a populace that not only accepted the concept of total war but actively demanded it. By January 1944, an overwhelming 81% of Americans insisted upon Germany's unconditional surrender, with only one in ten respondents willing to consider any alternative.[^34] Significantly, rather than displaying signs of war fatigue, the American public demonstrated a remarkable willingness to endure further sacrifices. In August 1942, 70% of respondents believed that the population had not yet been asked to make sufficient sacrifices for the war effort. Even by April 1944, after prolonged periods of rationing and mobilization, 58% continued to hold the view that additional sacrifices were necessary.[^35] These attitudes were not formed independently by the public alone; undoubtedly, government messaging, media narratives, and wartime propaganda played influential roles. However, attributing this phenomenon exclusively to either state influence or popular sentiment oversimplifies the issue. Rather, Fuller might suggest it was the reciprocal and reinforcing relationship between the state and its citizens that served as the fundamental driving force behind the emergence and persistence of total war.

Based on Fuller's theoretical framework, one might expect the United States' approach to warfare to be overtly destructive rather than precise—to not just acquiesce to area bombing but to actively encourage it—as the emotionality of the populace-state relationship continued to influence the outcome of the war. Others have arrived at similar conclusions through different theoretical paths. Moralists attribute this destructiveness to industrialization or a hawkish military cadre, while operational Realists argue that area bombing became a tactical necessity. We find all these theories to be insufficient and mostly inaccurate, as we will explore in the subsequent chapters.

Avez-vous prévu jusqu'où les mouvements passionnés, jusqu'où l'exaltation du courage et d'une fausse dignité pourroient porter et justifier l'imprudence...?
