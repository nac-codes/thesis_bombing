## Research plan

This research will proceed along four complementary tracks, combining empirical analysis, theoretical modeling, computational linguistics, and sociological theory to examine the strategic bombing campaign of World War II.

### 1. Analysis of USSBS Attack Data

The first component involves a detailed analysis of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) attack data, which I have digitized into a comprehensive dataset. This data includes:
- Complete record of RAF and USAAF bombing missions
- Target coordinates and categories
- Detailed ordnance information (bomb types, fuzing, and tonnage)
- Temporal distribution of attacks

The analysis will focus particularly on:
a) Classification of attacks into precision, area, and tactical bombing categories based on:
   - Ordnance selection (high explosive vs. incendiary)
   - Fuze settings
   - Target type
   - Formation patterns
b) Quantitative analysis of:
   - Relative proportion of precision vs. area bombing over time
   - Geographic distribution of attack types
   - Correlation between target type and ordnance selection
   - Persistence of precision bombing techniques through 1945

This empirical analysis will challenge the conventional narrative of a wholesale shift to area bombing, demonstrating instead a continued commitment to precision bombing throughout the war.[^18]

### 2. Economic Network Model

The second track involves developing a model in python to provide theoretical validation of precision bombing's superior effectiveness. It will consist of:
a) A network representation of an industrial economy where:
   - Nodes represent factories, power plants, and transportation hubs
   - Edges represent resource flows and dependencies
   - Workers are distributed across nodes
b) Impact analysis of different bombing strategies:
   - Precision bombing (targeted node removal)
   - Area bombing (distributed worker reduction)
   - Mixed strategies
c) Measurement of:
   - Production capacity over time
   - Network resilience
   - Recovery patterns
   - Resource allocation efficiency

The simulation will incorporate historical parameters from the German war economy to ensure relevance to the actual strategic bombing campaign.

### 3. Public Opinion Analysis

The third component employs computational linguistics to analyze public discourse around strategic bombing. The research will examine:
a) A corpus of over 10,000 newspaper articles (1941-1946) containing "strategic bombing" and related terms
b) Semantic analysis using:
   - Vector embeddings of relevant passages
   - Comparison with precision/area bombing concept vectors
   - Temporal trend analysis
c) Measurement of:
   - Evolution of bombing-related terminology
   - Shift in moral framing
   - Changes in technical vs. emotional content
   - Geographic and political variations in coverage

This analysis will quantify the public's growing enthusiasm for area bombing and its potential influence on military strategy.

### 4. Analysis of USSBS Reports and Interrogations

The fourth track incorporates qualitative analysis of digitized USSBS reports and interrogation transcripts to provide detailed insight into the relative effectiveness of precision versus area bombing strategies. This analysis will examine:

a) Industry-specific USSBS reports including:
   - Oil and chemical production
   - Aircraft and armaments manufacturing
   - Transportation systems
   - Utilities

b) Key interrogation transcripts, including:
   - Albert Speer's detailed accounts of industrial adaptation
   - Factory managers' descriptions of production disruption
   - Military leaders' assessments of strategic impact
   - Economic planners' discussions of resource allocation

This documentary analysis will complement the quantitative attack data by providing detailed ground-truth assessment of bombing impacts, as well as the informed perspectives of key leaders of the Nazi war economy. Of particular value are Speer's candid post-war assessments of which attacks proved most devastating to German war production.

### 5. Theoretical Framework

The final track involves applying relevant sociological and economic theories to interpret the empirical findings, particularly:
a) Hans-Hermann Hoppe's analysis of:
   - Democratic warfare
   - State monopoly on violence
   - Total war dynamics
b) Ludwig von Mises's theories on:
   - Interventionism
   - War economics
   - Bureaucratic management
c) William Aylott Orton's work on:
   - Liberal democracy
   - Total war transformation
   - Civilian mobilization
d) Jason P. Lowery's conception of:
   - Power Projection Networks
   - Population-scale hallucinations
   - Abstraction

This theoretical framework will help explain why, despite precision bombing's superior effectiveness, area bombing remained prevalent.

[^18]: Each mission record contains 27 distinct data fields, including target coordinates, bomb types, fuzing details, sighting assessment, and number of sorties. This granular data allows for sophisticated statistical analysis of bombing patterns and effectiveness.
