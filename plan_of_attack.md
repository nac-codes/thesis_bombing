# Plan of Attack

## Overview

This thesis examines the strategic bombing campaign of World War II through empirical analysis of bombing patterns, economic impacts, and a comparative study of economic mobilization. By combining newly digitized raid-by-raid data with economic analysis, we challenge conventional narratives about both the nature of the bombing campaign and its relationship to wartime economic mobilization.

## Introduction (500 words)

The introduction establishes the scope of our investigation, focusing on three key aspects:
- The need for granular analysis of bombing patterns
- The economic effectiveness of different bombing strategies
- The relationship between perceived and actual economic mobilization

## Literature Review (3000 words)

The literature review will be a comprehensive review of the existing literature on the following topics:
- Evolution of strategic bombing from precision to area bombing
- The economic impact of strategic bombing
- The relationship between perceived and actual economic mobilization

## Chapter 1: Bombing by the Numbers (4000 words)

Using a newly compiled comprehensive raid-by-raid dataset of the European theater, we analyze the patterns and evolution of the strategic bombing campaign.

Key points:
- Present new methodology for categorizing bombing missions based on tactical implementation rather than stated intent
- Analyze the physical effects of precision versus area bombing
- Demonstrate the persistence of area bombing alongside precision bombing
- Highlight the increase in area bombing within the transportation sector
- Show how the RAF consistently employed area bombing throughout the war
- Challenge conventional narratives about the shift from precision to area bombing

## Chapter 2: Economic Impact of Strategic Bombing (5000 words)

Drawing extensively on the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) reports, particularly J.K. Galbraith's analysis, we evaluate the economic effectiveness of different bombing strategies.

Key points:
- Compare the economic impacts of precision versus area bombing
- Analyze Galbraith's assessment of German economic mobilization
- Contrast USSBS findings (J.K. Galbraith's Report) with Tooze's analysis in *The Wages of Destruction*
- Evaluate target selection and its relationship to actual economic bottlenecks
- Question the economic rationale behind area bombing and even precision bombing
- Question why these ineffective strategies persisted anyway

## Chapter 3: Mobilization, Perception, and Strategic Bombing (3500 words)

This chapter examines how American perceptions of German mobilization influenced U.S. economic policies and strategic choices.

Key points:
- Compare actual levels of economic mobilization between Germany and the United States
- Analyze the perceptions of German mobilization through analyzing the corpus of US newspapers
- Examine how these perceptions enabled more interventionist economic policies
- Explore strategic bombing as a particularly capital-intensive form of warfare
- Demonstrate how Federal Reserve policies and taxation enabled this capital-intensive strategy
- Question the logic of employing such resource-intensive tactics against a less-mobilized enemy
- Consider how misperceptions about enemy capabilities can drive domestic policy changes

## Conclusion (500 words)

The conclusion synthesizes our findings about the relationship between bombing strategies, economic realities, and wartime mobilization.

Key points:
- Connect empirical findings about bombing effectiveness with economic analysis
- Highlight the role of perception in driving both strategic choices and economic policies
- Consider how misperceptions about enemy capabilities can lead to domestic transformation
- Reflect on the implications for understanding both World War II and modern military strategy
