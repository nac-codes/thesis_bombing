Work Plan for Thesis Completion

Dear Professor Connelly,

I want to address the scope and methodology of my thesis, as well as outline my completion timeline. While I've received feedback suggesting that Chapter 1 lacks a "human element" and reads too scientifically, I believe this approach is essential to my thesis's contribution. The work follows a deliberate three-part structure:

1. Empirical analysis of what the bombing campaign actually entailed
2. Evaluation of strategy effectiveness given German economic conditions
3. Examination of why ineffective strategies persisted

This structure is intentional - we cannot meaningfully discuss why certain strategies were chosen without first establishing what those strategies were and proving their ineffectiveness. My thesis aims to contribute new knowledge through systematic analysis rather than retell the entire narrative of strategic bombing. Not only this, but to tell the whole story properly would require a whole new dataset/corpus and much larger word count.

Assuming my trajectory remains the same, here is the proposed timeline:

December 2023
- Review and incorporate your and peer feedback on current draft
- Begin revising literature review to reflect narrowed scope

January 2024
- Complete literature review revision (Early January)
- Write Chapter 2 on economic impacts (By end of January)
- Begin data analysis for Chapter 3

February 2024
- Complete Chapter 3 on mobilization comparison (First two weeks)
- Revise and edit full draft
- Submit to second reader (Late February)

March 2024
- Incorporate reader feedback
- Final revisions and formatting

I would particularly appreciate your guidance on:
1. Whether this methodological approach is appropriate for a thesis
2. If the scientific/analytical tone of Chapter 1 should be maintained or whether I can, as some of my peers have suggested, "put it all in a footnote"
3. How much should I prioritize readability over contributions to the historical knowledge base? Is it currently unreadable or just dry? 

The thesis is on track to maintain its current word count target of 13,000-17,000 words.

Looking forward to your feedback,
Nick Chimicles
