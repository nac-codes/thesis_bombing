# Preface

*This thesis is designed to be read digitally. Throughout the text, citations are hyperlinked to their source documents, allowing the reader to access and verify the original material with a single click. The data visualizations in Chapter 1 particularly benefit from digital viewing, where zooming capabilities reveal nuanced patterns that may be lost in print. The reader is encouraged to visit the [accompanying website](https://strategic-bombing-data.streamlit.app/) for additional data exploration features.*

*For transparency and accountability, the entire research project has been archived on GitHub at [https://github.com/nac-codes/thesis_bombing](https://github.com/nac-codes/thesis_bombing), documenting the evolution of the argument through all previous versions. This repository also contains all scripts and methodological tools referenced in the appendices, making the research fully reproducible.*

*All materials used in this thesis are stored in an s3 bucket, the index for which can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nac-codes/thesis_bombing/refs/heads/master/s3_bucket_index.md).*

*Should the reader choose to print this document, color printing is strongly recommended to preserve the distinctions between categories in the data visualizations.*
