# Preface

This writing sample represents the literature review and first chapter of my senior thesis examining strategic bombing in World War II through computational and theoretical methods. The complete thesis, which I am currently developing, will include several additional major components:

- A theoretical network model simulating the German wartime economy to analyze the relative effectiveness of precision versus area bombing strategies
- Computational analysis of public discourse using a corpus of over 10,000 contemporary newspaper articles
- Analysis of digitized USSBS interrogation transcripts, including Albert Speer's detailed accounts of industrial adaptation to bombing
- Theoretical framework incorporating perspectives from military history, sociology, and economics

This is a digitally native project - all citations contain direct links to the referenced passages, methodologies, results, and underlying datasets. If you are reading a version where the links have been stripped or a print version, I encourage you to either:
- Read the digital PDF at: [github.com/nac-codes/thesis_bombing/blob/master/thesis.pdf](https://github.com/nac-codes/thesis_bombing/blob/master/thesis.pdf)
- View the complete project and markdown version at: [github.com/nac-codes/thesis_bombing](https://github.com/nac-codes/thesis_bombing)

The full thesis aims to challenge conventional narratives about strategic bombing through a novel combination of traditional historical methods and modern computational techniques. This sample demonstrates my approach to integrating quantitative and qualitative analysis while maintaining rigorous scholarly standards.
