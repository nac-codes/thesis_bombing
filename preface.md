# Preface

*This thesis is designed to be read digitally. Throughout the text, citations are hyperlinked to their source documents, allowing the reader to access and verify the original material with a single click. The data visualizations in Chapter 1 particularly benefit from digital viewing, where zooming capabilities reveal nuanced patterns that may be lost in print. The reader is encouraged to visit the [accompanying website](https://strategic-bombing-data.streamlit.app/) for additional data exploration features.*

*Additionally, this project represents a collaborative partnership between human scholarship and artificial intelligence. AI tools were integral to every phase of this projectâ€”from enhancing my research capabilities, to writing substantial portions of the data processing code, assisting with OCR conversion of archival documents, and serving as a critical thinking partner during drafting and revision. AI functioned as an indispensable research assistant, enabling me to process and analyze volumes of historical data that would have been impossible for an individual researcher to manage within the given timeframe a few years ago. Rather than diminishing the scholarly contribution, this human-AI collaboration exemplifies how emerging computational tools can extend our analytical capabilities while preserving the essential human elements of historical judgment and critical interpretation.*

*For transparency and accountability, the entire research project has been archived on GitHub at [https://github.com/nac-codes/thesis_bombing](https://github.com/nac-codes/thesis_bombing), documenting the evolution of the argument through all previous versions. This repository also contains all scripts and methodological tools referenced in the appendices, making the research fully reproducible.*

*All materials used in this thesis are stored in an s3 bucket, the index for which can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nac-codes/thesis_bombing/refs/heads/master/s3_bucket_index.md).*

*Should the reader choose to print this document, color printing is strongly recommended to preserve the distinctions between categories in the data visualizations.*
