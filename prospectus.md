The state of knowledge on strategic bombing, specifically in terms of its effectiveness and the shift from precision to area bombing over the course of World War II, is divided into two main camps: Realists and Moralists. Realists acknowledge the initial theory of precision bombing but argue that operational realities necessitated a shift to area bombing, viewing it as a rational extension of warfare that ultimately contributed to ending the conflict. Moralists, on the other hand, contend that precision bombing was a disingenuous public relations strategy, and that area bombing was always the intended approach, raising significant moral questions about the targeting of civilians. We summarize these two perspectives below. 

First, in order to avoid confusion, it is neccesary to define strategic bombing, precision bombing, and area bombing. 
1. Precision bombing refers to the targeting of specific nodes in the enemy's economic network, such as factories, transportation hubs, and military installations. The goal was to neutralize the enemy's war-making capacity by destroying these key nodes.
2. Area bombing, on the other hand, refers to the bombing of a large area, typically a city or industrial area, with the aim of destroying it, its infrastructure, and portions of its workforce. The goal was to disrupt economic production and weaken the morale of the civilian population.
3. Strategic bombing refers to the overall campaign, which may include preciscion bombing, area bombing or both, depending on what is deemed most essential to the overall objective.
