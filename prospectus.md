# Bombs and Democratic Fury: A Computational and Sociological Analysis of the American World War II Strategic Bombing Campaign

## Abstract
There are currently two competing narratives on the the shift of strategic bombing from precision to area bombing over the course of the Second World War. One presents it as a natural development from the naivete of precision, or "pinpoint," bombing to a more realistic and battle-tested approach of more generalized area bombing. This we call the "Realist" narrative. The other presents the shift to area bombing as the inevitable result of bellicose military leaders who were willing to do anything to accomplish their objectives and sees precision bombing as a mere public relations front to cover up the true intentions of the bombing campaign. This we call the "Moralist" narrative.

This thesis will attempt to both discredit and synthesize these two narratives. After a brief overview of the literature from both perspectives, we will begin with an analysis of the effectiveness of precision bombing *vis a vis* area bombing. We will utilize raw attack data from the US Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) to display the persistance of precision bombing late into the war, diminishing the narrative of a blanket shift to area bombing. Reports from the US Strategic Bombing Survey will substantiate the claim that these late-war precision attacks were the decisive factor in Allied military victory while area bombing had fairly little effect. We will then back up this *post facto* analysis with the presentation of an *a priori* theory for the effectiveness of precision bombing and the relative ineffectiveness of area bombing.

Knowing the effectiveness of precision bombing over area bombing, we will then question why the Allies persisted in applying area bombing as much as they did late into the war and raise doubts as to whether the true objective of the Allied bombing campaign was to weaken the German war-making capacity while minimizing civilian casualties. To this question we will then apply a theory of the state and war-making as presented by the likes of Hans-Herrmann Hoppe that describe the sociological process by which the modern state shifted towards a form of total war that was not just economic in nature but sought to eliminate every vertex of the enemy's Clausewitzian triangle: its popular passion, its political will, and its military leadership. We argue that the driving force behind the wanton destructiveness of the Allied area bombings was not the military cadre alone or even primarily, but instead was the natural result of the left edge of Clausewitz's triangle—popular passion and governmental will—becoming both overzealous in its ability to destroy and impatient for an end to the war. Destruction—of the enemy materiel, its political entities, its infrastructure, and even its population—became the means by which the Allies sought to achieve swift and total victory. 

This thesis is not unique in its criticism of area bombing, nor in its identification of the populace as a driving force behind the more destructive elements of the Allied bombing campaign. Where it differentiates itself is in simultaneously claiming that precision bombing was effective while area bombing was not. Additionally, the author believes it is the first to attribute the shift from precision to area bombing to a sociological phenomenon that we call "democratic fury." Such a revelation negates the assumption that democracies (or otherwise nations where the populace is involved and identifies with affairs of state) are more ethical in warfare. It argues that the wanton destructiveness of total war is, rather than something that is checked by the populace, is instead the result of the dynamics of popular-rule.

## Review of the Literature
First, in order to avoid confusion, it is necessary to define strategic bombing, precision bombing, and area bombing. 
1. Precision bombing refers to the targeting of specific nodes in the enemy's economic network, such as factories, transportation hubs, and oil refineries. The goal of this strategy is to neutralize the enemy's war-making capacity by destroying these key nodes.
2. Area bombing, on the other hand, refers to the bombing of a large area, typically a city or industrial area, with the aim of destroying it, its infrastructure, and portions of its workforce. The goal of this strategy is to disrupt economic production and weaken the morale of the civilian population.
3. Strategic bombing refers to the overall campaign, which may include precision bombing, area bombing or both.

As stated previously, we have divided the literature into two categories: the "Realist" and the "Moralist." These categories are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive. No one author fits neatly into one category or the other. They are meant merely to provide a framework for comprehension of both reader and author. 

We begin with the Realist perspective. The main argument of the Realist perspective is that the theory of precision, otherwise known as "pinpoint," bombing, developed at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama over the decade preceding WWII, was not applicable under real-world wartime conditions. The pre-war theorists, so the idea goes, had approached strategic bombing too simplistically, viewing it merely as a targeting problem while failing to account for the complex military intelligence network required or the various frictions of war such as weather, maintenance, training, ordinance, and aircraft capabilities. As [Griffith 1994](./corpora/griffith_hansell/chunks/griffith_hansell_0031.txt) notes, "Only operational experience in combat would reveal many of the problems strategic bombers would face. Once World War II had begun the strategic air war took on a dynamic driven by existing technology and actual combat conditions, not by a preconceived air war doctrine." The reality of warfare meant that "technology and friction became the masters, not the servant of strategic bombing practices," leading to a significant departure from pre-war theoretical frameworks.

The technical and operational challenges of precision bombing proved to be far more daunting than pre-war theorists had anticipated. As [McFarland (1995)](./corpora/mcfarland_pursuit/chunks/mcfarland_pursuit_0001.txt) reveals, even with sophisticated equipment like the Norden bombsight, accuracy remained elusive: "one study in 1944 concluded that only 7 percent of all American bombs fell within 1,000 feet of their aiming point." Others like [Beagle (2001)](./corpora/beagle_pointblank/chunks/beagle_pointblank_0007.txt) cite a more generous study, noting that "over the duration of the Second World War, only about 20 percent of the bombs aimed at targets designated for precision attack fell within 1,000 feet of their aim point."[^1]

The unescorted bomber doctrine proved particularly costly. [Builder (1994)](./corpora/builder_icarus/chunks/builder_icarus_0107.txt) explains that "The invincibility of the unescorted bomber formation was an article of faith; Flying Fortress was no idle choice of name for the B-17." This faith would be shattered by reality - as demonstrated by the devastating Schweinfurt and Regensburg raids of 1943, which saw loss rates as high as 20½ percent. Beyond the technical challenges of accuracy and survivability, [Kennett (1982)](./corpora/kennett_history/chunks/kennett_history_0128.txt) emphasizes that "precision bombing would almost certainly be daylight bombing, which meant that the bomber would need speed, armament, or both for its own defense," which created an almost impossible operational challenge for both the engineering of the bombers and crews that flew them.[^2]

The sheer scale required for "precision" attacks further undermined their practicality. According to [Beagle (2001)](./corpora/beagle_pointblank/chunks/beagle_pointblank_0007.txt), even after achieving air superiority in 1944, a precision bombing mission against a single target required approximately 1,000 aircraft. Moreover, "the minimum bomb pattern bombers could deliver was typically larger than the area of the industrial plant being targeted," making precise targeting of specific components within facilities essentially impossible. These limitations meant that bombing campaigns against specific target sets like ball bearing production, aircraft manufacturing, or transportation infrastructure required months of sustained operations, allowing other target sets time to recover and demonstrating the resilience of the German war economy.

- [Crane 2016](./corpora/crane_bombs/chunks/crane_bombs_0147.txt): Crane emphasizes that while American airpower had confidence in the Norden bombsight, the anticipated precision was hard to achieve, with only about 14% of bombs landing within 1,000 feet of their targets during early 1943.
- [McFarland 1995](./corpora/mcfarland_pursuit/chunks/mcfarland_pursuit_0251.txt): McFarland discusses the challenges that altitude and large bombing formations posed to accuracy, noting that bomb patterns became increasingly imprecise as formation size and altitude increased.
- [Parks 1945](./corpora/parks_preciscion/chunks/parks_preciscion_0005.txt): Parks describes how 'bombing on leader' formations, adopted for practical reasons, led to larger bombing patterns and a lower level of accuracy than originally anticipated for precision bombing.

- [Biddle 2002](./corpora/biddle_rhetoric/chunks/biddle_rhetoric_0272.txt): Biddle examines how American planners believed in the viability of the "self-defending" bomber, relying on speed, altitude, and armament for unescorted penetration. This view persisted despite underlying doubts and logistical challenges, until wartime experience revealed its flaws.
- [Werrell 2009](./corpora/werrell_death/chunks/werrell_death_0062.txt): Werrell discusses how American bomber advocates underestimated the need for escorts, firmly believing in the superiority of bombers in mutual defense formations, and failing to predict advancements in defensive technology, such as radar.
- [Hecks 1990](./corpora/hecks_bombing/chunks/hecks_bombing_0126.txt): Hecks details the early struggles with the B-17, noting that inadequate armament and harsh European weather conditions led to high losses, showing that unescorted bombers faced significant operational challenges.
