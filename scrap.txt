This evolution is often presented as inevitable—the natural result of total war's brutal logic. As Garrett (1993) argues, this shift reflected "the tendency in war, and particularly in total war, of military operations escalating to the use of all conceivable means."

American-British Strategy in 1943

"While the enemy's attention is focussed on Russia, the Allies have the initiative in strategic bombing which is the chief method by which they can at present inflict direct damage on Germany and Germans. We must therefore exploit it to the full."

Key here is they talk about: Germany AND Germans

Plan for Combined Bomber Offensive From the United Kingdom
The combined efforts of the entire U. S. and British bomber forces can produce the results required to achieve the mission prescribed for this theater. Fortunately the capabilities of the two forces are entirely complementary.
The tremendous and ever increasing striking power of the R.A.F. bombing is designed to so destroy German material facilities as to undermine the willingness and ability of the German worker to continue the war. Because of this, there is great flexibility in the ability of the R.A.F. to direct its material destruction against those objectives which are closely related to the U. S. bombing effort which is directed toward the destruction of specific essential industrial targets. It is considered that the most effective results from strategic bombing will be obtained by directing the combined day and night effort of the U. S. and British bomber forces to all-out attacks against targets which are mutually complementary in undermining a limited number of selected objective systems. All-out attacks imply precision bombing of related targets by day and night where tactical conditions permit, and area bombing by night against the cities associated with these targets. The timing of the related day and night attacks will be determined by tactical considerations.

The key language here is targeting the German worker.

You kind of get to the question of who is your enemy... the german worker? the german solider? german people? just hitler? just the nazi regime? ... the answer is that it is all of these things at once.

Attrition of Germany
12. Apart from operations to clear the enemy out of North Africa, our attrition of Germany has hitherto comprised bombing, blockade, raids and subversive action. All these methods strike at the enemy's industrial and economic system, submarine construction, sources of air power and, last but not least, at the morale of the German people--and all can be intensified.

From Lyn Alden Broken Money:

During World War II, governments around the world once again printed
vast sums of new money to drain their citizens' savings and finance
their war efforts, which led to major currency devaluations and
persistent price inflation. And governments once again enacted price and
wage controls to try to curtail the inflation that they themselves
caused with their money-printing. They also enacted various policies to
direct private sector production toward the war
effort.

During World War II, the U.S. dollar experienced significant monetary expansion, with the **money supply roughly doubling** between 1941 and 1945. This surge was driven by Federal Reserve policies that financed wartime deficits through large-scale government bond purchases, effectively creating new money. By 1946, the monetary base had grown from $20 billion to $40 billion, while M2 money supply expanded from $56 billion to $127 billion[7][9][18]. This expansion laid the groundwork for post-war inflation, though price controls and rationing suppressed immediate inflationary effects during the conflict[7][19].

### Key Monetary Developments:
1. **Federal Reserve Policies**:  
   The Fed implemented yield curve control, pegging short-term rates near 0.375% and long-term rates at 2.5%, while monetizing $22 billion in government debt[7][9]. This facilitated deficit spending that reached **30% of GDP annually** during the war[7][16].  
2. **Gold Inflows**:  
   Allied nations paid for U.S. supplies with gold reserves, boosting the U.S. gold stock from $20 billion to $24 billion by 1945[8][12].  
3. **Post-War Inflation**:  
   After price controls lifted in 1946, pent-up demand caused inflation to spike to **20%**, eroding the dollar’s purchasing power[7][21].

### Perspectives from Economists:
- **Ludwig von Mises** analyzed wartime monetary policies, warning that inflationary finance would lead to post-war currency instability. He criticized the disconnect between money creation and economic output, arguing that artificial credit expansion distorts prices and risks hyperinflation[4][10][34].  
- **Hyman Minsky’s** work on financial instability is less directly tied to WWII monetary dynamics, though his later theories on debt-driven cycles align with critiques of wartime deficit financing[33][34].

### Post-War Consequences:
The Bretton Woods system (1944) temporarily stabilized the dollar by pegging it to gold at $35/oz, but the wartime money supply growth set the stage for long-term inflationary pressures that culminated in the dollar’s devaluation in 1971[8][13][35]. Mises’ warnings about fiat currency fragility proved prescient as the U.S. abandoned gold convertibility entirely[34][38].  

In summary, WWII’s monetary expansion reduced the dollar’s purchasing power by enabling post-war inflation, a process Mises linked to the dangers of unanchored fiat systems[7][34][40].

As a result, from the beginning of the democratic–republican age—initially under a pseudo gold standard and at an accelerated pace since 1971 under a government paper money standard—a seemingly permanent secular tendency toward inflation and currency depreciation has existed. During the monarchical age with commodity money largely outside of government control, the “level” of prices had generally fallen and the purchasing power of money increased, except during times of war or new gold discoveries. Various price indices for Britain, for instance, indicate that prices were substantially lower in 1760 than they had been hundred years earlier; and in 1860 they were lower than they had been in 1760.20 Connected by an international gold standard, the development in other countries was similar.21 In sharp contrast, during the democratic–republican age, with the world financial center shifted from Britain to the U.S. and the latter in the role of international monetary trend setter, a very different pattern emerged. Before World War I, the U.S. index of wholesale commodity prices had fallen from 125 shortly after the end of the War between the States, in 1868, to below 80 in 1914. It was then lower than it had been in 1800.22 In contrast, shortly after World War I, in 1921, the U.S. wholesale commodity price index stood at 113. After World War II, in 1948, it had risen to 185. In 1971 it was 255, by 1981 it reached 658, and in 1991 it was near 1,000. During only two decades of irredeemable fiat money, the consumer price index in the U.S. rose from 40 in 1971 to 136 in 1991, in the United Kingdom it climbed from 24 to 157, in France from 30 to 137, and in Germany from 56 to 116.23

PRELIMINARY REPORT
WORKING
COMMITTEE
DENAZIFICATION POLICY BOARD
20 December 1945
The primary objective of the occupation of Germany is to
assure that Germany never again will threaten her neighbors or the peace of the world.
We have already taken the obvious initial steps
in that direction;
disarmament and demilitarization. But a larger
and more difficult task remains - that of eliminating the fundamental conditions in German life which have made her a recurring menace to
the peace of the world.
The best assurance of peace, so far as Germany is concerned,
lies in the creation of a free, democratic society in which political and economic power rests upon a broad popular base undominated by fascist or militaristic elements. To achieve this, not only must the basic social attitudes of the German people be changed but also political and economic power must be shifted from the ruling groups in
German society during the Nazi regime to other groups in whom we may
justifiably have greater confidence.

Note: The way you treat your enemy once you've won is reflective of how you conceived of them during wartime. So this endgoal of denazification is reflective of that sort of war on not just a military force, a political force, or an economic force, but literally changing the way people think.

(Excerpts from)
4. Basic Objectives of Military Government in Germany:
a. It should be brought home to the Germans that Germany's ruthless warfare and the fanatical Nazi resistance have destroyed the German economy and made chaos and suffering inevitable and that the Germans cannot escape responsibility for what they have brought upon themselves.

b. Germany will not be occupied for the purpose of liberation but as a defeated enemy nation. Your aim is not oppression but to occupy Germany for the purpose of realizing certain important Allied objectives. In the conduct of your occupation and administration you should be just but firm and aloof. You will strongly discourage fraternization with the German officials and population.

c. The principal Allied objective is to prevent Germany from ever again becoming a threat to the peace of the world. Essential steps in the accomplishment of this objective are the elimination of Nazism and militarism in all their forms, the immediate apprehension of war criminals for punishment, the industrial disarmament and demilitarization of Germany, with continuing control over Germany's capacity to make war, and the preparation for an eventual reconstruction of German political life on a democratic basis.

d. Other Allied objectives are to enforce the program of reparations and restitution, to provide relief for the benefit of countries devastated by Nazi aggression, and to ensure that prisoners of war and displaced persons of the United Nations are cared for and repatriated.

"Made chaos and suffering inevitable and that the Germans cannot escape responsibility for what they have brought upon themselves." - this is a pretty wild quote...has the average german really done this to themselves?

From Martyr Made
In his haunting book, Human Smoke,
 author Nicholson Baker writes about a memo distributed by the British Air Staff on March 6, 1941, titled Chemical Board Crop Subcommittee, First Report. Quote, It discussed the possibility of dropping weed seeds, bugs, and plant diseases on Axis crops. Such attacks might have a moral effect on the German population, it was contended.
 Another idea was to kill crops or stunt their growth using substances developed by Imperial Chemical Industries, the English company that made bombs in Runkall brand sprayable mustard gas. ICI's Chemical 1313 acted on wheat and other grains, while Chemical 1414 ravaged root crops. In 1941, their use by aerial distribution over Germany was envisaged, a later memo said,
 end quote. That same day, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met with Air Marshal Charles Portal, Chief of Staff of the Royal
Air Force. Churchill, by this point, knew that the only way Britain had a chance of winning the war was if the Americans could somehow be drawn into it. And to that end,
 he told his cabinet explicitly that he was actively seeking ways to provoke the Germans to drastic action against Britain. Germany by this point was beginning to focus on the East, and not to abandon the war in the West, but it was certainly de-emphasized. And Churchill believed that the propaganda effect on the American public of German
 atrocities against Britain would be a greater gain than whatever was lost to the German attacks. Baker writes, quote, Churchill asked Portal to see if he could try something a little different, using some special weapons. They'd tried it before, back in the summer, just after France fell, but it hadn't worked all that well.
 Maybe they should give it another chance. The weapons to be used weren't bombs, exactly. They were leaflets without words. The British called them calling cards— They were about the size of a playing card, maybe a little smaller, and they were made of a phosphorus wafer held between two layers of moist fabric.
 When the fabric dried out in the sun, the phosphorus caught fire. There were other shapes and configurations. Sometimes they were coated with a plastic substance that cracked when it dried. When it cracked, the wafer burned. What might these fire sandwiches set alight? Grain? They'd tried that already. Churchill's thoughts turned to the Black Forest.
 In fact, why not burn down all the forests of Germany? They began on a Monday night, September 2nd, 1940, but the Air Ministry held back the news for two days. Woods are bombed, was the headline in the New York Times. RAF bombers have unleashed a devastating attack with incendiary bombs on the famous Black Forest, east of Baden,
 the dense woods of the Oberhars Mountains, the forest district of Grunewald on the outskirts of Berlin, and forests in Thuringia, said the paper. Fires were still burning in the Black Forest a day afterward. The pine trees of the Hars Mountains blazed up like tinder. One returning pilot recognized one of the peaks in the Harz Mountains.

 Cooper: " Given its ubiquity throughout human history, it is hard to say that war is unnatural. And if it is natural, then the demands it places upon us must in some way be natural too.But I think it's safe to say that when you've descended to the point of trying to burn down ancient forests, more or less out of spite, that something essential in your humanity has been sacrificed on the bloody altar"



 










/Users/chim/Working/Thesis/Archive/Telford_Taylor_Papers/FOLLY_STRATEGIC_BOMBING/IMG_3944.JPG
Fuller's point about air power is crisply made in the preface:
"... war is no more than a lethal argument, and, to be worth the fighting, it demands a sane and profitable political end." Its "object... is not slaughter and devastation but to persuade the enemy to change his mind"; i.e., to abandon the policies which on his side brought about the war. "Strategic bombing, as inaugurated by Mr. Churchill, was not only morally wrong but militarily wrong and politically suicidal—one has only to look at Central Europe today to see this."




From Human Smoke
[Christopher] Isherwood was hurt by it. "Am I afraid of being bombed? Of course. Everybody is," he wrote in his diary. But that wasn't why he had gone to the United States. "If I fear anything," he said, "I fear the atmosphere of the war, the power which it gives to all the things I hate—the newspapers, the politicians, the puritans, the scoutmasters, the middle-aged merciless spinsters." Isherwood shrank, he said, from the duty of opposition: "I am afraid I should be reduced to a chattering, enraged monkey, screaming back hate at their hate." That's why he'd left. It was January 20, 1940.

"enraged monkey screaming back hate at their hate" - this sums of the atmosphere of the time.


--------------------------------
THE NEW BRITISH WAR CABINET—sixteen men sitting around a big table, with Churchill in the middle—met at eleven o'clock in the morning. It was May 15, 1940. Churchill called for a "very large round-up of enemy aliens and suspect persons." It would be better, he said, if these people were behind barbed wire—safer for them, if the Germans started bombing England and people got angry. The war-cabinet minutes record no mention that the majority of the aliens were Jewish refugees of recent arrival.

There was another important item of business—was it time, Churchill asked, to bomb the German industrial heartland—the Ruhr Valley? He thought it was. The bombing would, he said, "cut Germany at its tap root." This was the "psychological moment to strike Germany in her own country and convince the German people that England had the will and the power to hit them hard." It should begin immediately. There was no need to inform France.

The air marshal, Richard Peirse, said that his staff had been at work choosing suitable German railroad-marshaling yards as targets. (Railroad yards, which are often in the middle of cities, are easier to aim at from the air than specific blacked-out buildings or industrial neighborhoods.) Hugh Dowding, the head of Fighter Command, said that England should not be deterred by fear of return attacks. These were "bound to come sooner or later." Churchill agreed. "We must expect this country to be hit in return," he said.

There was another important consideration, Churchill said: "American sympathy had recently been veering very much in our favor." Would this contemplated bombing of targets located within German cities produce a "revulsion of feeling" in the United States? Or would it be accepted there as justifiable retaliation?

To shore up the case for England's retaliatory bombing of Germany—despite the fact that no English cities had yet been bombed—Churchill asked the new minister of information, Duff Cooper, to "arrange that discreet reference should be made in the press to the killing of civilians in France and the Low Countries, in the course of German air attacks." The press should not actually mention retaliation, however, Churchill thought.

Permanent Under-Secretary Cadogan wrote in his diary: "Cabinet this morning decided to start bombing Ruhr. Now the 'Total War' begins!"


^ Influence of british propaganda on the american public
-----------------------------------------------------



We can mention the black forest episode because it was also reported in the Times ... not exactly celebrated.. but the headline making a pun with "incensed" portrays a certain lack of seriousness. Also are we seriously supposed to believe that this had a strategic objective?


CHURCHILL ASKED PORTAL to see if he could try something a little different, using some special weapons. They'd tried it before, back in the summer, just after France fell, but it hadn't worked all that well. Maybe they should give it another chance.

The weapons to be used weren't bombs exactly; they were leaflets without words. The British called them "calling cards." They were about the size of a playing card—maybe a little smaller—and they were made of a phosphorus wafer held between two layers of moist fabric. When the fabric dried out in the sun, the phosphorus caught fire. There were other shapes and configurations—sometimes they were coated with a plastic substance that cracked when it dried. When it cracked, the wafer burned.

What might these fire sandwiches set alight? Grain? They'd tried that already. Churchill's thoughts turned to the Black Forest. Hitler had storehouses and command headquarters hidden away there. In fact, why not burn down all the forests of Germany?

They began on a Monday night, September 2, 1940, but the Air Ministry held back the news for two days: "Woods Are Bombed" was the headline in The New York Times. "R.A.F. bombers have unleashed a devastating attack with incendiary bombs on the famous Black Forest, east of Baden, the dense woods of the Oberharz Mountains, the forest district of Grunewald, on the outskirts of Berlin, and forests in Thuringia," said the paper.

Fires were still burning in the Black Forest a day afterward. The pine trees of the Harz Mountains "blazed up like tinder." One returning pilot recognized one of the peaks in the Harz Mountains—he'd stayed near there once on a holiday. On this mountain, he remembered, lived a legendary giant. "I was telling the other chaps in my plane about it as we were flying over it," he said. Near the railway line that went up the giant's mountain, bombs started "a nice new little patch of fire about a mile square," the pilot added.

INCENDIARY 'CARDS' A BRITISH WEAPON
Damp Discs, Dropped by R.A.F. by Thousands, Dry and Ignite-Nazis Incensed
By The Assoclated Press.
LONDON, Sept. 10-Britain disclosed tonight a new "secret weap-on" in the form of innocent-looking bits of chemically treated cardboard dropped by the millions on Germany as delayed fire-bombs that burst into flame in unexpected quarters.
Germany, in first making pubiic the new British tactics, acknowledged that the fire-secreting "call-ing cards" carried something more than a mere nuisance threat.
British authorities, in subsequently admitting use of the new weapon, described it only as a "self-igniting leaf," and declined to furnish details.
But the authentic German de-scription, given after chemical analysis, sounded like a sequence from some fertile adventure cartoon or a passage from a detective thriller.
The cards, composed of guncotton and phosphorus, are carried in a moist state, the Germans said.
Scattered over the countryside in lots of a quarter-million from a single plane, they dry out naturally and spring suddenly into flames about eight inches high when warmed by natural processes to a moderate temperature.
