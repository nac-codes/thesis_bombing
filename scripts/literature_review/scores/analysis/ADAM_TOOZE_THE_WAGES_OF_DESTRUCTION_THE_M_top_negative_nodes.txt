Applying the Germans’ own conservative standards, the Holocaust must have claimed the lives of at least 2.4 million potential workers. Adding this to Nazism’s other acts of mass murder after January 1942, we arrive at an astonishing total. Of the 1.65 million inmates of concentration camps employed at one time or another in the German economy—referring here to camps not involved in the extermination phase of the Final Solution— no more than 475,000 survived the war.32 This implies the death of at least 1.1 million workers, at least 800,000 of whom do not also number amongst the victims of the Holocaust. Of the 1.95 million Soviet prisoners of war who are thought to have been employed in Germany after November 1941, less than half survived the war. As many as a million Soviet prisoners may, therefore, have died after they were designated as potential contributors to the German war effort.

Its dying embers flared up only occasionally in the rearguard actions of empire. But with it also went any aspiration to the ‘freedom’ once implied by great power status. As early as the autumn of 1943, after the Battle of Kursk, the United States had realized that the dominant power in Europe for the foreseeable future would be the Soviet Union, not Britain, let alone France. At first Roosevelt’s administration hoped to adjust to this new reality in cooperation with the Soviets. To- gether the two superpowers would rule both Europe and the world, under which circumstances it might have been possible to ‘do without Germany’. But by 1947 that option was clearly off the table. First West Germany and then East Germany were resurrected as independent states. Their subsequent economic recovery along with that of the rest of Europe was one of the true miracles of the twentieth century. The success in creating a democratic polity in West Germany was also remarkable. So free, in fact, did West Germany seem of the tensions that had plagued the Weimar Republic, that some were even tempted to suppose that the curative fire of National Socialism had been necessary to drive out the German demons. What this ignores, however, is that German democracy after 1945 was not as anyone had imagined it in the 1920s. It existed within a strange and truncated form of statehood and much the same might be said for most, if not all, of the former ‘great powers’ of Europe. Through the middle of Germany’s territory ran the new battle lines of the Cold War. Huge forces of occupation were massed on either side, non-European forces-American on one side, Soviet on the other. The threat of nuclear annihilation hung over everyone.

Indeed, the public preoccupation with Speer continues to this day, making him the subject of biographies, television documentaries and stage plays.2 There are two main strands to the mythology of Albert Speer. The first is the suggestion that Speer was ‘unpolitical’. In one version of this myth Speer is presented as an artistic soul, an architect, who was pushed reluctantly to take on wider responsibilities. This was a self-image that Speer shared with Hitler.2 A less romantic rendition casts Speer as an ‘unpolitical technician’, a man given the task of resurrecting the German war effort, who did his job without asking questions about the wider purpose of his work or the wider activities of the regime that he served.

How was Germany’s political leadership to respond to the material aspirations awakened in its population by the example of American affluence? These are undeniably modern questions. Indeed, they are with us still. Hitler’s answers, however, were explosive. The solution was not to ally Germany with the United States, or to adopt American modes of life and production.

Of the 1.95 million to the ‘clearance’ of the Jewish population of the General Government, a population estimated at the Wannsee conference to include no less than 2.28 million people. Here, too, ‘Selektion’ was the first principle of the operation. In the Lublin district, presided over by Odilo Globocnik, the Jewish council was instructed in early 1942 to issue identity cards and to draw up lists of all Jews ‘that do not work productively’.32 According to an entry in Goebbels’s diary in the spring of 1942, the assumption was that ‘60 per cent will have to be liquidated, whereas only 40 per cent can still be employed as labour’.40  The fate initially intended for the group selected for labour seems to have been that outlined by Heydrich at the Wannsee conference. They were to be separated by sex and were to be worked to death on the far-flung building sites of the Generalplan Ost. At least until the autumn of 1942, the Generalplan was very much a live proposition. On 16 July 1942 Himmler visited his masseur and confidant Felix Kersten in an enthusiastic mood. His elation was due to a meeting a few days earlier, at which he had presented Hitler with the final version of the Generalplan, complete with maps and architectural plans for German peasant villages. With his armies roaring towards the Caucasus in the Wehrmacht’s last great summer offensive, Hitler was again convinced that the war in the East would soon be won. As Himmler reported it: ‘The Fuehrer not only listened to me, he even refrained from constant interruptions, as is his usual habit . .. today he went so far as to approve of my In these documents, the SS present themselves as a committed minority forcing the programme of Judaeocide down the throats of an uncomprehending military administra

The Wehrmacht could not claim that it lacked experience in dealing with prisoners of war. On the Western Front it had coped quite adequately with 2 million men taken in the space of only two months. But in advance of the Barbarossa campaign an order was given to exempt Soviet prisoners from the normally accepted standards of the Geneva Convention. Special guidelines were laid down for the isolation and execution of those judged to be politically dangerous. The prisoners were to be separated into distinct ethnic categories. No adequate preparations were made for housing them over the winter months. In so far as any thought was given to the matter, the assumption seems to have been that they would dig mud dugouts. Special rations were prescribed providing far less nutrition than for any other category of prisoner. Even well-managed prisoner-of-war camps are not healthy places. Many Red Army soldiers were in a poor condition when they were captured. Many were wounded or suffering from shock and exhaustion. Many had not eaten for days.

A less romantic rendition casts Speer as an ‘unpolitical technician’, a man given ‘unpolitical Speer’ was solidly founded on the second pillar of the Speer myth, the myth of the so-called ‘armaments miracle’. This refers to the remarkable upsurge in the armaments output apparently presided over by Speer after February 1942, an upsurge that was widely credited with keeping Germany in the war (see Appendix, Table A6). On the assumption that Nazi ideology and technocratic efficiency were mutually exclusive, Speer’s triumphant production record was enough in itself to put distance between him and other less appetizing defendants in the dock at Nuremberg. Speer was simply too intelligent, too good at his job, to be compared to primitive anti-Semites such as Julius Streicher, or self-seeking ogres like Hermann Goering. Yet Speer’s claim to have been an unpolitical actor was always self-evidently absurd. Speer (1905-81) applied to join the Nazi party in early 1931, in the first flush of Hitler’s electoral success, but at atime when the party was still far from the mainstream of German political life. From the first May Day celebration of 1933 onwards, Speer was personally responsible for crafting the dramatic public image of the regime. The annual rallies at Nuremberg, the gigantic harvest festivals of the RNS and the 1936 Olympics were all his creations. Speer built his entire career on his contacts within the Nazi party and above all his close personal relationship with Hitler, a trump card that he played for all it was worth. Speer manoeuvred his way through the office politics of the Third Reich with skill and ruthlessness.4 He was closely allied both with Fritz Todt and, through Erhard Milch, with Goering’s Air Ministry. From the late 1930s onwards he also enjoyed a cooperative working relationship with Heinrich Himmler and the SS.

Already in the aftermath of Stalingrad, Gestapo informants reported an ever greater willingness to resort to the black market.72 As households came to rely ever Much could be made of this unwillingness on the part of the Third Reich to impose the full cost of the war on the Volksgenossen. It could be read as a symptom of the regime’s deep-seated ‘populism’. But the irony, of course, was that the decision not to tax did not imply that the real burdens of the war were not imposed on the German population. Whether or not they were directly appropriated by the state, an increasing share of the wages and social benefits paid out during the war could not be spent, or could only be spent on black-market purchases at exorbitant prices. In this sense, it would be naive to infer from the failure to impose draconian war taxes that the Third Reich was not willing to impose the full cost of the war on its citizens.88 Whatever happened to money incomes, rationing and the restriction in the production of consumer goods, combined with the impact of British and American bombing, were severely reducing the real standard of living of the German population. Choosing not to match this real reduction with equivalent taxes on money incomes was at best ambiguous in its effects. It may have left some people feeling richer on account of the funds accumulating in savings accounts or in war bonds. But these were promises of future purchasing power that depended for their real value on the success of the Reich’s authorities in maintaining the value of the Reichsmark. Meanwhile, the inflationary danger posed by this pent-up purchasing power nece

The methods of Kammler’s Mittelbau were thus extended to the entire Luftwaffe sector.22  This increasingly draconian attitude to labour discipline reached its limit in the drive to mobilize the reserves of concentration camp labour. A fortnight after the establishment of the Jaegerstab Himmler wrote to Milch to inform him that the Luftwaffe was currently employing 36,000 concentration camp inmates in its factories and that he hoped to raise this in the near future to 90,000.21 As an example of a productive collaboration, Himmler cited the case of Messerschmitt’s fighter plant at Regensburg, which had entered into a sub-contracting deal with the Flossenbuerg concentration camp.

Anti-Communism was an unwavering element in his politics, tightly interwoven with a particularly toxic form of conspiratorial anti-Semitism. But anti-Communism was generic on the German right, as were projects of Eastern expansionism. Furthermore, though the Soviet Union remained a looming presence in European affairs, it turned inwards from the late 1920s onwards and in the 1930s tended to be belittled as a factor in European power politics. To identify the peculiarity and motivating dynamic of Hitler’s regime, it therefore seemed more illuminating in the early chapters of this book to focus on the relations between the Third Reich and the Western powers.  The rise of the United States confronted Germany, as it did Britain and France, with a choice. With Stresemann as Foreign Minister, the Weimar Republic responded with remarkable flexibility and realism to the new situation. As we have shown, the Weimar Republic premised its entire security strategy on the economic power of the United States, both as a guarantor of its security and as a lever through which to pressure Britain and France into revision of the Treaty of Versailles. And as we have seen, this strategic choice continued to define the policy of the last respectable government of the Weimar Republic up to the summer of 1932. Not until the final spasm of the Great Depression in 1932-3 and the collapse of American hegemony in Europe was the path really open for Hitler’s brand of aggressively unilateralist nationalism. In one of his final conversations with Martin Bormann, in February 1945, Hitler remarked: ‘An unfortunate historical accident fated it that my seizure of power should coincide with the moment at which the chosen one of world Jewry, Roosevelt, should have taken the helm in the White House . .. Everything is ruined by the Jew, who has settled upon the United States as his most powerful bastion.1 What weighed on Hitler’s mind, in the last months of the

Within weeks, Japan had dealt a shattering blow to the British Empire. For the foreseeable future, the Western powers would be spread across the entire globe. For Hitler, meanwhile, the chief priority continued to be the Soviet Union. As he had done since the summer of 1940, he continued to regard the successful elimination of the Soviet Union as the essential precondition for a global war against Britain and America. Well into the early summer of 1942 Hitler speculated that the blows inflicted by the Japanese, combined with fresh German successes against the Red Army, would be enough to split asunder the unnatural alliance between Britain and America. As events in Asia were demonstrating only too clearly, Britain was in imminent danger of losing its Empire. Only America stood to profit from continuing the struggle. Once the Red Army was knocked out by Germany’s second effort, the British people would surely realize the folly of their government. Churchill would be removed and Britain would throw in its lot with Germany.

The obvious interest of the British in engaging the Americans, the obvious interest of American business in the booming armaments economy, and Roosevelt’s open hostility to Germany were all rational elements in this assessment. But, as we have seen, this was compounded, at least since 1938, by a powerful strain of anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. The idea that Roosevelt was acting as an agent of ‘international Jewry’ in fomenting an all-embracing anti-Nazi coalition had been a staple of Hitler’s thinking at least since the violent American response to Kristallnacht. And it was to his speech of January 1939, with its prophecy of doom, that Hitler returned once more in the latter half of 1941. He made the connection explicitly i

It also reveals the terrifying fears that crowded in upon the leaders of German industry, whenever they paused to contemplate the wider situation of the Third Reich. Robert Ley, as usual, was drunk. And when Ley was drunk he was prone to speaking his mind: ‘The coal must be got, whatever happens. If not with you, gentlemen, then against you.’ If the Ruhr failed, so would the entire armaments effort and in the autumn of Stalingrad that would spell disaster. ‘After us there is nothing, everything will be over . .. Germany will be destroyed. Everybody will be slaughtered, murdered, burned and destroyed. We have, after all, burned all bridges behind us, deliberately, we have. We have practically solved the Jewish question in Germany. That alone is something so awesome.’ With so much at stake there was no room for compassion or civility. No degree of coercion was too much and Ley expected the mine managers to back up their foremen in meting out the necessary discipline. As Ley put it: ‘When a Russian pig has to be beaten’, it would be the ordinary German worker who would have to do it. ‘You won't be doing it and I won't.’ To make sure the mine managers got the message, Pleiger added with characteristic cynicism: ‘Below ground it is dark and Berlin is a long way away.’ Clearly, Ley and Pleiger expected Germany’s coal miners to ignore Sauckel’s sanctimonious injunctions. If Ostarbeiter did not work, they were to be beaten. But if employers did prefer a more formal mode of discipline, Heinrich Himmler’s police could always be counted upon. Pleiger referred enthusiastically to the results achieved by the ‘small but perfectly formed concentration camp’ that he used to discipline his workforce at the Reichswerke.2> At wvanionle: tha aaman ten ne tha Vaiaas

Rearmament came at a serious cost and this was made even more pressing by the often crippling constraints imposed by Germany’s balance of payments. Already in 1934 the interests of both consumer goods industries and farmers were being sacrificed to rearmament. From 1935 in many German cities, butter and meat were surreptitiously rationed. From 1938 onwards, with military spending reaching wartime levels, the trade-off between consumption and armaments became truly severe. That Hitler’s regime was able to impose this redistribution of resources betokens not inefficiency and disorganization, but a system that was highly effective in pursuit of its central objectives. Furthermore, it should lead us to question any interpretation of Hitler’s regime based on the assumption that it lacked solid internal foundations. To reiterate, the Third Reich shifted more resources in peacetime into military uses than any other capitalist regime in history. And this advantage in terms of domestic resource mobilization continued to hold throughout the ensuing world war. bastion.1 What weighed on Hitler’s mind, in the last months of the war, was the pivotal role played by Roosevelt in frustrating his project of Continental conquest. In 1933, however, the role of So far-reaching were the regime’s interventions in the German economy -starting with exchange controls and ending with the rationing of all key raw materials and the forced conscription of civilian workers in peacetime-that one is tempted to make comparisons with Stalin’s Soviet Union. Such a comparison is certainly suggestive in pointing to the kind of synthesis between militarization and domestic social and economic restructuring that might have been necessary to fulfil Hitler’s ambitions. Since the emergence of the United States as a world power in the early twentieth century, only Soviet-style militarism has been able to mount a credible and sustained challenge to its hegemony. And
