A large part of the increase in production up to July 1944 could only be explained in terms of measures taken prior to the formation of the Jaegerstab. Most importantly, the Air Ministry in the course of 1943 had extracted 317,000 workers from Sauckel for the Luftwaffe industries, in addition to 243,000 workers obtained on its own initiative. Amongst this number the Air Ministry claimed ‘credit’ for the extra 100,000 concentration camp inmates supplied by the SS in 1943 and 1944. The Ministry had also set in motion the expansion in aero-engine production, without which the huge surge in aircraft output in 1944 would not have been possible. What rankled most of all, however, was the inconsistent attitude of the Speer Ministry. The essence of Saur’s story was that it was only the ‘lightning-fast response’ of Speer and his staff that had saved the Luftwaffe from immediate disaster in February 1944.31 But this ignored the fact that in the early autumn of 1943, in the immediate aftermath of Hamburg, the Air Ministry had drafted its own plan to bolster Germany’s fighter defences.32 The draft version of the so-called Reichsverteidigungsprogramm (Luftwaffe programme 224) had called for monthly production by July 1944 of no less than 5,390 aircraft, of which two-thirds were to be fighters.

That is absolutely insufficient.’8 In fact, Speer was over-optimistic. The monthly index of armaments showed no consistent increase whatsoever in the second half of 1943. Speer also acknowledged that Germany had fallen behind in terms of the quality of its weapons:  We have lived through times in army equipment when our tanks were inferior to those of the Russians . .. The Luftwaffe in the course of the last two years has quite indubitably suffered from an absolute inferiority, a technical inferiority to the weapons of the enemy.

The hope for the coming months was that Germany would soon be able to match the quality of its enemy’s weapons, thanks to the breakthroughs of its scientists and engineers. What Germany now needed was to compound its technological advances with a renewed surge in the quantity of production. And Speer hammered home his message:  It is not only possible, it is necessary.

The aircraft that were already in production had proved themselves unable to achieve a decisive victory over the Royal Air Force. The Junkers 88 medium bomber was far from being the war-winning universal combat aircraft that had been sold to Goering in 1938. A battlefield report commissioned from squadrons stationed on the Channel coast recorded that the aircrew were ‘not afraid of the enemy, but were afraid of the Junker 88’.52 It was slow, it lacked effective defensive armament and for strategic bombing its payload was hopelessly inadequate. With upgraded engines, both the older-generation medium bombers, the He 111 and the Do 17, proved capable of outperforming the Ju 88, their designated successor. And this was no mere technicality. The Luftwaffe’s entire industrial plan since 1938 had been built around the primacy of the Ju 88, the Junkers corporation and Heinrich Koppenberg, its CEO. To call into question the qualities of the Ju 88 was to call into question the entire basis of Luftwaffe development over the previous three years, as well as hundreds of millions of Reichsmarks of investment.

To explain the extraordinarily robust rebound in aircraft production, he commented: ‘I have to add... that here an alteration in the system has taken place on the quiet, in that from February we have, as we have done in the other industries, brought in capacities from the armour and Panzer industries into the aircraft industry.

The repeated raids on the Ruhr in 1943 had exacted a terrible toll from RAF Bomber Command. Nearly 4,000 crew were killed or taken prisoner, and 640 bombers were shot down or crashed. Terrible as this attrition was, however, thanks to the mounting output of the British aircraft factories, the RAF’s bomber strength actually increased between February and August 1943.48 The Ruhr was the choke point and in 1943 it was within the RAF’s grip. The failure to maintain that hold and to tighten it was a tragic operational error. The ongoing disaster that Speer and his cohorts clearly expected in the summer of 1943 was put off for another year.  With hindsight, therefore, it is clear that the Third Reich was not yet finished. But the impact on contemporaries of the events of July 1943 cannot be exaggerated. Even the most rabid adherents of the Third Reich could hardly deny that the ‘end was nigh’.

Critical stores were to be reserved above all for the main strike force of 33 tank and motorized infantry divisions. If the battle extended much beyond the first months of the attack, the fighting power of the rest of the German army would dwindle rapidly. Fundamentally, the Wehrmacht was a ‘poor army’.82 The fast-striking motorized element of the German army in 1941 consisted of only 33 divisions out of 130. Three-quarters of the German army continued to rely on more traditional means of traction: foot and horse. The German army in 1941 invaded the Soviet Union with somewhere between 600,000 and 750,000 horses.83 The horses were not for riding. They were for moving guns, ammunition and supplies. Weeks prior to the invasion, 15,000 Panje carts were issued to the infantry units that would trail behind the fast-moving Panzers. The vast majority of Germany’s soldiers marched into Russia, as they had into France, on foot. Of course, things would have been better if Germany had had three times as many tanks and trucks. But to imagine a fully motorized Wehrmacht, poised for an attack on the Soviet Union, is a fantasy of the Cold War, not a realistic vision of the possibilities in 1941. To be more specific, it is an American fantasy. The Anglo-American invasion force of 1944 was the only military force in World War II to fully conform to the modern model of a motorized army. The German army was not poor in motor transport because it had neglected to prepare properly. It was poor because of the incomplete industrial and economic development of Germany itself. Most German freight transport in the 1940s was accomplished by rail. For short distances, the horse was still essential in both town and countryside.

No one, however, could deny the sheer vastness of the Soviet Union, and this alone made Barbarossa into a daunting proposition. Beneath the thick layer of hubris and optimism that surrounded the planning for Barbarossa, there were those in Berlin who expressed severe misgivings from the start. The doubts, interestingly, were of two kinds. There were at least some officers who questioned the feasibility of the operation itself. Significantly these included Field Marshal Fedor von Bock, commander of Army Group Centre, to whom fell the awesome task of crushing the main body of the Red Army en route to Moscow. By the end of January 1941, Bock was so concerned about the scale of the mission assigned to his army group that he forced Halder, the chief of army staff, to concede that there was a distinct possibility that the Red Army might escape beyond the Dnieper-Dvina line.2! What would happen in this eventuality was the key question. One of the earliest war games done to test the Barbarossa plan concluded that unless both the destruction of the Red Army and the capture of Moscow could be accomplished within a matter of months, Germany would face a ‘long-drawn- out war, beyond the capacity of the German armed forces to wage’.22 Generalmajor Marcks, the officer commissioned to prepare the first draft for the plan of attack, also prepared a wide-ranging strategic assessment of the campaign, in which he considered the possibility that the Red Army might be able to prolong the battle beyond the autumn of 1941. Then, Marcks conceded, Germany would need to prepare itself for a war on two fronts against a coalition consisting of the Soviet Union and the British Empire, backed by the economic potential of the United States. Faced with this unappeal- ing prospect Marcks consoled himself with the belief that if Germany could take possession of the grain lands of the Ukraine and s

Ever since the 1920s, when full metal aircraft had first been introduced, German aircraft engineers had estimated that costs would decline in a geometric progression, as the scale of production increased.101 They had even calculated a formula describing these so-called learning-curve effects in algebraic terms. And experience in the 1940s proved that these predictions were remarkably accurate. Costs plunged as each factory concentrated on ‘its’ standard model. Germany continued to manufacture in somewhat smaller batches than did the Americans. But what is striking about the production record after 1942 is not how far apart but how close per capita productivity became. Whereas in most manufacturing industry the United States enjoyed an advantage over Ger- many of at least 2:1, the differential in airframes in 1942 and 1943 was no more than 50 per cent.102 But the price that Germany paid for this quantitative expansion in output was a high one: the increasing technological obsolescence of the Luftwaffe’s armoury. As early as October 1941 a commis- sion of front-line airmen, charged by the air staff with evaluating the Luftwaffe’s development programme, had expressed horrified disbelief at Milch’s demand for a large increase in the production of Heinkel 111s.103 The Luftwaffe had first tested this medium bomber in February 1934, when Goering’s air force was still in its clandestine phase. At the time the He 111 had been an advanced aircraft and had benefited from continuous upgrading. But in the autumn of 1941 Luftwaffe commanders considered it unsuitable for use over Britain, even under cover of night. As it turned out, the He 111, along with the Luftwaffe’s other twin-engined aircraft such as the Me 110 and 210/410, gained a new lease on life after 1942 in a defensive role, as night fighters in the battle against the RAF. Since RAF Bomber Command flew its missions without fighter escorts, the task of night interc

According to the records of the Four Year Plan, no less than 2.5 billion Reichsmarks were channelled into Krauch’s chemicals projects in 1940 and 1941.26 this aircraft was turning into one of the great development disasters of the war.62 The same could also be said of Heinkel’s long-range strategic bomber, the four-engined He 177. The future of the Luftwaffe as a strategic weapon, and Heinkel’s future as a major aircraft developer, depended on the performance of this plane. A dedicated factory annexe had been built at Heinkel’s state-funded plant in Oranienburg, laid out specifically to enable the large-scale employment of concentration camp labour, a major new experiment for the armaments industries.£1 However, thanks largely to its absurd specifications, which called for dive-bombing capability, the He 177 was a disaster. Its wings were prone to falling off and its peculiar back-to-back engine configuration resulted in frequent self-combustion.§2 In light of these technical difficulties, it is hardly surprising that the Reich Air Ministry in early 1941 found it hard to come up with a coherent long-range production plan. The Luftwaffe urgently needed a new generation of aircraft and this seemed all the more important given the worrying news about the American plans for mass-production. Germany’s only hope, it seemed, was to counter quantity with quality. As the Luftwaffe chief of staff put it, in far from optimistic tones, in September 1941: ‘If there is any

But his aggressive rhetoric of reform and improvement must be seen in context. What Werner was voicing was the critique developed true dud. By 1943 both had emerged as viable combat aircraft. What both aircraft needed was more time in development and a more reasonable design specification. In early 1942, however, this was little consolation to Erhard Milch. Hundreds of dangerously unstable Me 210s were coming off the production lines at Messerschmitt’s Regensburg and Augsburg facilities. Even more half-finished planes were piling up in the assembly halls, and parts for another 800 aircraft were already in stock. Milch had no option but to cut his losses and cancel the entire programme. Instead, in a desperate bid to match quantity with quantity Milch decided to concentrate all available capacity on the mass-production of those models that had been tried and tested in the first years of the war.102 The new focus on mass-production certainly produced results. By the summer of 1943, aircraft production was more than double the level in the winter of 1941-2. The gap that had opened up between Britain and Germany was substantially reduced. For the first time, the German aircraft industry was able to achieve substantial economies of scale. The resources pumped into the Luftwaffe in 1940-41 were now concentrated in mass assembly. The available machine tools were set up in an efficient manner to produce long series of identical aircraft. There was nothing miraculous about  this

On the assumption that Field Marshal Manstein could hold Krivoj Rog, the RVE predicted that it could reach 3 million monthly tons of steel by October 1944, rising to 3.25 million tons in April of 1945.23 On this basis, Speer expected armaments output to go on increasing, at the spectacu- lar rate achieved in his first year of office, for at least another year.  In the spring of 1943, however, the German war economy itself was sucked directly into the fighting. As we have seen, the threat of Anglo-American bombing had bulked large in German strategic thinking at least since 1940. But until early 1943 it proved remarkably easy to counter. The Royal Air Force simply did not have enough heavy bombers to do sustained damage to the German home front, nor did it have the technology necessary to guide them to their targets. The heavy air raids on Luebeck (28/29 March 1942), Rostock (23/24 April 1942) and the ‘thousand-bomber raids’ on Cologne (30/31 May 1942) and Essen (1 June 1942) gave some indication of what was in store, but they did not develop into a sustained campaign of aerial destruction.26 It was not until March 1943 that RAF Bomber Command had the planes with which to mount a prolonged attack on the heart of German heavy industry, or the technology with which to guide them to their targets. The ‘Battle of the Ruhr’ began on 5 March with an attack on the industrial city of Essen, the home of Krupp.22 Between 8.58 p.m. and 9.36 p.m., following the invisible beam of the OBOE electronic guidance system,

The Me 210, the Panther and Tiger tanks, the V1 and V2 rockets, the variety of jet and rocket aircraft, the Mark XXI U-boat, were all promising weapons. By the end of the conflict, the Panther, which had been such a disappointment at Kursk, had developed into a combat vehicle that was the envy of the Western powers and the model for post-war Main Battle Tank development. 72 Its early teething problems, like those of the other miracle weapons, resulted from the fact that it was rushed into combat and mass-production without adequate testing.

As an illustration of the predicament of the German war effort in the later stages of World War II, it is tempting to use the much-hailed Mark XXI U-boat, which exemplifies both the increasing unreality of German armaments propaganda and the increasingly authoritarian style of the Speer Ministry.89 In 1942 ship-building had illustrated relations between the Speer Ministry and German industry at their most cordial. Though naval procurement initially remained outside Speer’s remit, Fritz Todt had discussed setting up a Main Committee as early as the autumn of 1941. He had been enthusiastically seconded in this by Rudolf Blohm, who as the owner of the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg was by far the most prominent ship-builder in the country. Blohm was a reactionary capitalist in the Roechling mould and like Roechling he was one of Hitler’s favourites. As chair of the Main Committee from the spring of 1942, Blohm worked closely with Ernst C
