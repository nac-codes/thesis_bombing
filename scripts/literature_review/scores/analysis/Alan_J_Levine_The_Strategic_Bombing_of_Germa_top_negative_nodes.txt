Since, supposedly, the civilian sector of the economy had already been cut to the bone, the Germans were not considered able to shift production from civilian goods to weapons. The belief that German civilians were in a straightened situation was one of the reasons why people in the Western powers believed German morale soft. All of these ideas were wrong. Neither the economy nor civilian morale was strained or vulnerable. Before 1939 German expenditures on armaments and supporting industries and "infrastructure" were considerable-about one-and- one-half times that of Britain and France combined-but this was far from a total mobilization of the sort the Allied countries undertook when the war began, and that Germany neglected. From 1940 to 1942, British production of planes, tanks, trucks, and other war items was actually higher than that of the Ger- mans, despite the latter's bigger economy and control of a conquered Europe. German living standards remained high, higher than those of the British, until 1944. There was a "cushion," and a thick one, of unused capacity that could be used to repair bomb damage and increase production. The Nazis' failure to fully mobilize was not recognized until after the war. It has often been suggested that they coherently planned a "blitzkrieg economy," to support short, victorious campaigns, since they foresaw a series of short of- fensives, tackling one enemy at a time, rather than a long, multi-front war against a coalition, which was what they got. There are indications, too, that during the 1930s they did not expect a really big campaign until 1942 or 1943. Hitler thought that he did not have to mobilize his economy fully to support a war or wars of the type he banked on, and he was reluctant to reduce living stan- dards, lest it hurt his popularity. Although the Nazis pretended that Germany had been defeated because it was "stabbed in the back" by treason, Hitler, at least, knew better, and

At least for a time, it had to be content to attack the centers of German cities, which, with pending improvements of technique, it could hit. Unfortunately, although there were exceptions, the big industrial plants, especially those most important to the enemy war effort, were usually on the edges of cities or even outside them. In the heavily built-up centers of cities, any bomb was likely to cause damage, but these areas were usually residential and commercial, with some small industrial plants. Their destruction would have only a slow, indirect impact. A policy of deliberate area attacks meant accepting the idea that large numbers of German civilians would be killed. It had always been clear that even the most careful and accurate precision bombing campaign must kill civilians simply because civilians worked in war plants. Not even the tightest bombing pattern could entirely avoid hitting homes or workplaces right next to a target. And even the most skillful force would occasionally make gross mistakes in aiming or dropping bombs. Even if perfectly aimed and released at the right moment, some bombs would go astray because their fins were warped or because their tails had snapped off on the way down. The idea of conducting a war with "surgical strikes" (to use an anachronistic and silly expression) that would entirely spare civilians was a fantasy. That was generally understood during World War II, if not later. But while most people felt that such incidental and unwanted deaths were morally acceptable, there were qualms about deliberately attacking civilians. These reservations were eroded, however, by the Nazis' indiscriminate bombing and their atrocities, and by the desperate situation of the Allies.

The CSTC itself took over the functions of the Joint Oil Targets Committee.

The difference between precision and area bombing was not a sharp distinction, but one between varying shades in a spectrum. Up to 1942, neither was possible. As capabilities improved during that year, successful area bombing became possible, but it was still not a regular or dependable result. At the same time, attacks on some specific factories-for example, the Renault plant-became possible, but only in unusual conditions of weather and moonlight, and against light defenses. After the introduction of Oboe and other aids in 1943, area bombing attacks were usually successful, at least within Oboe range, while precision attacks on very large factories also became possible, even in difficult and heavily defended areas like the Ruhr. Real precision bombing at night, against most important targets, became possible in the latter half of 1943, probably by the late summer, even though the capability for it was not exploited until well into 1944. Yet another misunderstood watershed for Bomber Command was its recovery of the ability to penetrate deep into Germany in the summer of 1944. It appears that this was due primarily to the belated development of countermeasures to the Germans' radar and homing devices, and not, as is usually said, to the crippling of the German defenses by the loss of territory and gasoline. 191 The Army Air Force's actions have also sometimes been misunderstood. Its leaders, or at least those on the spot in Europe, were disillusioned with the self- defending bomber formation long before the disastrous losses of the summer and fall of 1943. The deep-penetration attacks were a gamble, to keep the offen- sive against aircraft and ball bearings going until fighter escort became available. The failure of these attacks was not due just to the fact that unescorted attacks were too horribly costly even as an occasional venture. The selection of ball bearings as an objective proved

There was no need for nuclear weapons to render war "unthinkable"- that idea was already widespread in the period between the world wars. The general public, as did air power enthusiasts, believed that in another great war cities would be obliterated by an avalanche of high explosives and poison gas.

Such fears, and a sincere revulsion against war-genuine pacifism was far more common between the world wars than it is today-were a strong influence in favor of appeasement in the 1930s. In its day-to-day work, however, the RAF did little that was relevant to anything it was liable to do in a major war. It executed a policy of "air control" in the more disorderly corners of the British Empire and its mandates-notably Iraq, Somaliland, and the Northwest Frontier of India-bombing rebellious tribesmen into obedience. Air control proved an effective means of policing the empire and enabled the British to economize on troops. This proved relatively cheap in both British and native lives, but it was an undemanding task that did not prepare the RAF for what it would face in the 1940s.

The RAF did not claim to be able to win a war on its own, although its staff may have privately hoped it could do so. It aimed at a policy of "strategic interception," cutting off the supplies of the enemy's armed forces at their sources, enabling the army to at- tack successfully. But the idea of striking civilian morale, like that of evading enemy defenses at night, lurked under the surface and made it easier for the British to turn to these concepts during World War II. The practicality of the RAF theories, and the crucial problems of navigation and bombing, were not analyzed in the 1920s and 1930s. Trenchard invested much of its small budget in luxurious bases, rather than in aircraft development or in experimental sta- tions for the study of war techniques. The RAF was confident in the destruc- tiveness of its small, high-explosive bombs. It was assumed, on the basis of miscalculations made from World War I experience, that a ton of bombs dropped on city targets would kill or injure 50 people. (In reality each ton killed or hurt 15-20 people.) When Hitler seized power in 1933 and the prospect of a new world war became real, the RAF had a corps of fine pilots, but was technically behind foreign air forces. The degree of rearmament that began in 1934 was still oriented toward imperial policing.6 Of its 41 squadrons, 22 had light bombers known to be useless in a European struggle.

The development of a U.S. strategic bombing force was more closely tied to a specific plane, the famous Boeing B-17. Although flawed, the achievements of the American airmen were remarkable given the strong hostility of the dominant element in the United States Army and Navy, which climaxed in the court-martial of Gen. Billy Mitchell. During the 1920s the Army General Staff harassed and snubbed the airmen. Although the chiefs of staff in the 1930s, generals Douglas MacArthur and Malin Craig, were relative- ly enlightened on the subject of air power, many crusty reactionaries had little use even for air operations in direct support of ground forces. Gen. Hugh Drum, who might well have become chief of staff in 1939 instead of George C. Mar- shall, held that antiaircraft fire could deal with any attack and that the Army did not need any plane capable of flying more than three days' march ahead of the infantry. Fortunately, General Mitchell himself, his less well known con- temporary and rival Gen. Benjamin Foulois, and a group of younger men, of whom the most prominent were Frank Andrews, Henry H. Arnold, Carl Spaatz, Ira Eaker, and George C. Kenney, all generals in World War II, formed an outstanding group of leaders. The American interest in strategic bombing dated back to World War I.

The bombers were never expected to win the war alone or avert an invasion, and they received a far lower priority than would have been the case had this been planned. The numbers of bombers remained quite small until 1943, and in the British case they usually did not attack German industry. Bomber Command's operational strength was usually below 500 planes until 1943; the Eighth Air Force rarely put more than 100 planes into the air until the middle of that year.

In a humbler vein, he declared that his force could not bomb accurately enough to deal with the railroad centers. On February 15 Harris and Spaatz jointly objected to the plan. Harris now suggested that interdiction would be effective. Spaatz argued that the proposed action would divert his bombers from Germany and endanger the winning of air superiority, because the Luftwaffe would not be heavily engaged before D-Day. Unlike Harris, Spaatz had a new strategic alternative in mind. In January the Combined Chiefs of Staff had expressed interest in attacking enemy oil produc- tion. Spaatz and Portal had then opposed this as premature; they preferred to go on attacking German fighter production. But on February 28, right after the Big Week attacks, Spaatz's planners and the Economic Objectives Unit of the U.S. Embassy in London concluded that the USSTAF should turn its atten- tion to oil. Spaatz decided that the arguments of the planners and the embassy unit were sound. On March 5 he urged Eisenhower to give an attack on oil first priority; attacking the Luftwaffe should get second priority; rubber and tire production third; and attacks on German railroad centers fourth-when weather prevented attacks on other targets. An all-out attack on synthetic oil plants in Germany and the oil refineries in southeastern Europe would cut Germany's gasoline supply in half in six months. Line cutting and bridge busting would stop the Germans from reinforcing and supplying Normandy.

A seventh, at Mimoyecques (Calais), was to house a third V-weapon that was a superartillery piece, a "high-pressure pump gun." It was designed to fire a special finned projectile, boosted by a series of charges detonated in a very long barrel. This was potentially far more dangerous to London than the V-1 or V-2, but it is uncertain whether the Nazis could have gotten it working properly in time for use in the war. The Allies promptly attacked the large sites, and in November they spotted the first of 96 "ski sites." Some correctly suspected that these were ramps for launching V-1s, but the extent of the threat was hard to gauge. Some feared 137 that the rocket's warhead might be as big as ten tons. Nor could the Allies be sure that the missiles would be merely area-bombardment weapons. And while the V-2 was hopelessly inaccurate, the V-1 could conceivably have been fitted with a radio-control system and used against precision targets-in fact the Nazi Air Ministry had planned this at an early date, only to drop the idea when higher authority wanted just revenge attacks on London. Some among the Allies regarded the construction sites in France as a decoy to draw the Allied air effort from important targets. Others feared that they were designed to house even deadlier things; poison gas or biological weapons were among the least fantastic guesses. The Eighth Air Force a

The city's population had been swollen by refugees, and those who dealt with the disaster had more to worry about than an accurate tally of corpses. Wild stories of over 200,000 dead circulated; even in 1963, David Irving's well known book The Destruction of Dresden claimed that as many as 135,000 people had been killed. which would make Dresden by far the most destructive air attack in history. The true number of the dead was probably 35,000-still horrible and almost as many as those killed at Hamburg. But Dresden left a uniquely bad taste in many people's mouths. Hamburg had been a major industrial city and had been attacked in the middle of the war. The heavy loss of life, then and there, had been relatively acceptable. But Dresden was bombed late in the war, and it was widely realized even at the time that it was not of much significance to the enemy war effort. The fact that something unusually bad had happened at Dresden became known at the time and evoked a new round of questioning of bombing policy in Britain, and to a lesser extent in the United States. With the war nearing its end, even those who had strongly favored area bombing now found it hard to swallow. The Dresden attack, and the increasing public distaste for the area attacks, prompted Churchill to start distancing himself from them and from Harris. The Americans were also embarrassed. The fact that the RAF had bombed Dresden as a nominal part of a joint Anglo-American program was not yet widely known. But the fact that the RAF attack on Dresden was closely followed by two Eighth Air Force missions, which had, albeit unintentionally, hit residential areas there, and that these had succeeded an unusually destructive attack on Berlin, seemed to suggest that the Americans too were now resorting to a policy of terror bombing. The fact that even visual bombing was never quite so ac- curate as the AAF had liked to cla

"Investigation seems to show that having one's house demolished is most damaging to morale. People seem to mind it more than hav- ing their friends or even their relatives killed." The British could count on get- ting 14 operational flights from every bomber built; each bomber should drop about 40 tons of bombs in its lifetime, making 4,000-8,000 people homeless. Even half the total load of the 10,000 heavy bombers expected to be built by mid-1943 could render homeless most of the people of the 58 German cities that had over 100,000 inhabitants. That should break German morale. All this, he pointed out, ignored damage to factories, as well as anything the Americans  The Strategic Bombing of Germany 40 The Reform of Bomber Command might do. Cherwell did not submit any calculations of how many Germans would be killed or hurt while being "dehoused." It was probably assumed that the number would not be great, since people in shelters should survive much better than their houses would. It did not work out that way in practice, however Churchill, Sinclair, and Portal liked Cherwell's minute, but Sir Henry Tizard an able scientific adviser to the government, tried to expose flaws in it. Noting that bomber production programs were never fulfilled, he suggested that Bomber Command would drop only half the tonnage Cherwell expected, with less ac curacy. The damage would not be decisive. Tizard did not fundamentally op- pose bombing, but felt that defensive measures at sea must take precedence Cherwell replied that he had not meant his calculations to be taken literally: even if Tizard's figures were right, the bombing would still have a "catastrophic effect." But Churchill was content with Cherwell's arguments. He did not ex pect bombing to win the war by itself; it was only supposed to soften up the Germans. In

Its new directive emphasized attacks on German morale, alleging that the "morale of the civil population" and the "inland transportation system" were weak points. The former belief, at a time when Ger- many controlled the European mainland and was marching deep into the USSR. and when most Germans at home had hardly been touched by the war, was a remarkable piece of wishful thinking. Large railroad marshaling yards seemed to be the sole precise targets Bomber Command could hit, at least in moonlight. To smash the whole transport system was too big a task; the immediate aim was to isolate the Ruhr by bombing the nine major railroad centers linking it to the rest of Germany. British railroad experts thought that attacks on a feasible scale would wreck these targets. If possible, the Ems-Weser canals would be attacked and the Rhine mined. To cripple road transport, the main synthetic rubber plants at Hüls and Schkopau would be attacked. On dark nights the RAF would simply blast large industrial cities to demoralize people, hoping that some of the bombs would damage railroad facilities. Lord Cherwell, Churchill's clever if erratic scientific adviser, had initiated a more thorough inquiry into the accuracy of bombing that showed that this plan too was based on false premises. Even meaningful area bombing was not yet possible. In August 1941, D. M. Butt, a member of the War Cabinet secretariat, 31 analyzed over 600 photos taken by cameras aboard the bombers during June and July, in conjunction with operational reports. The results shocked even pessimists, revealing that Bomber Command's navigation, and not just its bomb aiming, was hopelessly off. Only a third of the crews who claimed to have at- tacked their targets had even gotten within five miles of them! Success varied greatly with the weather, the amount of moonlight, and the position of the target. As many as two-fifths of the bombers had come within five miles of their targets in attacks on the French ports, b

The first 2,000 V-1's built were faulty, and were scrapped. The attacks on the French railroads also slowed preparations for the V-1 offensive. The Allies were content with having prevented German secret weapons from interfering with the invasion, although as it turned out, neither the V-1 nor the V.2 would have been accurate enough to effectively attack the ports from which the invasion was mounted. The Allies thought the danger over, when the modified sites opened fire on London on June 12. Although not a major threat to the war effort, the V-1s killed many civilians, and as repeatedly noted earlier, no government is likely to tolerate attacks on its capital without reacting violently, whatever the military wisdom of the attacks or the counteraction. The British were upset; they had hardly expected renewed  138 The Strategic Bombing of Germany Strategic Air Offensive/The Normandy Invasion attacks on Britain at this late date. There was wild talk of using gas against the launching sites or even of killing German civilians in reprisal. Eisenhower agreed to a major offensive against V-weapons sites. On June 16 he gave the V-weapons campaign higher priority than anything but the immediate requirements of the battle in France. In practice, it received higher priority than attacks on the French transportation system, dumps, and airfields. The Eighth Air Force and Bomber Command struck launchers and supposed storage facilities. An enormous effort was expended on V-weapons targets in the summer of 1944, including over a quarter of the tonnage of bombs dropped by the Eighth Air Force and Bomber Command in July and August. But much of this effort was misdirected by the British Air Ministry. It insisted on hitting the old ski sites, which it was known were not being used; the large sites, the purpose of which was still uncertain; and eight "storage sites" for V-1s, which the Germans had
