The decisions about what places would be photographed, which prisoners would be questioned first, and what Enigma messages would have priority were made by the organizations that would use the information to be obtained.24 In this way, those in the best positions to know what was important were able to focus the Allies’ limited assets on obtaining the categories of data that they needed most. But there was a negative aspect to this arrangement. Organizations charged with evaluating information also frequently develop an interest in the way it will be used. They become loyal to a particular strategy, seek information that confirms their choice, and attempt to exclude or deprecate information that challenges their position. This bureaucratic egotism played a significant role in Allied air intelligence and decision making.  There was a superabundance of organizations charged with evaluating intelligence in the spring of 1944. A highly complex collection of ministries, offices, boards, and committees had developed. Competition among them was fierce, and mutually agreed appreciations of the German economy were frequently more the result of a form of bureaucratic scholasticism than reasoned analysis.  On the British side, the apex of the intelligence pyramid was the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee (JIC) attached to the Chiefs of Staff. JIC was composed of the directors of the three military services’ intelligence sections and representatives of the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Economic Warfare. It had liaison with the American JIC. Formed on 15 May 1941, JIC guided British intelligence policy, supervised the administration of i interservice committees, coordinated, assessed, and disseminated strategic interpretations. It produced its reports using papers written by subordinate bodies and lines or by mail.12 However, the R

The intelligence structure serving the American air forces was newer and in many ways less developed. At the outbreak of the war, the Army Air Corps did not have an intelligence organization. It relied upon the army for data and profited from private study undertaken by the officers at the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama. When war began, the Americans hurriedly built an intelligence apparatus. But they relied on the British throughout the war both for facilities and for information. The haste with which the Americans formed their intelligence system dogged them until the end of the war. Arnold drew upon both his officer corps and civilians to form a number of ad hoc agencies to provide him with intelligence quickly while his regular organization was taking shape. Two of these, the Air War Plans Division (AWPD) and the Committee of Operations Analysts (COA), exerted an important if fleeting influence on U.S. intelligence appreciations.

On 3 July it was given the urgent task of preparing an aircraft production plan for President Roosevelt.33 Because the number of aircraft to be built depended on the purposes to which they were to be put, AWPD proposed a full-fledged strategy for using air power to defeat Germany. It produced an intelli- gence appreciation to support this based on overt sources of data and what the officers in it had turned up on their own before the war. AWPD was then dispersed, recalled in 1942 and broken up again.  COA was created at the order of General Arnold on 9 December 1942. It was composed of prominent lawyers, academicians, and businessmen in and out of uniform along with a few regular officers.24 Arnold had been disappointed with the level of AWPD’s economic analysis and with the appreciations developed by his uniformed subordinates.

To a degree Sir Arthur Harris was correct in opposing the single-minded attack on narrowly defined target categories. So long as the Germans possessed the means to divert resources among various sectors of the economy they could thwart almost any such attack. The inability to comprehend how the relative importance of target systems changed over time was the greatest failing of Allied intelligence after its funda- mental misappreciation of the German industrial effort.

The forerunner of the new interest group was the Reichsvereinigung Kohle (Reich Coal Association, RVK) created on 3 March 1941. The RVK was a reaction to Todt’s and Goring’s initiatives in the energy sector. In a shrewd move, the companies obtained as the organization’s head Paul Pleiger of the Reichswerke Hermann Goring. As chief of the RWHG, Pleiger had been a nettle-some opponent of the established coal interests. But he had also won their respect. The RVK was empowered to take all measures necessary to increase production, improve labor conditions for the miners, control sales and relations among the coal syndicates and their members, organize the regional distribution of coal, gather and evaluate statistics, and plan transportation measures.3& The Reichsvereinigung Eisen (Reich Iron Association, RVE) followed this model. Its goal was to eliminate the confusion arising from the competition among the twelve entities that then had a hand in allocating iron by superseding them. It would present a united front for both the iron and the steel industries to Central Planning. As time would show, it would also become a serious opponent of the RVK and the Reichsbahn. To head the new organization, formed on 29 May 1942, Speer called upon the maverick Hermann Rochling, owner of the Réchling’sche Stahlwerke, Vélklingen, Saar.22 As vice chairmen Speer named Alfred Krupp and, the man who became its de facto head, Walter Rohland of United Steel (Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G., VSt) and leader of the Main Committee for Panzer Construction.

Of more lasting importance were three other bodies, one civilian, one military, and one composed of civilians in uniform. The civilian body was the Research and Analysis Branch of the Office of Strategic Services in Washington (OSS, R&A). R&A came into existence during August 1941 under the auspices of the Library of Congress and Archibald MacLeish. It was composed of academicians drawn from a broad range of universities solely for their competence and specialized knowledge. R&A had access to a wide variety of overt sources, including America’s libraries and the holdings of business and trade organizations. It also received at second-hand prisoner interrogation reports and captured documents. It did not obtain Ultra.22  During the spring of 1942, OSS established a branch office in London dubbed Economic Warfare Division. EWD in turn formed the Enemy Objectives Unit in April to provide targeting information to the Eighth Air Force.22 EOU produced aiming point reports based on overt sources and some classified data but no Ultra.31 Manning the unit were academics who were given military rank for the duration. EOU therefore existed somewhere between the civilian world and the military. Its civilians in uniform were anxious to win the confidence of their military counterparts. They carried over from civilian life the academic’s skill in and love of bureaucratic politics. EOU had a stormy birth and would struggle with every intelligence organization that it encountered. Its unique degree of ego- tism made it a bitter opponent of all who disagreed with it and prompted it to subvert even those whose views coincided with its own.

Hitler visualized it as an imperialist war that would either conquer the territory needed for Germany’s survival or lead to the Volk’s utter ruin.22 Economic reality would be compelled to serve the adventure by the force of indomitable will.28 Hitler expressed the latter idea when he asserted that, “The state orders and the economy meets the requirements of the state.”22 The state, in this formulation, was seen as the tool of the Nazi Party.  The specific form of economic organization that issued from this conception was the “Leadership Principle.”22 Dynamic individuals would master problems through the application of energy and resourcefulness. Bureaucracy would be kept to a minimum by means of “industrial self-responsibility” the voluntary management of the economy by businessmen to serve folkish needs.31  These economic ideas were intertwined with similar military and political notions. Concepts of mobile warfare stressing speed and the innovative use of combined arms were developed by others and were adopted by the Nazis. Hitler applied them to his imperialist dreams by conceiving of a series of short, sharp wars of territorial conquest culminating in the final titanic confrontation with the Soviet Union.22 At the outset, the economy would generate only the military power necessary to defeat Germany’s initial opponents, who would be weak and isolated. The preliminary conquests would not only clear Germany’s strategic rear but also enhance its economic position.32  No formal statement was drawn up outlining this design.

Here photos were developed and interpreted for both the British and the Americans.18 Prisoners and travelers could be interrogated to provide clues about the thoughts and plans of decision makers and about activities in labora- tories or sections of plants that could not be seen by the cameras.

The third form of covert intelligence, signal intelligence, played little role in shaping air strategy before the spring of 1944. Its most important form was Ultra, the system for decrypting high-grade German cipher traffic generated by the Enigma machine. Ultra provided a wealth of data on military movements. But it told little about economic events because such information flowed over land lines or by mail.12 However, the Reichsbahn did use Enigma and in February 1941 its cypher, code-named “Rocket” and later “Reichsbahn” by the British, was solved.22 Therefore, Ultra was potentially a source of economic information of great value.

To the west and in Bavaria, they were in the hands of one of Pleiger’s nominal subordinates, the mighty Rhenish-Westphalian Coal Syndicate (RheinischWestfalisches Kohlen-Syndikat, RWKS).  The RWKS was formed in 1893 to protect the Ruhr coal mine owners from competition by pooling resources and limiting production to maintain prices.43 The syndicate determined virtually every phase of its members’ operations and enjoyed unlimited oversight powers.44 Over the years it drove out or absorbed all competition in the area and established regional representatives throughout western, central, and southern Germany, the Syndicate Trading Companies (Syndikatshandelsgesellschaften, SHGs), to deal with customers. By the mid-1920s, it controlled three-quarters of Ger- many’s hard coal production. Its dominance was reinforced in 1934 and 1935 when the Aachen and Saar mines were put under its sway by the RWM.45 The acquisition of the Polish sections of Silesia by the eastern region did not fundamentally weaken its position. The RWKS still controlled the nation’s primary source of coke and, although the eastern region had its own industry organization, the Upper Silesian Hard Coal Syndicate (Oberschlesisches SteinkohlenSyndikat, OSS), the RWKS was incomparably better organized and enjoyed more important political connections in Berlin. Its chairman, Riidiger Schmidt, was therefore one of the most powerful, if least known, business leaders in Germany.46 When he saw fit, he could balk government policy. So long

The more the enemy lost in maintaining long lines of communications, the more Germany gained, along with the ability to switch its military forces among the various fronts more easily. Moreover, the German army remained tactically superior to its opponents almost until the end.£ Nevertheless, even considering these moderating factors, Germany required every ton of steel, every airplane, and every tank that it could produce. Speer and Ganzenmiiller recognized this. Given the unquantifiability of the modifying factors, to say nothing of the quality of political and military leadership on the two sides, it is impossible to calculate with precision what reduction in production short of total col- lapse would have been decisive. A conservative estimate shows that in 1943 Germany was outnumbered 3:1 in tank production. Would a 4:1 ratio have made a difference? Would an advantage of 6:1 or 7:1 in aircraft instead of 5:1 have accelerated Allied victory?Z No one can say. But if strategic bombing could reduce arms output by a quarter or a third, not below targets but in real terms, then it could conceivably cause the finely balanced, highly strained German industrial-military system to topple. Therefore, as a rough guide, this measure, one-quarter to one-third reduction, will serve asa standard against which to measure the results o

But problems developed during December. Coordination between the mines, which worked irregular shifts, and the DR and barge operators was poor, causing cars and vessels to arrive for loading when the pits were closed. In January 1945 the Reichsbahn was unable to provide enough cars to transfer coal from the mines to the harbor at Gleiwitz. It cancelled passenger trains in an attempt to free locomotives and save fuel to support this traffic. But this prevented the already overworked stevedores from going to work.

In regions near the coal producing areas they were kept low, on the order of enough for a few days, while at more distant necessary.32  These were the chief coal users when considered in aggregate. Individual branches within industry consumed less, giving a deceptively low indication of their importance. It must be remembered when considering their coal consumption figures that industries were simultaneously using gas and electricity and that the fabrication of subassemblies, while not requiring high direct energy use, was nevertheless an indispensable part of the industrial system. For example, the munitions industry used only about seven-tenths of 1 percent of total coal production. Synthetic fuels used less than a tenth.42 In contrast the iron sector used well over a fifth.41 The critical consideration is that coal played a decisive role at every level of the production process, and because that process was highly in- tegrated, the functioning of each component depended upon the smooth operation of every other.  The image of a complex system of mutually dependent parts was very difficult for those involved in it to bear in mind. Consequently Paul Pleiger and the Reich Coal Association constantly worked to ensure that competition for energy did not hinder the functioning of the whole. In 1941 Pleiger established a set of priorities for coal distribution that put transportation at the top along with armaments plants, utilities, cokeries, and the military. A year later, he imposed a limit on coal stocks of two to three months, depending on how it was shipped, in order to prevent hoarding. But the guidelines were vague and not rigorously enforced. Companies relied instead upon established business connections, sometimes involving shipments from distant suppliers, to obtain coal in excess of the stipulations. Pleiger attempted to curb this in April 1941 by dividing Germany into

Goring hoped to use segments of existing bureaucracies to serve his purposes and so began by creating only a very small office. But over the months it mushroomed until finally in 1938, he meshed it with the RWM. Subsequently both for this reason and because Goring began to turn his attentions elsewhere, the Four Year Plan faded into virtual insignificance.24 When the war began, these power centers were competing with each other causing the utmost confusion in the management of the economy.

It crystallized after defeat in 1918, which it attributed to the collapse of popular morale due to economic hardship, and gained political strength and broad popular acceptance thereafter. It advocated the rejection of industrialization and liberalism and a flight to folkish forms of romanticism.25 The concomitant was the denigration of bureaucratic organization and the discounting of the role of the state.26 From this flowed an irrational conception of social mobilization as a fanatical burst
