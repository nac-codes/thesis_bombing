General Donovan tasked the R&A Branch to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the Axis powers. To fulfill this tasking and develop a comprehensive understanding of the Axis powers and their capabilities, the R&A Branch sought scholars from many different disciplines. At full strength, this Branch comprised 900 scholars from the following disciplines: historians, economists, political scientists, geographers, psychologists, anthropologists, and diplomats. Soon after its in- ception, the R&A Branch demonstrated its value with its thorough analysis of the German supply situation on the Eastern Front.  The R&A Branch began its study of the situation in the Soviet Union to determine what caused the German advance to stop, when it would resume, and to glean a better understanding of the supply requirements to sustain offensive operations.! The R&A analysts’ conclusions proved remarkably accurate. The analysts correctly projected that Hitler would resume the offensive in the south in order to capture the Caucasus oil fields, vice a move on Moscow. The analysts also correctly identified G

One of the first branches General Donovan established in the OSS was the Research and Analysis (R&A) Branch. General Donovan tasked the R&A Branch to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the Axis powers. To fulfill this tasking and develop a comprehensive understanding of the Axis powers and their capabilities, the R&A Branch sought scholars from many different disciplines. At full strength, this Branch comprised 900 scholars from the following disciplines: historians, economists, political scientists, geographers, psychologists, anthropologists, and diplomats. Soon after its in- ception, the R&A Branch demonstrated its value with its thorough analysis of the German supply situation on the Eastern Front.  The R&A Branch began its study of the situation in the Soviet Union to determine what caused the German advance to stop, when it would resume, and to glean a better understanding of the supply requirements to sustain offensive operations.! The R&A analysts’ conclusions proved remarkably accurate. The analysts correctly projected that Hitler would resume the offensive in the south in order to capture the Caucasus oil fields, vice a move on Moscow. The analysts also correctly identified German rail transportation as the critical limiting factor and that German strength on the Eastern Front was significantly less in the spring of 1942 than it was in the summer of 1941.!°! The accuracy of this study gave great credibility to the R&A Branch and highlighted the value of economic analysis to military decision makers as well as national policymakers. The R&A Branch’s accurate portrayal of the German logistic situation on the Eastern Front garnered the branch much attention resulting in additional requests for products and support. One of these requests was to provide support

This partnership ensured targets selected by the EOU for aerial bombardment sup- ported political and military objectives.  BACKGROUND OF STUDY  Establishing the Enemy Objectives Unit  In May 1941, nearly two years after President Roosevelt convinced Congress to revise the Neutrality Law so the United States could provide materiel support to the Allies, seventy-nine percent of the American populace favored isolationism.! Fortunately, this popular sentiment did not prevent the President and Congress from preparing the US defense establishment for war. Beginning in 1938, the United States ramped up defense spending to address the shortfalls in the defense sector. This foresight was critical and gave industry a two-year head start to improve its military industrial base. While the US Government was taking action to remedy its military equipment and manpower shortfalls, President Roosevelt confronted another problem--the lack of a centralized system of intelligence.  The Office of Naval Intelligence, the Military Intelligence Division, and the State Department maintained their own empire of knowledge.#! No central organization existed to collect and evaluate information collected. The lack of a centralized intelligence organization that synthesized intelligence data frustrated President Roosevelt. He felt blind to the situations in Europe and the Pacific, which made it difficult for the President to provide strategic guidance. These paralyzing uncertainties forced President Roosevelt to establish a national organization that could meet his comprehen- sive intelligence needs!  re a a ee aan wo. ree . faan ee ee ee ed reer — Sant  Page 1 of 52 5%  eee ee ee ee eee ee ee ee nee ee a er re ec eee re a nee eR RR ee RD OR ee NE RE SEINE REIN Shae BRA
