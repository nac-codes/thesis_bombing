Industrial facilities  were mass producing everything  from sewing needles to machine gun bullets; advances  in transportation  had made the world a much smaller place ; political  advances had given rise to massive "peoples'  armies" . Novelties  such as heavier-than-air flight certainly  fit into the pattern of unlimited  progress.

Sherman's  famed March to the Sea did not have the killing of women and children  as its object, at least not directly. As the historian  Michael Sherry observed, "In America, airplanes were seen as instruments  of progress,  not terrible  weapons of destruction.  1,8 The use of airplanes to kill civilians indiscriminately,  including  women and children,  was beyond the Americans'  concept of morality  in warfare. There was still a distinction  between combatant and non-combatant  and even though they agreed with Sherman that "war is hell", it should be so only in an ancillary  way -- not in the direct targeting of civilians  for military  purposes.

Hansell had been long associated  with General Arnold, but this new position  placed him in daily contact  with the hard-driving  commanding  general of the Army Air Forces . Arnold's  nickname  was "Hap" because of his perpetual  smile, but this permanent facial fixture belied this true temperament . He has been described  as ruthless  and capricious and drove himself so hard that he suffered  four heart attacks during the war. He met with his staff every morning , seven days a week. One Sunday morning he lashed out at a staff officer so harshly that the man's face reddened, the veins in his neck expanded,  and, just as he opened his mouth to speak, fell dead of a massive  heart attack in front of Arnold's  desk. Arnold gave his staff the rest of the day off. General Kuter knew of at least one officer  who was in the "psychopathic  ward at Walter Reed" as a result of overwork in Arnold's service. 30 Arnold's rash actions were legendary. It was not uncommon for him to have a sudden idea, literally  grab the 210  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 222 --- first staff officer  he saw, and send him on this urgent errand across the country  without allowing  the man to cut orders for the mission.

When the subject  was again presented  before the Joint Planners  on November  9, 1943, they were not prepared  to accept it without further study, but did instruct  Hansell to request that the Joint Chiefs secure approval  of the construction  of the desired bases in the event the plan became a reality. That decision  would be made in a matter of days at the Cairo Conference .19 On November 11, 1943, Haywood Hansell began a circumnavigation  of the globe which would bring him into contact  with world leaders at the highest level. On that day the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral  King, General  Marshall,  and General Arnold boarded the U.S.S. Iowa .

After the initial excitement  surrounding  the near torpedoing  of the President's  battleship by one of the U.S. Navy's own destroyers  died down, this group had the opportunity  to engage in serious discussions  about MATTERHORN  in a more informal setting.

Mrs. Hansell kept a diary of their Chinese experiences  and recorded  a very memorable  visit with the Dowager  Empress  Tz ' u- hsi. Apparently  Lieutenant  Hansell  had ingratiated  himself to the imperial  household by treating  a royal family member who had become ill. As a reward for this act of kindness (and as an indication  that the Empress wanted to maintain good relations with the Westerners  after the disastrous  Boxer Rebellion)  Mrs. Hansell was allowed to present young Haywood before the Empress . The imperial court made a great deal of fuss over the child, with the Empress declaring  that the child was the most beautiful  baby she had ever seen. Even though young Haywood would not remember the experience,  living in China would be an important  part of his childhood. His first words were Chinese learned from the house servants and when the Hansells left Peking the Dowager gave them a chest from her palace as a gift. 6 6 Ibid.The family's next duty station was in the Philippines where Young Haywood quickly forgot his Chinese , but soon picked up Spanish from the Filipino  house servants . Toward the end of their tour in the islands, young Haywood had an important  experience  which he later recalled: "In 1912 I got my first glimpse of an airplane .

First at Fort McPherson and later at Fort Benning young Haywood  got a thorough  introduction  to routine  Army life with its monotony  and red tape. Even though his father had the highest expectations  for him, his school work did not measure up. Once his father was tutoring  him at the dining room table and young Haywood's attention was diverted by an ant, prompting  his father to strike him on the back of the head so hard that the impact on the table cut his chin . In obvious disappointment  with his son's lack of discipline,  Captain Hansell decided to send his son away to the family's ranch along the Gila River in New Mexico to grow up as a proper Hansell should .8 Southwest  New Mexico at the turn of the century still offered the flavor of the old West .

Yet he learned more than mathematics  and the classics on the ranch. His lessons included roping and rounding  up cattle, living in a bunkhouse,  and shooting. Even though he accidentally  shot himself in the foot with the pistol he wore on his hip, young Haywood thrived in this new adventurous  setting and he drifted  even further away from his school work. Perhaps the most important  lesson he learned  was horsemanship. He served as a wrangler on a surveying expedition  and developed  a love for horses which would serve him well in later A

His favorite  teacher was his English instructor,  Stuart McLean . Mr. McLean made, as Hansell later put it, "devoted Browning scholars out of us," as well as prompting  the boys to read popular magazines with enthusiasm. The cadet honor system  at Sewanee was based on the assumption  that a "cadet's word is as good as his bond, " which meant that a cadet's word was never questioned. If any cadet were found not to have told the truth, he would have been dismissed  by the cadets themselves .12 13 By his senior year in 1920, Possum had been elevated  to captain of cadets .

When Arnold returned on December 2, Hansell reported his progress, and when the official portrait of the air staff was made, Hansell was seated in a place of prominence. 25 After the Cairo-Tehran  Conferences,  General Marshall learned that General Eisenhower  would command  OVERLORD. Even 207  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 219 --- though his command concerns were still global, General Marshall did not want to face the British who were still trying to get him to support the diversion of precious resources  to Rhodes. In order to avoid the issue, he chose to fly home via the Far East. Hansell was selected  to make the trip with him. A C-54 took them from Cairo to Karachi, then to Ceylon, where they fueled up for the long flight across the Indian Ocean to Exmouth  Bay, Australia. From there they flew to Darwin, where they were met by Lieutenant  General George Kenney, MacArthur's  air commander. Kenney escorted  them to Port Moresby, New Guinea, and then to Goodenough  Island where General MacArthur was conferring with General Krueger, commander of the Sixth Army, who was about to commence operations  on the island of New Britain. 26 egïc Air War, 148; George C. Kenney, General Kenney Reports: A Personal History of the Pacific War, (New York : Duel, Sloan and Pearce, 1949), 332.This was the first meeting  between  Marshall  and MacArthur in eight years and the only time the two met during the war. According to MacArthur's  biographer, D. Clayton James, MacArthur  considered  conducting  the Cape Gloucester  operations in person, "thus relieving Marshall of his presence." Hansell's  account of the meeting claims that if there was embarrassment  on MacArthur's  part he did not reveal it.

Hal George was working there for Major General Hap Arnold, as was Lieutenant  Colonel Ira Baker . At first Hansell's  function  was public relations,  but soon he was given a far more important  assignment  as Baker's assistant. Baker was executive  to the Chief of the Air Corps , which placed Hansell very close to the center of power in the Air Corps . Baker had earned the trust of General Arnold and, as Hansell later put it, "Ira...was living literally  hand in glove with Arnold.  1,9 Next in line was Colonel Carl " Tooey  " Spaatz , Arnold's  operations  officer. Baker said of the Arnold-Spaatz relationship  that whereas Lee had a number of lieutenants, Arnold had only one -- Spaatz . General  Henry "Hap" Arnold had been given the nickname "Happy" because he apparently  had a permanent  smile on his face . This "smile" was misleading, because  Arnold was a hard-driving  leader who expected  nothing less that perfection  from his staff .

He believed  in firm discipline  and demanded  nothing less than strict obedience. In later years, as corps surgeon he had prestige usually afforded a major general and received tremendous  respect in accordance  to his position  and rank. The sense of Southern  aristocracy  and of belonging  to the officer class had a great influence  on the relationship  between father and son. Young Haywood  was under great pressure  to live up to his father's  high expectations. 4 4 Ibid. 5 Ibid.Young Haywood's  mother was also a member of the Southern aristocracy. Susan Watts, like her husband, was devoutly Southern  but the similarities  ended there. She was a witty, intelligent  woman who had a wonderful  sense of humor . She loved to play practical  jokes and was a talented  story teller who enthralled  her children  with her yarns. Young Haywood, or "Hay" as she called him, was therefore  influenced  strongly  by two very different  personalities  and as an adult exhibited  the characteristics  of both parents almost equally. The self­ confident, disciplined,  engineer was the product of his father's  influence  while the literate,  romantic,  story teller was the product of his mother's influence. Through both he received  his sense of being a member of the genteel Southern aristocracy. 5 At the turn of the century  America  had just acquired  her empire and the Hansell family shared in the imperial 41  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 53 --- experience .

Hansell did not like the New Deal because he thought it was socialism  and that it abandoned  his father's (and his own) Protestant  work ethic . In 1940 he supported Wendell Willkie, probably because the Democrat-turned- Republican  had promised  an independent  air force . But once FDR committed himself to the rapid expansion  of the Army Air Forces Hansell became, as usual, a team player .11 10 Parton, 115. 11 Haywood S.

Patton furiously dismounted,  stopped the match and began to yell at Possum declaring  that he might be a good pilot but that he "wasn't worth a damn as a polo player ."

He had read newspaper accounts of the panic in London and could cite many other examples of the effects of aerial bombardment  on a civilian population:  "The reader who thinks I have over colored the picture  has only to recall the panic created  at Brescia  when, during funeral services  for the victims of an earlier  bombing — a negligible  one compared  with the one I have pictured  here -- one of the mourners  mistook a bird for an enemy plane." 33 Brigadier  General Billy Mitchell,  the American  air power advocate, had commanded  the largest single air operation  of 33 Ibid. 26  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 38 --- the First World War when he directed nearly 1,500 combat aircraft in the St. Mihiel Offensive in 1918. This operational  experience  gave Mitchell  a better understanding  of the existing  technology  than Douhet . He had more respect for antiaircraft  artillery and knew that efficient pursuit aircraft  patrols  could indeed intercept  and blunt air attacks . Mitchell  would make his impact not through original  ideas but through his advocacy of the ideas of others which were reinforced by  his own experiences .34 34 Weigley, The American  Way of War, 224-227. 35 Hansell, The Strategic Air War, 4-5; Weigley, The American  Wav of War, 226; Sherry, Rise , 18-19.During the war Mitchell  had been exposed to the ideas of Trenchard , Caproni , and Douhet . It is difficult,  however , to determine just how much influence each had on him. From Trenchard  it is probable  that Mitchell  developed  his advocacy for an independent  air force which could mass its power and be deployed offensively. He had a respect for the concept of striking at an enemy's vital c
