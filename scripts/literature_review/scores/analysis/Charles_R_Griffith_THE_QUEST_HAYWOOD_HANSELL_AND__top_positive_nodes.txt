" When they attempted  to test gunnery against head-on attacks, the gunners shot the A-20 target plane down.

The solution was to make field modifications  of B-17s by placing flexible, hand-held 50 caliber machine guns in the nose of the aircraft. The chin turret of the B-17G did not arrive in England  until September 1943. Another solution  was the YB-40, a "destroyer  escort" version of the B-17. By placing an additional  turret to the aft of the aircraft  and providing  more machine gun ammunition it was believed  that this new aircraft  could "shepherd"  the bombers to and from the targets . They proved to be less than satisfactory. 66 The other problems  which confronted  1st Wing gunnery officers included air-to-air  bombing, long-range cannon fire, and long-range  rocket fire. There would be no satisfactory  defense against these German tactics until the escort fighters appeared. 67 66 Once the B-17s had released their payloads, their weight diminished  and thus their speed increased  causing them to leave the heavier YB-40s behind. 67 Hansell, Air Plan , 125; Craven and Cate, II, 265-266, 270.Hansell was quite effective in establishing  combat doctrines for formation flying, bombing, and defensive gunnery.

One major difference  is that the crews in England had been trained in daylight, precision  bombardment from the beginning ; the 73rd Wing had been trained in night , radar bombardment . Most of the 73rd' s crews had less than one hundred hours flying time in the B-29 , only twelve hours of which was at high altitude . Hansell sent the bombers on practice missions to bomb Japanese-held  islands in the Carolines,  which will be examined  below. Technical  problems multiplied  with each mission. Hansell had less than a month to get the bombers ready to strike the home islands of Japan. 27 Hansell's  decision to switch the 73rd Wing to daylight operations  was not popular because many "seasoned  experts " believed  that the B-29s would simply be shot out of the air over Japan .

On December  13 eighty-two  B-29s attacked  the Mitsubishi Aircraft  Engine Plant at Nagoya. Opposition  was heavy for one squadron and total wing losses amounted to four Super­ fortresses  lost and thirty one damaged.

Electric  power would not be a priority  target; the invasion  was now the object of the air offensive;  and the report recognized  the bomber's vulnerability  to fighters. Hansell was, above all, a good soldier. When given an order he did his best to carry it out. In essence, he had written  a plan that met the necessities  of war but that did not reflect his true vision of the proper use of an independent  strategic  bomber force. 100 Hansell  returned  to Brampton  Grange to face another  enemy -- the weather.

On April 5 eighty-five  bombers attacked the Renault motor vehicle and armament  works at Ballancourt , Paris . Extensive  damage was inflicted, which cost the Wehrmacht 3,000 trucks and effectively  shut the factory down for some time. Four B-17s were lost in the action. The next day industrial  and aviation facilities  at Antwerp were bombed with a loss of four Flying Fortresses . On April 16 the port areas of Lorient and Brest were struck with a loss of four bombers . On April 17 the 1st Bomb Wing struck the Focke-Wulf  Flugzeugbau  at Bremen . According  to the returning  crews , "Enemy fighters  attacked  in great force and with great determination  after the bombers  had passed the I. P., continuing  their attacks until 1355 when the bombers were 30 or 40 miles out to sea on the way home." 101 Six Fortresses  from the 91st Group and ten from the 306th were shot down, a loss of fifteen percent of the attacking aircraft .

Beginning at the first meeting, Hansell established standard operating  procedures  which would be used by each group in the wing. These "S.O.P.s" included take off and assembly,  route to target, target exposure,  return to England, and landing at bases. No detail was too small to be addressed. If there was a problem  on one mission, the S.O.P. would be changed for the next mission. Once Hansell had made a decision, the group commanders  were given "absolutely  no discretion  for deviation  until the next meeting." Hansell termed this doctrine "flexible  rigidity." The motto Hansell selected for the 1st Bombardment Wing expressed his expectations  for the bomber crews: "Put the Bombs on the Target . " 61 Hansell realized  that the most critical  tactical  problem he faced was the penetration  of German air defenses. With no 167  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 179 --- long-range  escorts available,  the bombers would have to rely upon their defensive  firepower  enhanced  by their formations . It had already  been determined  that an element of sixty B-17s was too unwieldy  and a simple element of three offered little defensive  firepower . When Hansell came on board, he found that Kuter was already experimenting  with the "combat box," which had originated  with Colonel LeMay and the 305th Group . Three aircraft  comprised  an element, two elements  comprised  a squadron , and three squadrons  comprised  a group , thus creating a combat box of eighteen  aircraft,  which was the smallest  unit for defensive  purposes  and the largest that could be handled on the bomb run. Hansell then created two tactical combat wings of three co

Hansell's  lectures reveal a lack of concern  over enemy opposition  in the air : "The Pursuit Section  here at the School ... feels that units of perhaps 12 to 15 pursuit airplanes  might engage bombardment  units of almost any size. Of course, with a numerical  inferiority  the 84  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 96 --- defending  pursuit may not shoot down many bombers ."87 As we have seen, the level of pursuit technology  of the time did not offer much promise of a viable defense against bombers. Because of the lack of early warning systems in the 1930s Hansell estimated  that a city would need at least 900 pursuit aircraft to provide adequate defense and came to the conclusion  that, "... it is not feasible to provide pursuit defenses  on a broad scale that are capable of adequate  defense against enemy bombers." 88 89 Yet he did caution that the students should be careful about accepting that type of general statement . Technology  was constantly  changing  and no one could tell what the future might hold. But at that time Hansell pointed out that bombers would have the advantage  of initiative  in the absence on early warning. He did, however, seem to recognize  the potential  value of pursuit escort for bombers,  but concluded  that, "Although  accompanying  pursuit is highly desirable, it cannot normally be counted upon in attacks against the interior  because of the limited range of pursuit aviation. 1,89 At any rate, since pursuit aviation lacked the capacity to attack strategic  ground targets it should not be included in a striking force.

Engine problems  were solved by making modifications  to the exhaust valves. The gunners' bubbles iced over at altitude,  but this was solved by fitting the bubbles  with hot air hoses. Most of the mechanical  problems  demanded  the attention  of Hansell and work went on at a furious pace, with most of the problems solved only at the eleventh  hour. 5 The bombers  had no practice  in formation  flying. Hansell directed  that tests be conducted  in which the B-29s fly from their bases in Kansas to Havana, Cuba, roughly the distance from the Marianas to Tokyo . The training stressed takeoff, assembly,  rendezvous,  formation  flying, and simulated  frontal weather  penetration.  The main result of the training  missions was that B-29s were scattered  all over the Gulf States. It was clear that the bomber crews would have to complete  their 237  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 249 --- training  in the Marianas , because there simply was not enough time and the pressure to deploy the XXI Bomber Command increased. 6 6 Ibid, 170-171; Coffey, Hap, 355. 7 E.

Practice  missions were conducted when the weather  permitted,  but they were often disappointing. On one such mission the group missed its target by over half a mile — the target was Elvenden  Hall! With much trial and error the practice missions were going better and better. Just as the 3rd Bombardment  Wing was shaping up for an 158  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 170 --- operational  mission, Hansell was called to command the 1st Bombardment  Wing (Heavy) , the premier command in the Eighth Air Force. 41 41 Letter from Hansell to Longfellow,  December  12, 1942, Hansell Papers (Microfilm Edition) , AFHRC, Maxwell AFB; "Commander 's Notes." 42 Haywood Hansell, "Notes of a Heavy Bomber (B-17) Wing and Division  Commander:  1st 6 Months of 1943 - 1st Bomb Wing, 8th Bomber Command, " unpublished,  undated manuscript  in the At this time the Eighth Air Force consisted  of the VIII Service  Command (which dealt with maintenance  and supply)  , the VIII Fighter Command, and VIII Bomber Command. The VIII Bomber Command was divided into wings, with each wing consisting of numbered groups , each consisting of four numbered  squadrons. In January  1943 General  Baker could count on two heavy bomber wings, the 1st (which was equipped  with B- 17s) and the 2nd (which was equipped  with B-24s) . Since there were only two B-24 groups operational,  the burden fell on Hansell's  four. Hansell arrived at the headquarters  of the 1st Wing on January 2, 1943. Brampton  Grange, located near Huntingdon, had been a hunting  lodge and, therefore,  had no heat. Hansell later described  his quarters  as "the most uncomfortable  living accommodation  in England. " Yet Brampton  Grange was located  at the hub of Hansell's  airfields. The 303rd Bombardment  Group was at Molesworth;  the 91st at Bassingbourn;  the 305th at CheIveston;  the 306th at Thurleigh;  and the 92nd at Alconbury .42 159  File: --

On January 23 the 1st Wing launched  a disappointing  mission  to the Lorient /Brest U-boat facilities. Seventy-three  1st Wing aircraft were dispatched, of which only fifty-four  bombed the target. Fourteen  of the seventy-three  B-17s aborted  the mission  and no damage was reported  to the submarine  pens. Five B-17s were lost -- nearly seven percent of the force. The major mission of January 1943 was the raid on Wilhelmshaven.  Churchill wanted an American  day-light  attack on Germany and it was up to Hansell and his 1st Wing to deliver. Sixty-four  of Hansell's  B-17s set out for the target and only six aborted. German defenses so were confused that a British observer termed them "pathetic ." Even though German fighters  were out in force, only one B-17 was lost and the gunners downed as many as seven enemy attackers . The U-boat yards were not seriously  affected  by the attack, but the Eighth Air Force had made its long-anticipated  appearance  over Germany. 78 175  File: --- griffith_hansell.pdf --- Page 187 --- February's  weather  did not permit full operations . After two false starts because of unfavorable  weather, Hansell's bombers set out for Emden, Germany, on February  4. This raid over Germany  proved to be more costly than the first. Thirty- nine B-17s bombed Emden, stirring  up a "hornet's  nest" of Me- 110s, Ju-88s, in addition  to the usual Me-109s and FW-190s. This was the first time the Germans had sent twin-engined fighters into the battle against American bombers and the first time air-to-air  bombing  was used. Five B-17s were lost.
