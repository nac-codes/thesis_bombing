Paralysis  of an adversary consists of physical, mental, and moral dimensions. As a strategy, it entails the nonlethal intent to physically disable and mentally disorient an enemy so as to induce his moral collapse. Although nonlethal intent does not necessarily preclude destructive action or prevent fatal results, it does seek to minimize these negative outcomes as much as possible. 6 These physical, mental, and moral effects may be short or long term, as required by one’s grand strategy. Put another way, strategic paralysis  aims at the enemy’s physical and mental capabilities to indirectly engage and defeat his moral will .7 In addition to his threefold order, Fuller  offers another theoretical proposition in Foundations that helps define strategic paralysis . Appropriate for any scientist of war, Fuller establishes a variety of battle principles to assist his students of military strategy . The overriding principle that governs the conduct of war—the “law” from which he derives nine subordinate principles—is economy of force . What this law contributes to the definition of strategic paralysis  is the concept of expending minimum effort to produce maximum effect—something Paris did quite well against his nemesis Achilles.FADOK 359  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 384 --- Having constructed a partial definition of paralysis  (a three-dimensional strategy characterized by nonlethal intent and force economization), we can now examine this notion in light of Delbruck ’s typology, to further refine our concept by demonstrating what strategic paralysis  is not.

In a truly seminal work with a distinct Clausewitzian  flavor, Delbruck presents a comprehensive History of the Art of War within the Framework of Political History . In it, he addresses two traditional strategies  of combat—annihilation  and attrition . The strategy of annihilation  aims to destroy enemy armed forces, whereas the strategy of attrition  seeks to exhaust them. Unfortunately, as Delbruck  himself feared, the majority of his readers misconstrued these as the strategy of the strong (i.e., quantitatively superior) and of the weak, respectively. Delbruck  coins the term Ermattungs-Strategie  (strategy of attrition ) as an opposite to Carl von Clausewitz ’s Niederwerfungs-Strategie  (strategy of annihilation ) but confesses that “the expression has the weakness of coming close to the misconception of a pure maneuver strategy .”8 Since by definition, annihilation strategy  always seeks destruction of enemy armed forces through decisive battle, he worries that people will misinterpret his notion of attrition strategy  as the constant avoidance of battle through maneuver . To clarify, Delbruck  further defines the strategy of attrition  as “double-poled strategy,” one pole being battle  and the other maneuver . A military commander employing an attrition strategy  would continually shift between battle and maneuver, favoring one pole over the other as circumstances dictate. 9 Thus, while strategies of annihilation  produce rapid decisions through overwhelming defeat of enemy armed forces, strategies of attrition  produce more drawn-out affairs capped by the slow but steady softening of the enemy’s will .10 In contrast, strategic paralysis  is a strategy neither of annihilation  nor attrition  but a third type of warfare. It does not seek rapid decision via destruction of enemy armed forces in battle. Likewise, it does not seek drawn-out decision via exh

It sought to produce strategic paralysis  by means of the psychological dislocation and terror that ensued from economic disruption and collapse. Meanwhile, in the United States , the Air Corps Tactical School  took the lead in developing American doctrine  for strategic bombardment. As mentioned, the preachings of Billy Mitchell  did influence this doctrinal development but so did the ideas of a fellow World War I  veteran, Col Edgar Gorrell . As chief of the Air Service Technical Section  in France , Gorrell was responsible for the Air Service ’s strategic air program for the war. Writing after the war, Gorrell  noted that “the object of strategic bombing  is to drop aerial bombs upon the commercial centers and the lines of communications  in such quantities as will wreck the points aimed at and cut off the necessary supplies without which the armies in the field cannot exist” (emphasis added). 74 He went on to compare the enemy’s armed forces to a drill bit. The “point” of the army would remain effective only so long as the “shank” of supporting infrastructure remained intact. Break the shank and the entire drill becomes useless. The ACTS  instructors fine-tuned Gorrell ’s ideas of economic warfare , transforming the “shank of the drill” into a closely knit industrial web requiring precision bombardment  to unweave it.75 They did not discount the potentially incapacitating effects on morale  that such pre

Over the months that followed, Gorrell  wrote a remarkably farsighted memo on the desirability and feasibility of strategic bombing . Perhaps not surprisingly, strong similarities existed among Gorrell ’s memo, Salvaneschi ’s piece, and the ideas then being expounded by Douhet .20 In June 1918 Douhet  retired from the army, disgusted with the inefficiency and conservatism of his superiors, and returned to writing. Soon after the armistice , he became upset with the government for not dealing adequately with veterans of the war. He therefore started Duty,  a newspaper that dealt largely with domestic, economic, and political issues. In this position, he learned that the government had launched an official investigation into the battle of Caporetto. The report concluded that defeat resulted from deficiencies in organization and leadership, many of which Douhet  had noted. The retired colonel therefore petitioned to have his court-martial reexamined. When the judges perceived the accuracy of his criticisms and predictions, they decided that Douhet  had indeed been primarily interested in the safety of his country—not in personal gain. The verdict was overturned in November 1920, and he was promoted to general. 21 Rather than returning to active duty, Douhet  continued his literary efforts. In 1921 he completed his most famous work,MEILINGER 7  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 36 --- The Command of the Air , published under War Department auspices—an indication of how completely his reputation had been restored.

The intellectual component of that transformation would center first in doctrine . The Air Force  experience in Vietnam  was not as searing as the Army ’s, but it did possess some doctrinal implications. First, the evidence on AI  remained mixed. Although it had not appreciably altered support to guerrilla warfare , it had substantially disrupted the logistical flow to conventionalTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 402  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 427 --- offensive operations. Second, seven long years of operating under a badly fragmented command system significantly reinforced the Air Force ’s institutional preference for a single air commander  in each theater of operations, working under the direct purview of the theater commander. More ambivalent were the implications of the Vietnam  experience for the theory of strategic attack  in negating an opponent’s military capability and undermining his political will. On the one hand, many Air Force  analysts insisted that Linebacker 2 demonstrated what airpower could do when politicians took the gloves off. 3 More thoughtful analysts, however, pointed out that no panacea target set  neutralized the military capability of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRVN)  and that President Richard Nixon  purchased the political objective of disengaging America  from Vietnam  with the carrot of concessions as much as he imposed it with the stick of airpower. 4 In sum, Vietnam  provided rather uncertain grist for the Air Force  doctrinal mill.

Chief of the Air Corps Mason Patrick further observed in 1928 that Mitchell had a highly developed ego, loved the limelight, and thirsted for public attention. Last, the legendary hostility between Mitchell and Benny Foulois was nothing less than class warfare. Mitchell, who was an Army blue blood and cerebral by nature, was the antithesis of Foulois, who was a utilitarian mechanic by temperament. It therefore comes as no surprise that Foulois later portrayed himself as a practical everyman compelled to deal with a skittish fop who was a talker rather than a doer, who merely “sounded” like an expert, and “who couldn’t agree on the color of white paper.” The egotistical Mitchell did have, Foulois grudgingly admitted, a “gift of gab,” but it only helped obscure his lack of practical success in the field. From the standpoint of the Air Corps and its future, what mattered was that Hap Arnold was an admirer of Mitchell. (He was, as Mitchell put it, “one of my boys.”) From the standpoint of ACTS, what mattered was that key members of its faculty—Thomas Milling, William Sherman, Herbert Dargue, Harold Lee George, and others—were equally devoted. At Mitchell’s trial, for example, George tried vainly to testify on his mentor’s behalf, but his interlocutors deliberately restricted him to answering narrow technical questions.

It is a senseless, inhuman method of warfare which I believe will never succeed against any nation of stamina and spirit.” 40 Wing Commander Arthur Tedder  (later Marshal of the Royal Air Force  Lord Tedder) similarly argued, “Terrorising of enemy people as a whole by indiscriminate bombing  does not comply with principles of concentration. It is morally indefensible, politically inexpedient and militarily ineffective.” 41 One must note that the RAF  opposed bombing other than legitimate military targets  not merely for humanitarianTHE PATHS OF HEAVEN 56  File: --- meilinger_evolution.pdf --- Page 85 --- reasons. Public opinion played a significant role, as did the purely practical matter of urban bombing ’s inefficiency. Because gas warfare  had been outlawed in 1925, the amount of high explosive necessary to cause significant damage to a major city was enormous. Given the modest size of the RAF and its bomber aircraft , pilots would do better to drop their payloads on specific targets. Moreover, Britain  felt particularly vulnerable to air attack  because its key center of gravity  was, unquestionably, London . The concentration of political, financial, social, and industrial power in the London  area made it the most valuable target in the country. Worse, its proximity to the English Channel  put it within easy striking range of air bases on the Continent. The fear of a “bolt from the blue” against London  preoccupied British political and military leaders from the early 1920s on. In 1932 former prime minister Stanley Baldwin  made his glum prediction that the bomber  would always get through. He added his pessimistic assessment

In short, since punitive deterrence  might not suffice, one might require deterrence by denial . The response to this argument essentially amounted to a reiteration of the fundamentals of MAD . As Robert Jervis , the standard bearer of opposition to the nuclear war fighters in the 1980s, put it, “MAD  Is a Fact, Not a Policy.” 72 Whatever the differences among states’ nuclear doctrines  and worldviews, the basic logic of MAD  is an inevitable consequence of the effects of nuclear weapons  and states’  pursuit of national survival. A state would have to behave with an unprecedented degree of irrationality in order to deliberately run a considerable risk of its own annihilation. Moreover, Jervis  notes that irrationality may be more likely to reduce a state’s willingness to take risks than it is to increase it. 73 The various arguments of the war-fighting school were mutually supporting but not entirely interdependent. One could accept some and reject others. Their most significant interconnection lay in the policy prescriptions that followed from them: all implied that the United States  ought to invest heavily in the development of tools required for nuclear war fighting . These included, among other things, highly robust C 2 systems and weapons optimized for counterforce attacks against hard targets. Perhaps most important of all, nuclear war fighting  called for strategic defenses —the bête noir of MAD  enthusiasts.

Many of his writings appeared in the popular press—not the professional military journals—because his intended audience was not the officer corps. In the aftermath of the “War  to End All Wars,” however, he found that his message could not persuade a populace beset by isolationism. Still, his progressive notions endured among airmen and provided the foundations for the bombing doctrine  they developed during the interwar years. After the armistice , Mitchell  began his airpower crusade in earnest. Although a recognized war hero—he had won the Distinguished Service Cross and the Distinguished Service Medal, as well as several foreign decorations—his quick tongue and steadfast beliefs prevented him from commanding the Air Service . He therefore had to settle for assistant chief, which, significantly, carried with it a brigadier general’s rank. Most officers had risen rapidly to high rank during the war, only to sink just as quickly to their “permanent” rank after the war ended and demobilization began. Foulois , for example, reverted to major, and Major General Patrick  to the rank of colonel. Mitchell  was, therefore, extremely fortunate to keep his star. Nonetheless, he stubbornly refused to cater to his Air Service  chief, Maj Gen Charles T. Menoher , an infantryman who had led the 42d “Rainbow” Division  in World War I . Despite Menoher ’s warning, Mitchell  illicitly published his report of the 1921 Ostfriesland  sinking. In the resulting power struggle, Menoher  resigned in protest, left the Air Service , and returned to the infantry (later he would be promoted to lieutenant general). Menoher ’s successor was Mason Patrick , who was promoted back to major general and once again called to keep the rambunctious Mitchell  in line.

Not content to criticize air control  as immoral, some people charged that air bombardment in general was indiscriminate and in violation of international laws  regarding the immunity of noncombatants. Repeatedly, RAF  leaders decried any such intention. In a strongly worded and lengthy memo to the other service chiefs, Trenchard  rejected claims that the RAF  was intent on population bombing . Attacking legitimate objectives in populated areas was inevitable, and “writers on war of every nation have accepted it as axiomatic” that such targets  can be struck. Terror bombing  was “illegitimate,” but it was a different matter “to terrorise munitions workers (men and women) into absenting themselves from work . . . through fear of air attack  upon the factory or dock concerned.” Trenchard ’s memo angrily concluded, “I emphatically do not advocate indiscriminate bombardment, and I think that air action will be far less indiscriminate and far less brutal and will obtain its end with far fewer casualties than either naval blockade, a naval bombardment, or sieges, or when military formations are hurled against the enemies’ strongest points protected by barbed wire and covered by mass artillery and machine guns.” 39 Another senior air leader, Air Commodore Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt , stated flatly that population bombing amounted to “sheer unintelligent frig

Writers often observe that Curtis LeMay’s bombing campaign against Japan in 1945 had a pronounced Douhetian flavor to it, as the armadas of B-29s inexorably razed one Japanese city after another. However, one should recall that the target country was effectively defenseless against the onslaught in this case. Not until a single penetrating bomber could destroy a city were the civilian populations of evenly matched countries vulnerable to rapid destruction from the air, as Douhet had envisioned in “The War of 19— .” See Giulio Douhet, The Command of the Air, trans.

Indeed, they have the effect of putting the political will to weaponize space very much in question. Emotional Factor Competing schools of thought lie at the root of the debate over space weaponization . In his book On Space Warfare, 18 Lt Col David Lupton  summarizes four competing schools of thought that surfaced during the 1980s, when the issue of weaponizing space  received a great deal of publicity. The Sanctuary School views space as a realm free of military weapons but allows for military-related systems that provide the functions of treaty verification, intelligence activities, and so forth. Advocates maintain that the only way to ensure the legal overflight aspect of current space treaties is to declare space as a war-free zone or sanctuary. This school calls for virtually no funding of military space programs aimed at weaponizing  space. The Sanctuary School of thought has a substantial following in the domestic and international populace, though many people within the military see it as a “head in the sand” approach to national security . The Survivability School also argues that military forces should deemphasize space access , but for less idealistic reasons. It assumes that space forces are inherently exposed and vulnerable. Survivability adherents assert that the probability of using nuclear weapons  in the remoteness of space is higher than in other media. This notion—along with the fact that weapons effects have longer ranges outside an inhibiting atmosphere, as well as the inherent vulnerability of predictable orbit locations—supports the survivability position. Remoteness also allows for plausible deniability of the attacker, which increases the probability of attack. The Survivability

Political leadership develops the theories according to domestic and foreign policy , ideology, and military-scientific achievements. Thus, military doctrine  reflects the economic, political, military, and historic character of the people and their international commitments. 4 Benjamin Lambeth , a RAND  analyst, defines this view of military doctrine  as “the sum total of scientifically based views accepted by the country and its armed forces on the nature of contemporary wars that might be unleashed by the imperialists against the USSR , and the goals and missions of the armed forces in such a war, on the methods of waging it, and also on the demands which flow from such views for the preparation of the country and the armed forces.” 5 Charles Dick  notes a dual social-political and military- technical aspect of Soviet military doctrine . Political and military leadership decides the tenets of military doctrine according to “socio-political order, the level of economic, scientific, and technological development of the armed forces’ combat material, with due regard to the conclusions of military science and the views of the possible enemy.” 6 The political aspect is dominant and directive, while military doctrine  forms the bedrock for force structure and military plans.

In addition, one did not have to attack civilians directly to produce a direct impact on an enemy’s will to fight . Although adamant about the fragile nature of civilian will , Mitchell  was less than explicit about how breaking it would translate into a rapid peace. His vision of such air attacks  was apocalyptic in the extreme: Tardy ones claw and clutch and scramble, clambering on top of those who have fallen. Before long there is a yelling, fighting mass of humanity. . . . Attacking planes, leaving New York a heap of dead and smoldering ashes, had proceeded safely to other strategic points where they duplicated their bloody triumph. . . . Gases produced by a conflagration in a city such as New York, would fill the subways and all places below ground in short order. 56 He thus thought that air raids would trigger evacuations of hundreds of thousands of people from great cities. Those refugees would not be able to obtain adequate food or shelter, and their plight would cause a war to end. “There is only one alternative and that is surrender,” he wrote in 1930. “It is a quick way of deciding a war and really much more humane than the present methods of blowing people to bits by cannon projectiles or butchering them with bayonets.” 57 Yet, Mitchell neglected to say whether “surrender” would occur because the government of the battered nation was sympathetic to the plight of its people, because it feared overthrow by an irate p

No individuals dominate this field, with the possible exception of John Slessor. But even his intellectual reputation is based largely on, first, his book Air Power and Armies,  that contains a collection of his lectures at the British Army Staff College in the early 1930s, and, second, his later fame as a marshal of the RAF and the relatively prolific (for an airman) literary legacy that he accumulated after retirement. One should also note that there is no history of the RAF Staff College—what Trenchard called “the cradle of our brain,” where airpower doctrine was formulated and promulgated between the wars. Moreover, there is not even a complete collection of Staff College lectures extant that can give us a definite picture of what was taught there. Excavating the intellectual foundations of the US Army Air Corps can also be a challenge. We certainly have available the extensive writings of Billy Mitchell, who published five books, dozens of articles, and scores of newspaper op-ed pieces. Unquestionably, Mitchell dominated the early years of the American air arm just as Trenchard did the RAF. Like his British counterpart, this influence was due not simply to his administrative position but also to his ability to impart a vision of airpower to an eager group of subordinates. The men who would lead the Army Air Forces in World War II—Hap Arnold, George Kenney, Carl Spaatz, Frank Andrews, and others—considered him their intellectual father. Mitchell achieved this status through the strength of his personality and through his incessant writing and speaking efforts, bringing the message of airpower to the American public. Unfortunately, Mitchell’s writings become almost embarrassingly repetitious after 1925 or so. Moreover, his inordinate and near-neurotic hatred of the Navy distorted much of his writing, confused his message, and left a legacy of animosi
