In a groundbreaking 1980 article, Schaffer analyzed the statements of AAF leaders as well as numerous wartime bombing documents in Europe and concluded that ethical codes “did little to discourage air at- tacks on German civilians.” In fact, “official policy against indiscriminate  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 22 --- 4  CHAPTER  ONE bombing was so broadly interpreted and so frequently breached as to become almost meaningless.” He argued that both the policy against terror bombing and ethical support for that policy among AAF leaders were “myths.” In his subsequent book, Wings  of Judgment , which also discusses strategic bombing in the Pacific, Schaffer examined the issue in more detail. He softened his harsh judgment somewhat, but he still concluded that although “virtually every major figure concerned with American bombing expressed some views about the moral issue . . . moral constraints almost invariably bowed to what people described as military necessity,” another disputed concept.9 Sherry’s award-winning book focused

Basil Liddell Hart, the noted British military historian, called the practice of indiscriminate Allied area bombing of cities “the most uncivilized method of warfare the world has known since the Mongol devastations.” An American counterpart, Walter Millis, termed such tactics “unbridled savagery.”3 Many American historians, including me, have perceived a dif- ference between the practices of the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the United States Army Air Forces (AAF), however, especially in the European theater. While the British embraced a policy of indiscriminate night area bombing as their only realistic option, the Americans pursued daylight aerial offensives against well-selected military and industrial targets that were justified by both “strategic judgment and morality.”4 Reflecting the Clausewitz quote above, the RAF targeted will, while the AAF aimed to destroy means. During World War II, the United States Army Air Forces did enunciate a policy of pinpoint assaults on key industrial or military targets, avoiding  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 20 --- 2  CHAPTER  ONE indiscriminate attacks on population centers. This seems to differentiate US policy from the policies of Germany, Great Britain, and Japan, all of which resorted to intentional terror attacks on enemy cities during the war.5 Schol- ars who have cited the official AAF history emphasize the intention of Amer- ican leaders to resist bombing noncombatants in Europe for both military and ethical reasons.6 Many of these writers contend that US airmen regarded civilian casualties as an unintentional and regrettable side effect of bombs Two contrasting views of Allied strategic bombing of Germany in World War II: a section of Munich razed primarily by British night raids (above) and a destroyed oil reﬁnery at Harburg hit by American daylight bombers

He told his commanders that “when used with the proper degree of understanding, [the bomber] becomes, in effect, the most humane of all weapons.” He also real- ized the political costs of indiscriminate bombardment, writing in 1942 that “careless inaccurate bombing intensifies and spreads those hates which will be stumbling blocks to international amity for years after the war is over.”39 Yet as the war continued and he pushed more and more for decisive results to support his dream of an independent air service, considerations of hu- manity were never a priority with Arnold. In contrast, at least one leader in Washington, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, did consistently oppose the intentional killing or terrorizing of en- emy noncombatants. Repelled by the barbarism of indiscriminate attacks on civilians, he had been instrumental in US government protests against such raids during the 1930s and tried to keep a close watch on American strategic air operations during World War II. Stimson’s diary is filled with references to atrocities and war crimes and occasionally with concerns for enemy civil- ians. He was convinced that the Nazi leaders and the secret police, not the German people, caused the war. The same sentiment motivated those critics of strategic bombing who concluded that workers in Berlin were no more evil than the airmen ordered to bomb them.40 Stimson complained that only General George Marshall supported him in that view: “It is singular that the man who had charge of the Department which did the killing in the war,  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 90 --- Lieutenant General H.

Even the official AAF history of World War II admits that “air force commanders actually enjoyed great latitude in waging the air war and sometimes paid scant attention” to directives from higher up.19 This means that the attitudes of leaders in Washington do not always determine operations in far-flung theaters of war. As Schaffer and Sherry pointed out, the leader in Washington most concerned about moral issues, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, was either ineffective or isolated. His position was basically administrative, and unlike the president or the chiefs  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 25 --- INTRODUCTION   7 of staff, he was not deeply involved in making strategy. Whatever their public pronouncements to the contrary, neither Roosevelt nor Arnold had any aver- sion to terror bombing when it suited their purposes. However, the extent of their control over commanders in the field should not be overstated. At times Arnold’s shifts in commanders had considerable influence on bomb- ing policies, such as when he replaced Lieutenant General Ira Eaker with Major General Jimmy Doolittle and Brigadier General Haywood Hansell Jr. with Major General Curtis LeMay. In addition, Arnold’s consuming desire to justify an independent air service put pressure on AAF combat leaders to produce decisive bombing results. Yet whether because of distance, heart trouble, or the complexity of the war, Arnold rarely wielded a great deal of direct influence, especially in key operations late in the conflict. Sherry’s contention that he consistently exercised particularly strong direction of American strategic-bombing operations and units is not supported by the operational record.20 This loose doctrinal and command direction resulted in a bombing pol- icy that was shaped by the operational and tactical commanders who actu- ally dropped the bombs.

The same forces and precedents involved in the assault on Germany in- fluenced the aerial bombardment of Japan, but more than just geographical distance separated the two theaters of operations. Americans perceived the Japanese and the Germans differently, and many saw the “Japs” as a primitive, cruel race deserving no quarter or com- promise. As mentioned in chapter 7, President Roosevelt even approved a project in which bats carrying small incendiary bombs would attack Japan; planners thought this approach would be effective against bamboo houses as well as the superstitious natures of their occupants.3 As John Dower points out, racism was evident on both sides in the Pacific. The Japanese were often portrayed as less than human in the American media, and polls showed that 10 to 13 percent of the public favored their annihilation as a people.4 Roosevelt, who thought the evil of the Japanese might be a result of their less-developed skulls, was convinced that Americans felt much more hatred toward the Japanese than the Germans. He carefully controlled the release of  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 180 --- 162  CHAPTER  TEN information on Japanese atrocities in order to keep a strong public reaction from threatening the “Germany First” strategy and to prevent retaliation against American POWs.5 Release of these stories began in late 1943, and they inflamed passions to an even greater degree.

Mission requirements usually prevented any sense of morality from being “an overriding criterion” on aerial opera- tions, although one planner stated that his group “took some comfort that our proposals would be much less costly in terms of the lives of civilians.”22 The need for Allied cooperation also tended to mute ethical arguments be- cause the British so strongly supported attacks on civilian morale and the Americans did not want to cause a rift or aid German propaganda. Although it is hard to determine moral positions from official records and correspon- dence, it is probably true that ethical restraints were not the most important limitations on terror bombing by the USSTAF. Such considerations, how- ever, cannot be completely discounted. At the same time, it must be noted that psychological effects have always been an important part of air warfare. Like the bayonet or the tank, the airplane has a shock effect that is intended to unnerve an enemy and break the will to resist. Unlike those other weapons, however, the long range of the airplane encompasses vast regions of the enemy’s rear area, inhabited mainly by civilians. Once factories became acceptable bombing targets as part of the enemy’s capacity for making war, factory workers could no longer be seen as noncombatants. Once the trend to recognize some civilians as belligerents began, it was only a matter of time until the justification would be made, as in Japan, that everyone supported the war effort in some way. The temptation to exploit and magnify the psychological effects of bombing civilians would also be hard to resist.

The first, asked by a professor during a graduate seminar at Stanford, focused on the precedents leading to the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and on why discussions about the new weapon’s employment dealt with how to use it, not whether to do so. The second, posed by a West Point cadet try- ing to understand the ethical restrictions on his actions in war, asked to what extent moral considerations and other limitations on combat can really be effective in a high-stakes, high-intensity conflict in a heavily populated area like Western Europe. In response to the first question, I believe that I have presented in this book many of the lures that drew American leaders and airmen down the path to total war in World War II, as well as away from the letter, if not the spirit, of precision doctrine. At the same time, I have also described how some leaders, for a variety of reasons, did slow the rush to unlimited aerial warfare. I hope that the material in this volume will provide future civilian and military leaders with some motivations and ideas about how to limit the slide toward total war in future conflicts.

He concen- trated on the bombing campaign against Japan and contended that strategists adopted the policy of indiscriminate firebombing of cities after precision bombing against military and industrial targets proved only marginally effec- tive in 1944. Though racism made such tactics easier to adopt against Japan, firebombing was the inadvertent but inevitable product of an anonymous “technological fanaticism” of Allied bombing and airpower. The assumption that using everything available would lead to eventual victory was key in the decisions to firebomb and eventually to use the atomic bomb. The Ameri- can press and public at the time accepted such measures as retribution for war crimes or as preparation for invasion. Since 1945, concerned Americans have focused on the decision to use the atomic bomb as “the moment of supreme moral choice”; Sherry argued that the whole bombing campaign was the product of “a slow accretion of large fears, thoughtless assumptions, and incremental decisions.”10 DOCTRINE , COMMAND  AND CONTROL , AND OPERATIONS Certainly AAF leaders had varying motivations and opinions about terror bombing. But a sophisticated understanding of military processes, particu- larly of doctrinal development, command and control, and operational ex- ecution, is needed to evaluate American strategic bombing. Both Schaffer and Sherry judged that the AAF failed to live up to the letter and spirit of precision-bombing doctrine. Sherry was especially critical because doctrine was not inspired and shaped to a greater degree by technology. Because of the limitations of the bombers of the 1930s, when precision bombing was developed, he argued, wartime technology was “more demons

This does not mean that extensive bombing of targets in Iraqi cities did not occur. American air strikes destroyed water, power, and transportation facilities in Baghdad in attacks suggesting Seversky’s idea of an aerial blockade. Strate- gic targets pinpointing electricity, oil, communications, supply depots, and transportation nodes were hit throughout Iraq. From the beginning of the war, administration officials and military leaders emphasized that command- ers in the field would be allowed to fight the war free of interference from Washington, and there were few limitations on targeting of military and economic objectives. In one notable exception, Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney ordered the JCS to review all missions over Baghdad after the bomb- ing of the Amiriya bunker that killed many civilians.32 Otherwise, the USAF exercised proper restraint regarding sacred sites and residential areas, though some collateral damage resulted from near misses or downed cruise missiles. Learning their lesson from Vietnam, leaders in Southwest Asia and Wash- ington responded quickly to counter any claims of indiscriminate bombing with explanations and photographs. Though the bombing of Iraqi cities disrupted civilian life, it did not break the Iraqi will to resist. However, the air campaign had a different goal: to cripple the Iraqi army in Kuwait through interdiction of its lines of commu- nication and by tactical strikes on its troops and positions so that a ground war might prove unnecessary. The results were impressive. Total air suprem- acy ensured the success of the efforts to hide the massing of forces on the western flank.

The tortured ethical calculus involved in deciding the conduct of the war and leading to the use of the atomic bomb could also be applied to enemy ca- sualties. A successful siege could avoid the costs of assault for the Japanese as well as for the Americans, though considerations of friendly losses were far more important to decision makers and bomber crews. LeMay wrote in April 1945 that he believed he had the resources to destroy the enemy’s ability to wage war within six months. This was Clausewitzian calculus at its most bru- tal; with no capacity left in the equation, resistance had to go to zero. When Arnold visited Guam in June, LeMay’s staff presented a briefing describing how their bombers could bring Japan to the brink of defeat by destroying all industrial facilities by 1 October. Arnold was skeptical but wrote in his jour- nal, “We did it in Germany with much more difficult targets and much more intense antiaircraft. Why not in Japan? We will see.” Arnold had already received a message that President Truman wanted to meet with the JCS to discuss the invasion of Japan and whether the AAF could really win the war by bombing; and the AAF chief decided to send LeMay back to Washington to assist Eaker, now Arnold’s deputy, in presenting the Air Force’s position. Arnold saw this effort as “another opportunity to make military history.” LeMay’s staff went with their commander and repeated the briefing they had just given Arnold to the JCS. General Marshall slept through most of the presentation, and LeMay came away convinced that leaders in Washington were fully committed to invading Japan just as they had invaded Europe.44  File: --- crane_bombs.pdf --- Page 199 --- TORCHING  JAPAN   1 8 1 Among the points that Arnold had wanted his staff to emphasize to the president and the JCS were the increased use of psychological warfare and the use of poison gas.

The reputation of the United States for fair play and humanitarianism is the world’s biggest asset for peace in the coming decades.”42 Discussing the topic later with President Truman, Stimson real- ized the validity of Air Force arguments that the omnipresence of dispersed Japanese industry made it difficult to prevent area bombing, but he “did not want to have the United States get the reputation of outdoing Hitler in atrocities.” He often agonized over sanctioning bombing raids and won- dered about the lack of public protest. Robert Oppenheimer recalled that Stimson thought it was “appalling” that no one protested the heavy loss of life caused by the air raids against Japan. “He didn’t say that the air strikes shouldn’t be carried on, but he did think there was something wrong with a country where no one questioned that.”43 Ronald Schaffer is especially critical of Stimson for not being more effec- tive, pointing out that his protest of the fire raids came almost two months after they started and that he could have inquired more into the bombing of Japan and Dresden. Schaffer speculates that Stimson

They have been directed at concrete and steel and not at human life. —President Lyndon Johnson1 For the men who dropped bombs on Japan, there was little difference be- tween destroying cities with incendiary bombs and with atomic ones. Spaatz abhorred both means, and LeMay wrote of the new weapons, “Nothing new about death, nothing new about deaths caused militarily. We scorched and boiled and baked to death more people in Tokyo on that night of 9–10 March than went up in vapor at Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.” The attack on Hiroshima was followed by the same psychological campaign that had been used for the fire raids. Leaflets emphasized that the new bomb was to be used “to destroy every resource of the military by which they are prolonging this useless war” and ended with the demand, “Evacuate Your Cities!”2 The atomic bomb would be used as its predecessors had been, to de- stroy urban industrial and military centers and to terrorize city dwellers into fleeing to the countryside. From the perspective of those airmen dropping bombs on the Japanese, the decision to use an atomic weapon

Yet at least in the European theater AAF leaders were not willing to achieve the same goal by intentionally killing women and children or burning down their homes. Even LeMay’s fire raids listed the destruction of specific industrial targets as the primary objective. However, once a supplementary campaign of psycho- logical warfare was launched to terrorize the rest of Japan with the threat of more conflagrations, differences lessened even more between this American air campaign and RAF Bomber Command’s area raids on German cities or the Luftwaffe’s Blitz against London. Other influences on air commanders also affected their decisions. Pres- sures from various levels of command and perceptions of public opinion helped shape planning and operations. Any military mission includes im- plied tasks to fight, win, and return with honor intact, but these elements have different weight, depending on where the soldiers are on the battlefield. Although Arnold hoped to achieve an independent air force with “Victory through Airpower,” his bomber crewmen were more concerned with doing the best job they could and surviving. Operational and tactical command- ers were caught in the middle; they had to be loyal to the goals of their organization and to the welfare of their men.23 A quick and overwhelming victory served both purposes and was also in keeping with the “Airpower Ethic” by preventing long and bloody land combat. The lure of achieving the Allies’ stated aim of winning the war “as decisively and speedily as pos- sible” through technological solutions or by a single operation to produce a deathblow became especially strong after the success of Operation OVERLORD in Europe and as the invasion of Japan approached.24 With the ex
