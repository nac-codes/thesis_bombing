Buck, then archivist of the United States, agreed to maintain the records provided some agency more qualified than his would assume responsibility for controlling access to the classified materials contained therein. Further discussions followed, and at length the director of the Central Intelligence Group (CIG, reorganized in 1947 as the CIA) agreed to assume responsibility for granting access. Several more months were required to put the records in some kind of consistent order—among the least successful of the Survey's accomplishments—and compile a general index of the materials. All of this work was completed late in the summer of 1947 under the capable, but by now wearying, stewardship of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Hurley.

Desks, chairs, typewriters, lamps, files, and everything else have been smashed up and spread indiscrimi- , nately on the floor. In most places you wade knee-deep in debris of that sort. The problem of getting worthwhile information out _ of records scatjered as much as most records are is almost a ’ hopeless one.  7 Even when production records were found in good condition, further problems were encountered. Statistical records, whether applicable to a single plant or an entire industry, were rarely com- plete over any considerable length of time;28 the very bases on which figures were compiled involved semantic nuances whose logic was not always apparent to the investigators;29 and increasingly evident among figures compiled late in the war was the perennial problem faced by those who place great faith in statistical reports—the com- pilers of statistics, under pressures from above, tended to become self-serving in their.reports, either telling higher headquarters what they wanted to hear or fudging figures to cover up their own inade-  quacies.  A final problem for the Field Teams, though one not equal in scale to those already mentioned, was that occasioned by the questionable conduct of some team members. As reported by one team leader, ‘‘looting and general enjoyment of the privileges of con- querors provide very strong attractions to those whose zeal for re- search is not personal.” So-called “improper looting’’ and ‘‘the yen to go sightseeing” had continually to be combated, and on a few occasions civilian members had to be disciplined for trying to obtain information of more direct use to their parent corporations in the U.S. than to the goals of the Survey. Also not infrequent was a tendency among some of the higher ranking civilians (not the direc- tors) to take their “assimilated rank’’ to mean that they could give orders to soldiers on matters not related to research. Some who held the assimilated rank of colonel, and hence were referred to co

Noting that there  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 37 --- 36 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  seemed to be growing pressure for a combined U.S.-British survey, Spaatz urged resistance to such pressures ‘‘whether brought to bear over here, or in Washington through the Combined Chiefs of Staff, or otherwise.’’ He offered two specific reasons for his stand on this issue:  (1) Any other arrangement would defeat our main purpose of getting at the plain facts through a committee headed by an impartial civilian chairman free from influence of official opinion on either side of the Atlantic.  (2) Soviet consent will be necessary to investigate German targets and records in the Soviet Zone of Occupation. Any prior arrangements for combined U.S.-British investigation would be inconsistent with policy indicated in cable of S May 1944 from Joint Chiefs of Staff to General Eisenhower... that in post- hostilities matters we should scrupulously avoid giving Soviets any bngsession of combined... planning excluding the Soviets. !  Whether or not such reasons reflected his innermost feelings on this matter, there could be little argument raised in Washington against the position taken by General Spaatz. He was, after all, the senior responsible officer in the field. He had himself recommended that the results of the campaign he was directing be investigated by an impartial committee headed by a civilian. His cooperation and support would be vital to the success of any such committee. He had, in short, taken an unusually liberal view of the whole question of an investigation. Now he raised one singular and firmly stated objection, backing it up with arguments of weight. It could hardly be expected in such circumstances that General Arnold would counter- mand the position he had taken.  As it turned out, the question was not finally decided until quite late in the summer. In the interim a series of meetings to

Mr. D’Olier, after all, had been ‘given a job to do’’ by General Arnold and Assistant Secretary Lovett. That Secretary of War Stimson and the President had signed certain papers was beside the point; D’Olier knew as well as anyone else that the Joint Chiefs of Staff were running the American side of the war. And now that war, at least in Europe, was drawing to a victorious close and there was still the war in the Pacific to go. What would be served by producing a contentious or critical report, one that singled out errors and named names? Arnold, Spaatz, Eaker, Doolittle, and all the others—men whom D’Olier had come to admire for their courage and their willingness to shoulder enormous responsibility—these men had led the way; thousands of others had given their lives.

At all of the staff meetings he sits at Mr. D’Olier’s elbow and to all intents and purposes acts as a presiding officer in the meetings. Due to his ability, Mr. D’Olier has leaned very heavily on him and | feel that many of the policies of the Survey are definitely set by Mr, Nitze due to the confidence that higher authority has in him.  Another important development was the arrival in April of J. Kenneth Galbraith to direct the Overall Economic Effects Divi- sion.4® As mentioned earlier, the search for a top-flight economist had been long and arduous. From the beginning, Assistant Secretary Lovett had all but insisted that the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration play some part in the Survey. Both he and D’Olier corresponded at length with Donald David, dean of the Business School, and sought in vain to get either David or one of his top professors to head the economic study. One after another, vari- ous prospective candidates fell by the wayside, either from lack of interest or from being found too theoretical or academic.  When Paul Nitze returned to the States briefly in February, he carried with him some notes drawn up by George Ball listing a num- ber of possible candidates for the economic post. Among these names was that of Galbraith of whom Ball wrote, “If you decide to tackle Ken Galbraith (who is now on the editorial staff of Fortune), you might mention my name as | know him quite well. Galbraith is an extremely energetic fellow of first rate intellectual capacity and a good deal of experience in running large research projects.

Your concurrence is requested.  The verbal approval of General Marshall and Admiral King was obtained,29 and a major potential hurdle overcome. For several months thereafter, his attention taken up by other matters, General Arnold assumed that all was going well. Yet it is to London rather than to AAF Headquarters that one must look to find the initiatives that finally got the project off the ground.  Activities in London during June have already been alluded to. Essentially they consisted of General Cabell’s continued sparring with the RAF on the question of cooperation and Colonel Ames’s initial attempts to devise a “skeleton” organization for the survey. Attached to one of General Spaatz’s early letters to General Arnold had been two charts, one suggesting precise manning requirements for the immediate planning stages,°¥ the other showing the tentative arrangement of the fully organized survey. These charts were similar in structure; the latter, called ‘‘Chart A,” is reproduced in Figure 1 on the following page. Two things in particular should be noticed: (1) the eventual size of the organization was still expected to be small, as few as twenty, as many as perhaps one hundred people; and (2) except for the chairman and a few technical specialists, the essentially military nature of the undertaking was evident. This latter point was made clear in designating the functions of the executive director, a position to be held by a senior military officer. He was to be responsible for “specific direction of the research” and “coordination of the analysis.”  From an original idea of a committee of perhaps twenty or twenty-five people, the proposed size of the survey staff had increased by May to a number between seventy and one

The Morrow and Baker Boards, of 1925 and 1934, respectively, were important milestones in aviation history; even earlier, in May 1919, “the Assistant Secretary of War, Benedict Crowell, led an official delegation of Army, Navy, and aircraft industry representatives to Europe . .. for a three-month study of English, French, and Italian aeronautics.” Hurley, Mitchell, p. 48.  3.

That this goal proved impossible of attainment has been shown in the preceding chapter. But factors other than inter-service feuding were responsible. As Henry Alexander had once remarked when con-  Home at Last 139  sidering whether the Survey should continue from Europe to Japan, “Nobody likes to ride a dead horse.” This feeling affected military as well as civilian members all the more so by January 1946. General Fairchild had been appointed to head the new Air University at Maxwell Field and wanted General Anderson to set up its senior school, the Air War College. The Navy Department was equally anxious to reassign Admiral Ofstie to liaison duty with the Atomic Energy Commission. More junior officers, with an eye out to their own careers, contemplated with foreboding the idea of remaining too long with an outfit that was going out of business. Civilians, too, had their careers to worry about. Yielding to such pressures, D’Olier and Nitze had to agree that at the higher levels, continued participa- tion in Survey activities would be largely on a part-time, as-needed asis.  In such circumstances, the pattern of continuing work was established as follows: individuals were assigned responsibility and timetables for completing various reports; these in turn would be scrutinized by the editors in the Secretariat, now under Mr. (former- ly Lieutenant Commander) Walter Wilds: upon approval at that level the

Begun in January, this task was not completed until August; the final outline of topics forms the Table of Contents to the Over-all Report (European War).  As work on the outline continued it became apparent to Alexander that not only the chairman’s final report, but also the reports to be prepared by the individual Divisions, would have to be organized and edited in some consistent manner. Unable to take all of this on his own shoulders, and harking to the advice of Ames and George Ball, he began to lay plans for the creation of a Secretariat. Early in March, Mr. D’Olier (in Washington) invited a former partner in Colonel Ames’s Boston law firm to become secretary to the Survey.

[ts first efforts were devoted to devising standard formats for the two basic types of reports that each Division would write: “plant” (or factory) reports and “ministerial” reports.62 As time passed the Secretariat became responsible for coordinating and drawing up in final form any procedure that had across-the-board applicability, e.g., Standard checklists and questionnaires to be completed during the inspection of each industrial target. When a decision was made to adopt an IBM punch card system for compiling the record of USSTAF and RAF attack data, the Secretariat expanded to include a Tabulating Services Section.3 Still later, when the fin

Eventually, a total of 212 European reports were prepared, all but three of which were published in one form or another. Many of them, like Orwell's animals, are more equal than others, only three bearing the unqualified approval of the chairman's office.?  Upon returning from Tokyo to Washington, then, Franklin D’Olier had become somewhat of a celebrity. Washington bigwigs, in and out of uniform, paid him court while he attempted to juggle his three responsibilities: finishing up the European reports, getting underway with the Pacific reports, and tending to his responsibilities at the Prudential Insurance Company, of which he was still senior executive officer. The main order of business, of course, was “the chairman’s report” on the war in the Pacific. As he had done with Alexander in Europe, D’Olier passed this responsibility to Paul Nitze.  When the chairman’s report for Europe developed into a document of over one hundred pages, a decision was made to put out a condensed version (hence the Summary Report in addition to the Over-all Report), hopefully thereby to encourage a wider reading audience. Similar duplication of effort was avoided with the Pacific report, Nitze and D’Olier agreeing that a short, concise report of thirty or so pages would be sufficient. The next question was whether the chairman’s office itself would issue any other reports. Deciding that something, surely, should treat the atomic bomb attacks, and recognizing that the detailed reports being prepared by the Physical  Home at Last tas  Damage Division were bound to contain classified information they decided to issue a brief and very general account of the effects of the two attacks.

Arnold then called on Lovett, explained the background of the survey idea, and asked if the assistant secretary, a skilled negotiator well-connected in the banking and_ business worlds, would undertake the business of finding a chairman and obtaining Presidential approval for the project.  Lovett, formerly a partner of Brown Brothers, Harriman and Company of New York, had been recruited by Secretary of War Stimson in December of 1940, first as a special assistant and after April 1941 as Assistant Secretary of War for Air. A Navy combat pilot in World War I, Lovett had organized the first U.S. naval bombard- ment Squadron and had participated with the Royal Navy in bombing raids on German submarine pens and railroad marshalling yards in occupied France and Belgium. Though returning to civilian life after the war, he had remained actively interested in aviation activities while pursuing his business career in New York.  Starting out, Lovett noticed that while the Plans Division was anxious to move ahead with the survey, there seemed to be ‘‘a certain coolness and lack of interest elsewhere”’ on the Air Staff, the project as a whole appearing “‘to be thoroughly bogged down.” In his efforts to get things going again, Lovett struck on the idea of soliciting institutional sponsorship of the survey.  The most desirable project from many points of view, including the likelihood of getting Presidential sponsorship, seems to be to select some outstanding impartial institution such as Harvard, M.I.T., University of California, etc. The plan would be to have such a group—officially if possible, if not, as individuals— accept the responsibility for monitoring the enterprise, draw on their specialized schools as well as industry for personnel.

Having noticed news- report on Admiral Ofstie’s Campaigns report, he wrote plaintively to Colonel McMurrin.  File: --- macisaac_bombing.pdf --- Page 84 --- 130 Strategic Bombing in World War Two  Dear Colonel MecMurrin,  I have seen several references during the past few days to the report of the Naval Analysis Division, which I suppose is Admiral Ofstie’s report. | was wondering if you could con- veniently send me a copy of this report.  Do you happen to know whether it had the approval of the Survey or whether it was his special report?  Sincerely,  (signed) Franklin D'Olier°5  McMurrin replied to D’Olier on 31 December, explaining the background as best he could, enclosing a copy of Nitze’s memoran- dum, and asking the chairman whether he agreed with the vice- chairman’s recommendation. D’Olier replied on 3 January 1947 that he agreed ‘absolutely 100 percent.”’° By this point, however, everyone’s wires were crossed and a general meeting of the minds was necessary. McMurrin wrote to D’Olier again on 14 January 1947 expressing General Anderson's dismay that by some means or other an exception had been made to the Survey’s announced policy in allowing the Naval Analysis Division to publish their report. Hoping to put an end to acrimonious debate, D’Olier advised Nitze that he should meet once again with General Anderson.  In February, another meeting was held, after which Nitze sent General Anderson’s report to Admiral Ofstie for his comments. Ofstie received the report on 3 March and was appalled at what he read. Beginning with a forceful attack on the original bases of U.S. strategy in the Pacific, Anderson’s report appeared to represent special pleading at best, deliberate dissimulation at worst. For Ofstie, its conclusions, which included a carefully worded, yet very plain, justification for a theory of “preven
