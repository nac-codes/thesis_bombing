The goal o f the overall U.S. strategy toward Libya was to make the cost too high and therefore induce a behavioral change; in other words, compellence. Diplomatic and economic sanctions had not proven to exert sufficient pressure. A minor military confrontation had also been inadequate. Thus, more important than simple reprisal, the raid would demonstrate to Qaddafi that the U.S. could impose a cost for Libya’s support of terrorism. The U.S. was busy pursuing diplomatic and economic sanctions against Libya, but the air raid would be a very 330  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 343 --- dramatic application of pressure. Qaddafi would hopefully understand the U.S. was serious and that the cost o f continuing his policies was increasing significantly. However, Reagan wanted to wait until he had a "smoking gun" to directly implicate Libya in a terrorist incident to ease the task of justifying an attack to the world. The Libyans provided the requisite evidence on 4 April 1986. The Libyan People’s Bureau in East Berlin relayed to Tripoli that they had something planned, a bomb, that would kill American soldiers."® Early the next morning, a bomb exploded in La Belle discotheque in West Berlin, killing two U.S. soldiers, a Turkish woman, and wounding 229 others."® Immediately after the explosion the East Berlin People’s Bureau sent word that the operation was successful and that it could not be traced. British and West German intelligence agencies intercepted the message, and the British passed it on the United States."" Justification, Objectives, and Strategy for the Raid At the same time, the U.S. intelligence agencies indicated that further terrorist operations sponsored by Qaddafi were being planned. The decision to launch an airstrike came quickly with little dissent from top level advisors. This was the only option seriously considered.' Reagan justified the raids as pre-emptive self-defense against imminent terrorist attacks. Reagan cited a state’s

The requisite public condemnations were made, but in private there was a surprising amount of support for the attack. There was no widespread anti-American backlash and Qaddafi did not become an Arab hero. Indeed, his isolation from the rest of the Arab world was made painfully obvious.®* Qaddafi received more support from the non-Arabic Third World states. In the United Nations Security Council, Great Britain, France, and the U.S. vetoed a resolution denouncing the American strike. However, the General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the raid, albeit with a high abstention rate. But Qaddafi apparently did not receive much more than words o f support. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) refused a Libya request for an oil embargo against the United States, instead opting for a condemnation.®® The Western Europeans were highly critical of the raid. Although most of the governments tended to be reserved in their criticisms, their populations often were not. Many people were horrified by the bombing, believing it would have little positive effect and would goad more retaliatory terrorist acts. The more vitriolic opponents questioned its morality and legality.*”  Ironically, the raid 343  File: --- klubes_compellence.pdf --- Page 356 --- galvanized the Europeans into action against Libya, partially due to an acknowledgement of the problem and partially in an attempt to forestall further American military actions.®' Although they still rejected significant economic sanctions, political and diplomatic sanctions were soon enacted, the most prominent being the expulsion of hundreds o f Libyan diplomats from Europe.*® At their summit in May 1986, the G-7 countries decided not to export arms to any state that sponsored terrorism, reduce the diplomatic missions of states that sponsored terrorism and took measures to improve cooperation between the G-7 state’s intelligence, securit

But more relevantly, Nixon and Kissinger were optimistic that the Soviets, and to a lesser extent China, could play an important role in bringing North Vietnam to a settlement. The first breakthrough was with China. China was probably most interested in finding a counter-balance to the Soviet Union and becoming an influential player in the world diplomatic scene. Tentative feelers were sent out by both sides soon after Nixon was elected.®^ However, due to the glacial pace of such intricate and subtle diplomacy, the dramatic visits to China by Kissinger and Nixon did not occur until 1971 and 1972 respectively.™ This dramatic turn surprised and upset the Soviets, who then pushed harder for detente.

Often, he attempted to steer a mid-course to no one’s satisfaction and to the detriment of the military situation. Notwithstanding his Secretary of Defense’s pessimism toward the bombing and the war in general, in November 1966 President Johnson decided to escalate Rolling Thunder slightly. The Joint Chiefs of Staff had recently renewed their efforts to broaden the bombing campaign into an economic infrastructure strategy. They contended that a full adoption of this strategy would decimate North Vietnam’s capability and will to fight.” ®  In November, Johnson authorized a target selection package that included power plants, a cement plant, and more transportation, POL, and military facilities within the restricted area around Hanoi and Haiphong.”®  Johnson had decided to get tough with North Vietnam, but it was not a complete shift in strategy from interdiction. Instead, it was more of a gradually applied economic infrastructure strategy. Before the strikes could be totally carried out, diplomacy intervened. The last vestige of the Marigold initiative was still ongoing. The bombing raids in early December coincided with a visit by the Polish diplomats to Hanoi and Saigon. Although the Poles informed the Americans of Hanoi’s belief that the bombings were a provocation that could jeopardize the talks, the U.S. continued the strikes for over two weeks. Even though Johnson eventually curtailed Rolling Thunder in the Hanoi and Haiphong vicinities in hopes of maintaining the contact, North Vietnam used the bombing as a pretext to finally end this diplomatic endeavor.

He successfully played upon the perception that America was growing weaker under President Jimmy Carter. Along with the Soviet Union, the new administration made terrorism a high priority.
