He returned to it time and again in the course of the debate. Nonetheless, Churchill had fixed his policy: We should, of course, continue to give the Americans every encouragement and help in the experiment which they ardently and obstinately wish to make, but we ought to try to persuade them to give as much aid as possible (a) to sea work and (b) to night bombing, and to revise their production, including instru- ments and training for the sake of these objects.18 Churchill's persistence in recommending antisubmarine work reflected the uncertain status of the Battle of the Atlantic in late 1942. The British were losing merchant shipping faster than they could replace it. British import tonnage, the life's blood of an economy not blessed with overwhelming native supplies of raw materials and agricultural resources, had fallen from a prewar annual aver- age of 50 million tons to 23 million tons in 1942. Even the most stringent ship- ping measures could not close the gap between imports and domestic require- ments, which forced the British to consume internal stocks, reducing them to the minimum needed to support the British war effort. In early November, the British came hat in hand to Washington to plead for an additional 7 million tons of U.S.-built shipping, a request Roosevelt granted without even consulting mili- tary leaders.19 But it would take months for American yards to deliver the ships. In the meantime, Churchill felt that a diversion of the U.S. bombing effort to sea work would pay greater dividends in saved shipping, while a reduction in U.S. forces stationed in Britain would conserve tonnage. * The British reduced this resentment to a single phrase: The Yanks were “overpaid, oversexed and over here!" At the end of August 1942, Eighth Air Force personnel in Britain numbered approxi- mately 30,000. By the end of November

I can remember being there at two o'clock in the morning, rushing over to General Spaatz's house; General Anderson came out in his bathrobe, and General Spaatz served us tea. During a big night we were up all night in some cases.116 Living and working together fit in with Spaatz's philosophy of leadership. Spaatz once said of himself, "I may be peculiar in that I refuse to be seated at a desk with a bunch of papers in front of me to pore over."117 In the same context Spaatz philosophized, "I doubt you can run any big outfit... immersed in all the details... so you must delegate responsibility." He went on, "It has always been a fetish of mine that you can't delegate responsibility without delegating author- ity with it."118 A long-time friend also spoke of Spaatz's attitude toward routine: Tooey, like some literary characters, was inclined to get up very late and work very late. He was a night worker more than a day worker. So actually [he did] much of [his] work in pajamas in a messed up bedroom at 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning. That's just the way he worked; I'm not disparaging him. He was firmly in command. . . . The last thing in the world he wanted was an 8 o'clock officers' call someplace with everybody sitting down at desks pushing papers around. He just didn't want to be bothered with administration or minor mat- ters. He refused to be.119 Spaatz ran a military household that had much more in common with the staffs of Lee and Napoleon than the German General Staff. By keeping his senior officers close at hand, messing, drinking, and even gaming with them, he established a firm and deep rapport with his subo

Brereton may well have been "kicked upstairs”—at least, Bradley thought so.79 He said of Brereton, "Ike knew Brereton was not pulling his weight. I had told Ike he was hard to do business with. Brereton never seemed interested in the job, would never throw himself into it."80 Brereton had committed two of the worst sins possible for an air commander with a ground support mission. He had not established a good working relationship with nor set up his headquarters directly alongside his counterpart in the ground forces. Apparently, after he set up his own plush headquarters in Normandy, he hardly ever went to see Bradley in the field, only a mile away.81 Unlike Coningham, who also had a less-than- exemplary relationship with his counterpart in the ground forces, Brereton had neither the patina of past success nor the support of his superiors in the air chain of command. His aspirations for independence and his support of the transporta- tion plan had probably irritated Spaatz. In the somewhat feudal and definitely hierarchical nature of the military establishment there was no indication that Brereton was a “Spaatz man.” Conversely, Vandenberg had formed strong ties to the Arnold-Spaatz section of the Army Air Forces. As the American generals sorted out their new positions, the British air mar- shals engaged in a brouhaha of their own, revolving around their respective views of Montgomery. Coningham was still hostile toward him, Tedder, as discussed earlier, had taken up the warpath against him for his supposed lack of vigor and success and had continued the campaign for his relief. Leigh-Mallory, marching to his own drum, had alienated Portal, Tedder, and SHAEF Headquarters staff by literally moving in with Montgomery. In his Command Diary, on July 19, Tedder noted: Montgomery will not deal with Coningham, but only with L-M [Leigh- Mallory].

In addition, the source materials for several of the work's chapters seem to have been scattered or broken up, so it is difficult to identify and locate key documents used by the original authors. Despite quibbles about a few judgments and statistics, Craven and Cate nevertheless remains the authoritative history of the AAF during the war.

By the end of March 1941, Marshall initiated new studies that resulted in the final prewar air organi- zation.68 On June 20, 1941, the War Department issued a revised edition of Army Regulation 95-5, which governed the status, function, and organization of the air arm. It created the Army Air Forces (AAF) headed by a chief, who also became the Deputy Chief of Staff for Air and had the authority to supervise and coordi- nate the work of the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps, the GHQ Air Force (redesignated Air Force Combat Command), and all other air elements. The reg- ulation further created an Air Staff to assist the new deputy chief, which freed the air arm from much of the dominance formerly exercised over it by the ground officers who controlled the War Department General Staff. At Arnold's behest, Spaatz became the first Chief of the Air Staff at the end of June 1941. This organization sufficed until March 9, 1942, when a final rearrangement of positions gave the Army Air Forces equality with the Army Ground Forces and greatly reduced the power of the General Staff.69 In another War Department organizational move, in December 1940, Robert A. Lovett became Special Assistant to the Secretary of War on all air matters. The following spring Lovett advanced to the post of Assistant Secretary of War for Air, a position left vacant by the Roosevelt administration since 1933. Lovett would prove a powerful, friendly, and effective civilian advocate for the AAF. Negotiations

As one would expect, retirements were concentrated in the years after 1928 (70 of 72), as senior officers who joined the service at the time of the Spanish-American War and later reached retirement age departed. Resignations peaked in 1930, with 27, as the junior officers resigned to join the newly established commercial airlines, and trailed off drastically during the Depression; only 16 regular officers resigned from 1931 to 1935.

Sherry offers good research and stimulating writing in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to apply anti-Vietnam War morality to American bombing in World War II. Both books make a stronger case for the immorality of bombing Japan than Germany, focusing on the AAF's massive fire raid on Tokyo and on the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The current social trends rejecting nuclear war and open racism, one unheard of and the other not questioned in the 1940s, make the war against Japan a hot topic of modern research. The atrocities and racism of the Japanese regime are dismissed as cultural differences. Such a case cannot be made for the Germans. They belonged to the mainstream of Western culture, were Caucasian to a fault, and committed atrocities on a numbing scale. 757   ## p. 758 (#782) ############################################  SPAATZ AND THE AIR WAR IN EUROPE Unpublished Material Cabell, C.P.

He noted that although he had always insisted that USSTAF bomb precision targets he was "always prepared to take part in anything that gives real promise to ending the war quickly." Eisenhower promised Spaatz, "The policies under which you are now operating will be unchanged unless in my opinion an opportunity arises where a sudden and devastating blow may have an incalculable result."66 Spaatz expressed stronger views to Arnold, who, unlike Eisenhower, did not require his subordinates to eschew inter-Allied bickering: I have been subjected to some pressure on the part of the Air Ministry to join hands with them in morale bombing.

Montgomery, General Officer Commanding, 21 Army Group, Northwest Europe, 1944-1945. Imperial War Mueum My immediate problem was to place on a more solid footing the arrangements for control of our Air Forces. Leigh-Mallory, though earnest, zealous, and brave, did not inspire confidence as Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Air Forces. It seemed to me that he was insufficiently firm in explaining to the Army authorities the limitations of air-power in direct support of the ground battle.83 Montgomery meanwhile had developed a greater appreciation for Leigh- Mallory's qualities. He wrote to a friend at the War Office in London, “We must definitely keep Leigh-Mallory as Air Commander-in-Chief. He is the only air- man who is out to help us with the land battle and has no jealous reactions."84 In the eyes of most of the top Allied airmen, Montgomery's support could only have been the kiss of death. At this point Tedder decided to eliminate or greatly reduce Headquarters, AEAF. He had already removed CROSSBOW from AEAF's purview and had informed Leigh-Mallory that if he, Leigh-Mallory, wished to move forward to direct the tactical battle at the expense of Coningham, then he, Tedder, would resume total direction of the strategic air forces. "I could not help feeling," wrote Tedder in
