The performance of the German heavy twin-engine fighter, the Bf 110, against the nimble, shorter-range, lighter British single-engine Hurricanes and Spitfires, confirmed this conviction. Spaatz also observed from German operations that close fighter escort, in any case, did "not insure immunity from attack by hostile fighters on the bombers. A comparatively fewer number of hostile fighters can, by determined effort, break up the large [bomber] formation."64 After talking to RAF bomber pilots Spaatz also reaffirmed his belief in the necessity of daylight precision bombing for accurate results and in the defensive strength of large, heavy-bomber formations. Explaining away the apparent con- tradiction between the assumption that determined fighter attack would break up bomber formations and the assumption that a well-flown bomber formation could defend itself, he observed that so far the Germans had not demonstrated the ability to mount a determined attack on British bombers. Spaatz apparently had not fully realized that the British had switched to night operations because of excessive casualties suffered in daylight operations. These beliefs, typical of those of many Air Corps leaders, would be modified only by costly direct actions with "determined" German fighter planes in 1943. But, as already noted, Spaatz had seen the ineffectiveness of the close escort tactics the Germans employed to protect their bombers. In close escort German fighters stayed with the bombers until British fighters attacked, at which time the escorts tried to break up the intercepting fighters' assault. This tactic had proved ineffective. It robbed the German fighters of their aggressiveness by forcing them to react to British attacks instead of launching their own.

The shortage of fighters to apply against its opponent was as much a function of the Luftwaffe's own inefficiency as it was of the heavy losses inflicted by the Americans. Ever larger numbers of American long-range escorts succeeded in wrecking the combined interceptor tactics the Germans had developed to combat deep- bomber penetrations. Before February 1944, the Germans almost always waited to attack until the escort had left the bombers to return home, which happened on any deep-penetration raid in 1943. Waiting to attack until the escort left allowed for basing deep within Germany, and for defensive aircraft to be con- centrated after the bombers had committed to a specific route and probable des- tination. Fighters could concentrate without being attacked. During the Schweinfurt missions and later, German twin-engine fighters had stayed beyond range of the bombers' defensive armament and shelled them with 210mm rock- ets, adapted from the German rocket mortar and known by the ground troops as the "screaming meemie." When the bombers loosened their positions to avoid rocket explosions, the single-engine fighters would attack the attenuated forma- tion. In the face of vigorous escorts this tactic did not work. Not only were con- centration areas liable to attack, so were home airfields. The performance of the American single-engine fighter escorts so outclassed that of the twin-engine German heavy fighters as to make the latter virtually helpless.

Before Spaatz could field all the bombers on hand, he had to finish training their crews, all of which arrived unready for combat. Weather played a far larger role than Arnold would acknowledge. An authoritative postwar study of weather as it affected heavy-bomber missions stated that weather reduced "the potential effort planned on a monthly basis by 45 percent."111 This figure included the summer months, which, of course, contained the best flying weather. Spaatz and Eaker, however, were encouraged by their progress. In a series of memos written for internal AAF use, Eaker gave his and Spaatz's views. After the first four missions, he confidently stated his conviction that "in the future, successful bombing missions can be conducted beyond the range of fighter pro- tection."112 Six weeks later, after suffering his initial losses from German fight- ers, Eaker reiterated his beliefs: Our bombing experience to date indicates that the B-17 with its twelve .50 cal- iber guns, can cope with the German day fighter. There will be losses, of course, but there is no evidence that the losses will be of such a high order as to make day bombing uneconomical. I think it is safe, now, to say that a large force of day bombers can operate without fighter cover against material objec- tives anywhere in Germany, without excessive losses. Such losses as did occur could be much reduced, Eaker thought, with the provision of a B-17 type convoy defender aircraft, already existing in prototype, “with extra ammunition supply and extra armor, flying on the flanks of the bomber formations." He requested the shipment of a group or squadron of such planes as soon as possible.113 Eaker seems not to have yet accepted the technical feasibility of a long-range escort fighter.

The P-38s, which had an ineffective day, claimed three kills and one damaged. The P-51s, which defended the bombers over the target and during deep stretches when desperate Luftwaffe pilots could no longer wait for them to depart and had to attack before they themselves ran out of fuel, claimed fourty-three destroyed, one probable, and twenty damaged. One hundred P-51s bore the brunt of the battle and, in losing only five of their number, achieved an 8-to-1 kill ratio.114 The claims of the American fighters were many times more accurate than those of the bombers.

Spaatz's plan of December 1938 had called for an increase in annual military pilot training from 300 to 4,500 pilots. In the spring of 1939 the Air Corps had adopted a planning goal of 24 combat-ready groups—that is, fully equipped, completely trained, and capa- ble of fulfilling their assigned missions by June 30, 1941. But the May 16 expansion raised these goals to 7,000 pilots per year and 41 groups. Barely 2 months later, on August 8, newer plans called for 12,000 pilots and 54 combat- ready groups. The August 8 plans also called for 21,470 planes and a total of 119,000 personnel, almost 6 times the personnel envisaged in the summer of 1939. These were the changes Spaatz found when he resumed his post as Chief of the Plans Division (upgraded from a section in May 1940), Headquarters, Air Corps, in November 1940.

Likewise, Bomber Command had committed itself, despite limited circus operations, to the strategic bombing of Germany at night. Night operations depended on avoiding and deceiving the enemy's defenses, not fighting through them, which would have required escort aircraft. Bomber Command, too, had little operational need for escort aircraft. Given the per- ceived lack of need and the limited resources available, the RAF's refusal to invest in escort aircraft and its failure to pursue technical solutions to fighter range extension were understandable. In fact, the RAF never developed or employed substantial numbers of long-range fighter escort aircraft during the war.

These forces already labored under the self- imposed handicaps of faulty organization and incompetent higher leadership. From October 1943 through March 1944, Goering, Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe, attempted to cope with the deteriorating air situation by strictly enforcing a policy of ignoring the fighter escort and attacking the heavy bombers.96 Maj. Gen. Adolph Galland, who commanded the Luftwaffe day- fighter force, protested vociferously against this directive, claiming that it unnecessarily handcuffed his pilots. German pilots under orders to avoid American fighters were put on the defensive and robbed of the aggressiveness needed for successful fighter-to-fighter combat.97 Other German wartime critics advocated attacking the escorts at the earliest possible point to force them to jettison their drop tanks and reduce their range.98 This apparently simple stratagem demonstrated the depth of the German defen- sive problem. The Luftwaffe did not base substantial numbers of fighters in France for three reasons: they would be vulnerable to harassing raids from medium bombers and fighter-bombers, their bases would require additional manpower for heavy antiaircraft defenses and for ground defense against parti- sans, and their supply dumps would stretch logistical links as well as offer tar- gets to air r

Seventy miles east of the Dutch-German border, at the practical P-47 range limit, the B-17s of the 3d Bombardment Division grouped in a sixty-mile-long column of combat wing pairs and ran smack into the middle of a concentration of perhaps 150 German single-engine fighters. The small number of P-38s oper- ationally available for that leg of the relay left the bombers underescorted. German ground controllers, having detected an escort gap in the center of the column, sent small forces to the head and tail of the U.S. force to distract and pin the escort, and then threw the remaining 100 fighters at the momentarily unprotected center. In less than thirty minutes the aggressive German attack downed perhaps twenty bombers of the 3d Bombardment Division. The attack singled out the 100th Bombardment Group.

Barney Giles reported the tactical changes to the Air Staff, noting that Doolittle had instructed his fighters "to attack enemy fighter formations even though such formations are not pressing attacks on bomber formations."70 Doolittle's order freed the long-range escort fighters from the restrictions of close escort heretofore applied. Before that time, standard procedure had tied U.S. fighters to bomber formations, which they were forbidden to desert to pursue German fighters.71 Prewar and early wartime field manuals had reinforced the use of close escort. FM 1-5, "Employment of Aviation of the Army," in both its April 1940 and January 1943 incarnations, stated, A pursuit force may be employed to furnish close or immediate protection for a particular formation engaged in an important air operation. The only method by which pursuit forces are able to provide close protection for aircraft in flight is by accompanying those aircraft and by engaging any and all enemy aircraft which threaten the security of the formation.72 Here the use of the word "engaging" rather than "attacking" seems to imply sur- render of the initiative to the enemy's fighters. The manuals went on to state that the need for close support depended on the effectiveness of the enemy fighter forces and was required when the defensive fire power of the escorted aircraft was inadequate. Somewhat ambiguously the manuals noted, “All aircraft in flight possess a measure of inherent security, and most aircraft possess consider- able defensive power."73 That clause limited provision of close escort to essen- tial missions against developed air defenses.

Also like Grant, Spaatz benefited through the prodi- gal output of men and material from an industrial economy whose production was overwhelming. The pipeline that had supplied Eaker with only a slowly increasing force overflowed in late 1943 and early 1944 for Spaatz. The Allied victory in the Battle of the Atlantic and massive U.S. merchant shipping production turned the constricted flow of supplies that had slowed the U.S. buildup in Britain for the first one and a half years of the war into a fast-flowing river. As a consequence of delays caused, in part, by a January 1943 decision by Arnold and Spaatz to divert P-38s to the North African Theater, Eaker's first operational P-38 "Lightning" long-range fighter group (the 55th) of approximately seventy-five aircraft became operational the day after the Schweinfurt mission. The P-38s of the 20th Fighter Group went into action in December 1943, as did the first long- range P-51B Mustang fighters (the Ninth Air Force's 354th Fighter Group). In March the P-51 began to use new external fuel tanks (drop tanks), which en- abled it to go as far as any bombers in the theater. 10 As of December 30, 1943, the Army Air Forces in England comprised 4,618 * A loss rate of 3.8 percent per mission meant that 3.8 percent of the original force was lost on each mission. By the end of 25 missions the cumulative loss suffered by the original 100 air crews was therefore 64 air crews, even though only 3.8 percent, on average, were lost in a single mission. Reinforcement of the original 100 crews would have no effect on their chances for statistical sur- vival because new arrivals would be lost at the same rate. 288   ## p. 289 (#313) ############################################   us Lt.

The Germans could adopt such a policy because the limited range of the RAF escorts did not allow bombing of targets vital to the German war effort.91 Circus operations reinforced the prevailing RAF opin- ion that short-range fighter aircraft could not provide strategic escort. In May 1941, shortly before launching the operation, the Chief of the Air Staff and a former head of Bomber Command, Air Chief Marshal Portal, had replied to a query from Churchill on fighter escorts by noting, "Increased range can only be provided at the expense of performance and maneuverability." He added, “The long-range fighter, whether built specifically as such, or whether given increased range by fitting extra tanks, will be at a disadvantage compared with the short-range high-performance fighter."92 On September 28, Portal 62   ## p. 63 (#87) ##############################################  PREWAR PLANNING expressed similar views to Eaker, drawing the logical conclusion "that the proper escort fighter will be a ship exactly like the bomber it is going to escort." This heavily armored and armed aircraft would take station at weak points in the bomber formation and by "expel[ling] heavy caliber fire in all directions,” make it "very difficult for the light single seater fighters."93 The commander of the RAF Test, Research, and Experimental Unit spoke to Eaker of the impossibility of the large fighter getting through a screen of small fighters, saying, “They will sting it to death."94 The organization and design of the RAF contributed to its inability to con- ceive of aircraft combining bomber range and fighter performance. The raison d'etre of Fighter Command was the air defense of Britain. Its planes, especially the superb Spitfire series, had been designed and built for that purpose alone. Therefore, they emphasized performance over endurance, which was not needed for defense of English ai

Events proved the Americans and British correct in their assumption that no heavy fighter could successfully perform long-range escort in Europe. The P-38, an American twin-engine fighter, had its greatest impact in the Pacific against a very different foe. The P-38, because of its higher operating altitude and faster diving speed, a factor of its greater weight, was not helpless against German air- craft; it just operated at a disadvantage in a melee because of its relative lack of maneuverability, especially when opposing pilots were of equal ability. The P-38 performed better than the Bf 110 in the strategic escort role, but as soon as suffi- cient numbers of long-range single-engine fighters became available, the AAF hastened to replace it. Ironically, the aircraft that proved the ultimate solution to the long-range escort problem, the P-51 (Mustang), had its maiden flight in October 1940, a year before the pursuit board met. The Mustang was the direct result of a con- tract between the British government and the North American Aviation Corporation. The contract, signed in January 1940, specified completion within 120 days of a prototype single-engine fighter aircraft. Within 117 days, North American rolled out the plane, complete except for its engine. The design incorporated lessons learned from the early days of the war and included simple lines, for ease of pro- duction; an in-line water-cooled engine, frowned upon by the AAF because of its vulnerability to damage compared with a radial air-cooled engine; and an a

It robbed the German fighters of their aggressiveness by forcing them to react to British attacks instead of launching their own. In con- trast, distant escort freed the fighters to leave the slow-moving bomber forma- tions and to attack enemy fighters when they made their appearance. This obser- vation may have helped Spaatz reach his brilliant wartime decision, in January 1944, to free the Eighth Air Force's fighters from the bombers by authorizing them to search out and destroy enemy fighters. At the same time, Spaatz dis- carded one of the tenets of prewar air thinking—that air bombardment could shatter a civilian population's willingness to resist. Spaatz left Britain convinced that the morale of the British and probably that of the German civil populations would not collapse in the face of bombardment. Spaatz's stay in Britain also exposed him to technical innovations, such as 53   ## p. 54 (#78) ##############################################   KA KAR KA M KAK The Battle of Britain.
