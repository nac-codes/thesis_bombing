In the interim, World War II had started. After bluffing England and France out of the Rhineland, Austria and Czecho- slovakia, Hitler invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, but this time England and France called his bluff. The Americans on the other hand had something else in mind. Three fissionable isotopes were identified: U-235, Pu- 239 and U-233. To obtain usable quantities of U-235 was te- dious and we were studying various methods - gaseous diffu- sion, electromagnetic separation and thermal diffusion. The two most promising methods were gaseous diffusion and elec- tromagnetic separation but these enrichment processes were slow, however, gaseous diffusion remains the dominant method to this day. On the other hand, if one could use the neutrons in a pile, one could obtain fairly large quantities of Pu-239 through the reaction of Uranium-238 capturing a neutron to produce Plu- tonium-239. The catch to this reaction was to separate Pu from uranium and all the fission byproducts. Since the dawn of the nuclear age in 1898 and Madame Curie's identification of ra- dium in 1903, only about 2000 curies or grams of radium had been isolated. Accompanying this separation had been many deaths due to radium poisoning but the fission byproducts from a Pu production reactor were estimated to be in the range of millions of curies - this was the problem.

A modest grant was provided and nuclear physics re- search picked up at Columbia University, Princeton Univer- sity, University of Chicago and University of California at Berkeley. Nothing dramatic happened until Pearl Harbor and we were involved in a two front war. Nuclear research led to the establishment of some salient facts that had only been speculation previously. First, fission occurred in natural uranium in several isotopes. Uranium- 235 fissioned with fast and thermal neutrons. Uranium-238 fissions with fast neutrons only. Plutonium-239, a man made isotope, also fissioned with fast and thermal neutrons. Most dramatically, fission itself is a self sustaining reaction since one - two neutrons are released per fission. By controlling The availability of fissionable material drove the sched- ule for the delivery of the ordnance. In March 44, when Gen. Groves met with Gen.

I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations. Sir: In the course of the last four months it has been made probable- through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in America-that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of power and large quan- tities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future. This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable-though much less certain-that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air. The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the former Czechoslo vakia, while the most important source of uranium is the Belgian Congo In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America. One possible way of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person who has your confidence who could perhaps serve in an unofficial capacity. His task might comprise the following: a) to approach Government Departments, p them imformed of ations for Govern- the further development, and put forward recomn ment action, giving particular attention to the problems of securing a sup- ply of uranium ore for the United States. t present being car- b) to speed up the experimental work, which is a ried on within the limits of budgets of

Admiral Suzuki's cabinet fell on 16 August 1945 but issued a proclamation before the fall stating: "Imperial judgment has been passed. The way for His Majesty's subjects to follow is self evident ... and there is "no way" for Japan to realize her "ob- jective in the war" with the use of the new bomb which has destructive power unprecedented in his- tory. Science has brought a change in the method of warfare, moreover, the Soviet Union on 9 Au- gust 1944 declared war on Japan and Japan has come to face unprecedented difficult situation. ... Japan must develop its fortunes in the fu- ture through its endurance. The way for people to proceed is in guarding the national polity." Neither statement mentioned surrender or defeat. Both emphasized the power of the atom bomb against which they were powerless. Finally, they emphasized the need for the Japa- nese people to now come together for the common good and rebuild the nation. This call was resoundingly taken up by the Japanese people who now have one of the strongest econo- mies in the world, and that with few inherent natural resources. 3.

Evacuate your cities now!" As early as the spring of 1944, a group of former Prime Ministers and others close to the Emperor were making efforts to end the war. This group included Adm. Okada, Adm. Yonai, Prince Konoye, Marshal Kido, these men influenced Tojo's fall and made Adm. Suzuki Prime Minister after Koiso's fall fol- lowing Okinawa invasion on 1 April 1945. But even in Prime Minister Suzuki's cabinet, consensus on capitulation could not be reached. The navy minister, Adm. Yonai, was sympathetic but the war minister, Gen. Anami represented the army's "fight to the end" policy. Leaflets were dropped on Nagasaki indicating that it was to be bombed and copies of this leaflet are on display in the Nagasaki Peace Museum. There is some doubt as to whether the Nagasaki leaflet was dropped before the detonation of the bomb at 1102 Nagasaki time on 9 August 1945. The Nagasaki strike was originally scheduled for 11 August 1945 but it was moved up to 9 August 1945 due to predicted poor weather over Japan on 10 August. It is possible that the leaflets were dropped later in the day on 9 August or on subsequent days.

Some believed, for example, it was because there were so many Chris- tians. Many Japanese Americans came from Hiroshima; the city was a famous beauty spot; others, however, felt that their city was being saved for "something big". The final surge for peace began on the 26th of June, 1945 at the Imperial Conference with the Emperor. He took an ac- tive part and stated his desire to develop a plan to end the war as well as one to defend the home islands. This effort led to renewed efforts to involve the Soviet Union to intercede with the U.S. for peace. These efforts led to the Potsdam Declara- tion issued on 26 July 45. Russia declared war on 9 August 45. The atomic bomb permitted the army to state that no army without the weapon could possibly resist an enemy who had it, thus saving "face" for the army. In the Supreme War Council, voting still remained divided with Gen. Anami and the two Chiefs of Staff unwill ing to accept unconditional surrender. Studies showed that "the will to resist" was higher prior to 1 July 1945 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki than in other areas of Japan. Almost 40% testified to varying degrees of defeatism induced by the atom bomb. As a result of the atom bomb, 20% of those interviewed stated they hated the Americans for using the bomb. For Japan as a whole, the feelings were similar but less intense. Fear and terror, anger and hatred against the us- ers, admiration for the scientific achievement, these were some of the feelings of the Japanese people. The peace effort culminated in an Imperial Conference on the night of 9 August 1945 and continued into the early hours of 10 August 1945 for which the stage was set by the second atomic bombing and the Russian declaration of war.

In the Supreme War Guidance Council, a sort of inner cabinet, Gen. Anami's position was supported by the army and navy chiefs of staff who were represented on the Council. This body, therefore, was evenly divided with Gen. Anami, Gen. Umezu, Army chief of Staff and Adm. Toyoda, Navy Chief of Staff wanting to continue the war and Adm. Suzuki Prime Minister, Mr. Togo Foreign Minister and Adm. Yonai, Navy Minister for ending the war. At any time the military, especially the army, could bring down the government and possibly liquidate the antiwar members. The problem thus was to surrender despite the opposition of the three military members. How this was done without violent reaction from the army was to involve the Emperor. Since the military had fostered and lived on the idea that the Emperor was divine and required obedience, they could not effectively rebel if the Emperor wanted to surrender. For the inhabitants of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the prin- ciple reaction to the bomb was fear, uncontrolled terror, strengthened by the sheer horror of destruction and suffering witnessed and experienced by the survivors. Two typical reac- tions were: "aimless, even hysterical activity or flight from city to shelter and food". The effect of the atomic bomb on the inhabitant of Hiroshima and Nagasaki arose not only from its enormous power but also from the total surprise of the attack. The weather plane flights over both cities had the unintended effect of caus- ing lax air raid precaution procedures when the actual strike aircraft were over the target.

In Nagasaki, only the Mitsubishi Dockyards were remote enough to escape serious damage. The other three Mitsubishi plants were seriously damaged. The arms plant was 58% destroyed and the steel works 78% destroyed by estimates by plant management. The USSBS estimates the two plants to be 50% destroyed, Mitsubishi Electric Works suffered 10% structural damage. In general, as with the HE and IB raids, damage to machines was less than damage to buildings. Short- ages of raw materials had reduced operations at these four Mitsubishi plants to a fraction of their capacity. If the raw material situation was normal and the war continued, it was estimated that restoration of production would have been pos- sible but slow. The steel works would have required one year to get back into substantial production; the electric works would have resumed production at a reduced rate in two months and been back at capacity in 6 months and the arms plant would have required 15 months to reach 67% of former capacity. The USSBS concluded that the most striking effect of the atomic bomb was the great number of casualties. The exact number will never be known due to confusion after the blast. Because of decline in activity in the two port cities, constant threat of the incendiary raids and formal evacuation program of the gov- ernment; an unknown number of inhabitants had either drifted away from the cities or had been removed according to plan. USSBS estimates that the casualties were distributed as follows: After the Hiroshima atomic bombing, an intensified pro- paganda campaign was launched.

I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over. That she should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizaecker, is attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the Ameri- can work on uranium is now being repeated.

There was suddenly a need for tons of uranium which were not readily available. The three major sources available to the U.S. were Canada's Great Bear Lake, Belgium Congo and the carnotite deposits in the American west. Relative to the other two deposits the carnotite ore was of very low grade. Through an intercession with the Belgian govern- ment, the U.S. government was able to obtain 3000 tons of Belgian Congo ore which had been shipped to Staten Island, NY prior to the war for safe keeping. These deposits and the reopening of the mine at Great Bear Lake met the immediate needs of the Manhattan Project. Many physicists who had fled Germany had great fears that this type of ordnance would fall into Hitler's hands. As recounted in Rhodes (5), Einstein, Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller met in the summer of 1939 and decided on a course of action. An immediate concern was to secure a source of the rare element, uranium. They were aware that Hitler had closed off the export of uranium from the St. Joachimsthal mine nium supply from the Be Fermi calculated that he could build a self-sustaining chain reaction with a pile of natural uranium embedded in blocks of graphite. This is about as far as the Germans got, although they took a slightly different route by employing a sphere of natural uranium in heavy water. Heavy water contains Hydro- gen-2 rather than Hydrogen-1 as in ordinary water and conse- quently is less poisonous to a self-sustaining reaction. The Germans had in mind a nuclear heat source to power a ship, possibly a submarine. in Czechoslovakia. They wanted, at least, to secure the ura- he Belgian Congo (now Zaire or Congo). Initially, Einstein was going to approach Queen Elizabeth of Belgium whom he knew, but they believed that the energy po- tential from nuclear fission must be first brought to the atten- tion of the U.S. government.

Each B-29 carried a maximum load of 7 tons, it would require a force of 300 B-29s for Hiroshima and 1 and 171 B-29s for Nagasaki to effect comparable damage. The 22,200 tons HE equivalent of the Nagasaki bomb was not as effectively distributed as it might have been if the area was flatter. Of course, no conven- tional B-29 raid could produce the ionizing radiation effects which Hiroshima and Nagasaki experienced and has excited the world ever since. Contribution to Ending WWII 104 Conventional wisdom is that the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were directly responsible for Japan's surrender. As we now know, and persons reading the "magic intercepts", the atomic bombings were only one factor. The Japa- nese were slowly moving through the normal consensus building process leading to Japan's eventual surrender. It was a traumatic decision for Japan. Many in Japan believed that the Emperor was divine and to die for him and the country was a glorious deed. One Kamekazi pilot's wife and family killed themselves so that he would be eligible for a Kamekazi mission. Such fa- naticism is what the US military was concerned about in their preparations for the invasion of Kyushu - Operation Olympic. Also, Japan had the tradition of never being defeated. In the consensus building process, the fire raids, atomic bombings, star- vation and Russia's entry into the war and what that would mean in the occupation of Japan, convinced Emperor Hirohito to step into the deliberations and accept the unconditional surrender terms as stated in the Potsdam Declaration. His acceptance was broad- cast to the Japanese people at 12 noon, 15 August 1945. He stated: lization of East Asia, it being far from Our thought either to infringe upon the sovereignty of other na- tions or to embark on territorial aggrandizement. But now the war has lasted for nearly four years. De- spite the best that has been done by everyone - the gallant fighting of military an
