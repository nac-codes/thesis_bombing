The tail gunner kept firing and the Jack disintegrated but rammed the left side of the tail gunner's compartment. The primary target was cloud cov- ered and 56 planes hit Tokyo urban area and six targets of opportunity (TO). Since the initial target was cloud covered, this necessitated two bomb runs and the total time of the for- mations for the two bomb runs totaled over two hours giving Japanese defenses a field day.

One must remember, that following the Okinawa conquest, the Kyushu invasion was scheduled for November 1945 and Honshu invasion scheduled for March 1946. If the strategic bombing of Japan was to win the war, there was need for a drastic change in tactics. Precision daylight bombing in formation was not placing sufficient bombs on target to defeat or even impress anyone, least of all the Japanese. To achieve the merging of fires caused by incendiary bomb patterns laid down by an individual plane requires a continu- ous stream of airplanes. To orchestrate these fire raids required a considerable amount of staff work. Otherwise the individual fires caused by individual planes could be isolated and extin- guished by local fire brigades. For the Tokyo fire raid of 9/10 March 1945, 325 B-29s from the 73rd, 313th and 314th BW were sent aloft, 279 bombed the primary target in Tokyo, 20 B-29s the sec

The wind was about 15 knots with waves six to ten feet high and 30 feet between the crests. The plane came in at 125 mph between the crests, the tail hit first and skidded 150 feet in the water before slamming down and breaking in two behind the radar section. The tail section floated for about one minute and the front section for about six minutes. The Bomber Command Missions No. 140 through 143 were run against Oita, Omura, Saeki and Matsuyama airfields.

The formation was met by 15 single en- gine Japanese fighters on their flight path, doubly unusual since it was quite rare to see a single engine Japanese fighter at that altitude, but by now the Japanese were well aware of the tar- get and had presumably a great deal of warning. The lead plane was hit and lost altitude and seven to eight crew mem- bers bailed out. Both colonels were captured; Col. Brugge died in captivity and Col. King was liberated at the end of the war. Another plane was destroyed leaving the target and four were missing. The toll on the B-29 engines flying in formation from Saipan to the edge of the Empire and then climbing to over 30,000 feet was very evident on this mission. Ten Japanese fighters were claimed, shot down by B-29 gunners, 13 B-29s were damaged. An unreported jet stream with 200 mile per hour winds was encountered at the bombing altitude. As de- scribed by Rust (8), another plane had an engine shot out with another engine losing oil and was being attacked by fighters. No other word was heard from this plane.

Another plane ditched on the trip up to the Empire. 9 January 1945 After trying their luck in an area incendiary attack against Nagoya (See Chapter II), the 73rd BW went back to precision daylight bombing in the Hansell mode on 9 January 1945 in Mission No. 18 attacking target 357 for the fifth time. This mission was a test of endurance and flying skills. The 1,500 mile trip up was in clouds and assembly point was also socked in making formation flying impossible and 18 diehards bombed Target No. 357 individually by radar resulting in slight dam- age to the engine plant. Thirty four planes bombed various targets of opportunity. Six planes were lost on this mission. Two planes were shot down over the target and four planes ditched with no survivors from any of the ditched planes. The need for Iwo was getting desperate. Twenty planes aborted on Mission No. 18. One dare not attempt the 3,000 mile round trip unless the plane was in perfect condition. To date three aircraft plants, the Nakajima Musashino air- craft engine plant, the Mitsubishi Nagoya engine plant and the Mitsubishi Nagoya airframe plant had been hit, but only the Mitsubishi Nagoya aircraft engine plant was seriously dam- aged.

First and foremost was the weather. Targets were visible from about 25,000 feet only a few days a month. Even with weather planes up every day predicting the weather over a target, six to eight hours later when the planes were over the target was proving unreliable. One thing that apparently was not forecast very reliably in advance was the 100 to 200 mile an hour jet stream coming out of Siberia over Japan. Rumors among some crews had the jet stream velocity as high as 600 miles an hour at times. This made accurate bombing with the Norden optical bombsight impossible. At this veloc- ity one could not go directly up wind, you would be a sitting duck, downwind you would be going too fast and the drift cor- rection going cross wind was difficult with such high wind velocities. The second difficulty was the wear and tear on the B-29, especially the engine, in the climb to over 25,000 feet. In the first Empire mission the 73rd BW got 111 planes in the air but they never went above 100 planes again until tactics were changed. 14 January 1945 Mission No. 19 took place five days later against the Mitsubishi Nagoya airframe plant. Through haze, 40 planes bombed the plant by radar but post strike photos showed that only three buildings were hit. As in past flights over Nagoya, fighter opposition was aggressive with 583 passes at the bomb- ers and 16 enemy planes claimed to be destroyed. Our losses were heavy as well with one plane ditching on the way to the target and three ditched on the return flight. Within the normal flight time of 14 to 16 hours, the bomber designated "Lassie Come Home" had not returned but after 19 hours she landed struggling all the way back on two engines.

On all these missions, attack altitude was from 5,700 to 8,875 feet which permitted bomb loads of between five to six tons per plane, a dramatic improvement over the tonnage pos- sible on daylight precision runs. 7 April 1945 The Musashino aircraft engine plant was hit in a classic daylight precision raid in formation with a fighter escort for the first time on 7 April 45. 90 P-51D's were escorted by a navigational B-29 (P-51 did not have navigational equipment for the long overwater flight from Iwo to the Empire) and ren- dezvoused with B-29s at Kozushima and escorted the forma- tions in. Coverage for the first several formations was fine but there was no fighter coverage for the later formations. Natu- rally, the fighters were thinking of their 700 mile journey back to Iwo Jima and could not linger over the target for later for- mations. This day the weather cooperated, it was CAVU (clear and visibility unlimited). The bomb load was changed to one ton bombs and damaged 48% of the plant. One hundred eleven B-29s were airborne and 101 bombed the primary target and two the secondary target. There was a stiff air battle over To- kyo and the 73rd BW lost six planes, three over the target: two to flak and one to air to air bombing, a rarity. Two P-51's were lost. There was a claim of 80 Japanese fighters for the B-29s and 21 by P-51's for a total of 101 Japanese fighters destroyed, 23 damaged and 50 probables by B-29s.

Phase Two: Precision Bombing LOSSES: 30 B-29s lost in transit to Saipan Gen. LeMay found that the training of the B-29 crews was lacking in gunnery and radar bombing and cruise control (es- sentially fuel management) and training missions were in- creased to hone these skills. The favorite target for training missions was the bypassed island of Truk, the former bastion of the Imperial Navy in the central Pacific. These flights pro- vided excellent experience in overwater gas consumption and cruise control and, depending upon the weather, good bomb- ing practice, either visually or by radar. Two additional wings were also coming to the Marianas. The air echelon of the 313th BW started to arrive at North Field, Tinian in January 1945 and entered combat over the Empire on 4 February 45. The 314th BW was stationed on North Field, Guam and entered combat over the Empire on 25 February 1945. The 313th BW was led by Gen. John H. Davies and the 314th BW by Gen. Thomas S. Power. The three BW's (73rd, 313th and 314th) would play the major role in bringing the Japanese to their knees by 15 August 1945. 13.5 B-29s lost due to Japanese raids on Saipan 90 B-29s lost (15 planes per raid x 6 raids/month) 133.5 B-29s lost/month total The attrition rate was approximately equal to their esti- mated production rate and therefore, according to the Japa- nese analysis, the raids will cease after the number that were stockpiled prior to the start of the B-29 campaign was used up. The B-29 losses for January 1945 were 27 B-29s for the XXI BC and four B-29s for the XX BC, not the 90 assumed in the Japanese analysis.

The 315th B-29 was specifically designed and coupled to the Eagle radar system. To increase bomb load, all armament was removed except for the 50 caliber machine guns in the tail. Removal included the two upper and the two lower tur- rets and three gunners, but this restricted operations to night raids. According to Gurelac (14), since the 315th BW was to do precision radar bombing, intelligence, training and briefing were done by the Wing and it did its own mission planning and prepared its own briefing material. 15/16 July 1945 Eagle Mission No. 7 on 15/16 July 1945 was a return visit to the Nippon Oil Company refinery at Kudamatsu previously attacked but missed the target on Eagle mission 2.

One hundred seventeen planes were airborne but the for- mations ran into clouds from 28 degree latitude north to the Honshu coast.

The USSBS (5) states that this was one of the most successful raids against the aircraft engine production of all the raids of the 20th Air Force resulting in the destruction of 2,200 machine tools which were damaged or destroyed and were irreplaceable by the Japanese at this stage of the war.

Tokyo Rose described the mission as follows: (4) "Enemy bombers appeared over Tokyo today in large groups of ten. They did not achieve great tangible bombing results because of effective interception by Japanese fighter planes. Upon interception the big bombers fled to the southern and northern outskirts of the city. Several enemy bombers were knocked down." 27 November 1944 In accordance with standard offensive doctrine - don't give the enemy a breather - 81 B-29s headed for the same target on 27 November 1944 but the weather was overcast and 49 planes hit the Tokyo dock and urban area by radar and 13 hit targets of opportunity. All together the planes dropped 114 tons GP and 64 tons IB, but none on Musashino. One plane ditched with all aboard lost. The Japanese were not taking the B-29 attacks against the Empire lightly. Normally, take-off for daylight missions was in the early hours after midnight. On 27 November 1944, two Betty bombers hit the 499th Bomb Group dispersal area on Saipan destroying one B-29 and, five minutes later, 17 Zekes strafed Isely Field and destroyed two more B-29s and severely damaged seven others. Most of the Zekes were shot down by fighters and antiaircraft fire. As described in (9), microwave early warning radar (MEW) was not initially installed on Saipan under the assumption that few Japanese planes could make the approximately 1,200 mile trip from Iwo Jima to Saipan and back, but suicide missions were now becoming standard mili- tary doctrine in Japan's increasingly desperate situation. 3 December 1944 Mission No. 10 was run against the same target #357 with 86 B-29s airborne and 60 bombing the target and eight others hitting the Tokyo dock and urban areas and 7 TO. This was a disastrous mission for the 73rd BW (4). Flying in the lead plane of a formation at 32,000 feet were Col. R. T. King, Com- mander of the 500th BG and Col. Byron E.

In a letter to his father, quoted in the New York Times, he stated: " ... a bit tired of getting shot at. I hope to finish this tour of duty soon ... I might add, the war has lost most of its interest for me, as now it is just a question of time ... I can't help but think that it would be sort of silly of me to get killed now." USSBS (8) states that 73rd BW attack on Sakai urban area caused extensive damage to the Kawasaki aircraft plant. According to the 314th BW History (7) the night was clear over the target, Gifu, and 98 aircraft bombed visually after the target was marked by pathfinder planes. Damage and destruc- tion was estimated to be 74% of Gifu. Nine attacks by Jap aircraft damaged one B-29. One plane caught fire between Rota and Saipan and the crew bailed out and everyone was rescued by the Air/Sea Rescue Service. 12/13 July 1945 Sensing that the Japanese may be "on the ropes", LeMay sent his crews out again three nights later to raid Utsunomiya, Ichinomya, Tsuruga and Uwajajima.

The plane survived 131 fighter attacks and made it back to Isely Field. Some references give six planes lost on this mission (4) and Rust (8) gives five planes lost. From the air the Musashino Aircraft Engine Plant looked unscathed after three missions with the loss of nine B-29s. But the USSBS (5) states that, following the first raid on the plant, frantic, almost panicky efforts were made to disperse plant pro- duction and manufacturing levels dropped dramatically (see Figures 2 and 3). The direct effects of the effort were minimal, the indirect effect was great. 13 December 1944 Gen. Hansell next struck the Mitsubishi Aircraft Engine Plant in Nagoya with better success in placing bombs on tar- get. On 13 December 1944, 90 B-29s took off for the Mitsubishi plant and 71 planes bombed visually the primary target and nine the secondary target. Each plane carried 2.5 tons with two squadrons carrying 500 lb. GP bombs, and one squadron carrying incendiary clusters. Bombing results were excellent with 40% of the plant damaged. Nagoya (See Figure 6) is about 35 miles up a bay which became known to the 73rd BW as "Flak Alley" since antiaircraft guns were mounted on both sides of the bay. There were 108 Japanese fighter passes at the B-29s. No plane went down but 35 were damaged and four ditched on the return trip. Of the four crews, only one crew was rescued. At this point one can appreciate Gen. Harold Arnold's request to the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) for the cap- ture of Iwo Jima. This was approved in October 1944 with the invasion set for 19 February 45. The island was too small to stage many troops through for an invasion of the home islands but capture would serve three goals: 1) eliminate the harassing attacks of the Marianas by Japanese bombers from Iwo, 2) pro- vide bases for P-51 fighter escorts for the B-29 and 3) provide a landing base for returning crippled B-29s. 18 December

But the raids by B-29s continued on 7. 8, 10 and 11 May 1945, by 313th BW. Nine B-29s placed 46 tons of HE on the Saeki air field with fair results. The area of burst across the target was ap- proximately 800 feet wide and one enemy aircraft was prob- ably destroyed. 7 May 1945 Matsuyama airfield on Shikoku was bombed by 17 air- craft from 0909 to 0925 from an altitude of 18,900 feet. Eigh- teen attacks by enemy fighters resulted in B-29 gunners dam- aging four enemy aircraft. No B-29 was lost and no crew ca- sualties. Bombing results ranged from excellent to poor. 5 May 1945 During this last phase of the B-29 anti-kamikaze effort, the 313th BW supplied the planes and crews. On this date 41 B-29s deposited 238 tons HE on Oita, Usa, Ibusuhi and Kanoya but lost three B-29s in the effort. On the Oita and Usa mis- sions 34 Japanese aircraft was claimed to be destroyed by B- 29 crews (9).The 313th BW averaged 5.8 tons/A/C and 59.5 tons/A/F.

No planes were lost sowing from an altitude of 6,900 to 8,400 feet. 27/28 July 1945 On the last four mining missions no planes were lost. All nine missions from 22 July to 14 August were run by the dili- gent 504 BG who always ran mining missions every other night except during the period 10-14 August 1945 when many mis- sions were canceled due to peace rumors In summary, during the final phase 3,578 mines were sowed in 17 fields utilizing firing mechanisms as follows: 37% mag- netic, 19% acoustic, 13% subsonic and 31% pressure-magnetic as 1000 lb. 44% and 2000 lb. mines 56%. Mining Mission No. 40 is unique in the loss of three planes from "other causes". Twenty-five planes deposited 189 mines from an altitude between 8,000 to 10,400 feet. The areas hit had all been hit before except Senzaki. The other areas were Shimoneseki Strait and Niigata, Mizyazu and Maizuru on Honshu. 29/30 July 1945 Contributions of the Mining Campaign Toward Ending WWII On 29/30 July 1945 the port of Rashin in Manchuria near the Russian border was hit for the fourth time together with Shimoneseki Strait and Fukuoka on Kyushu. Twenty-six planes sowed 196 mines from an altitude of 7,900 to 12,900 feet with- out the loss of any planes. The U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey estimated that the B- 29 Mining Campaign, which took four and one half months, resulted in the sinking of 770,000 tons and damaged 478,000 tons of Japanese shipping. The B-29 loss rate was less than 1% of the aircraft involved and crew casualties were less than 0.7%. The B-29s deposited 12,053 mines during the campaign for an efficiency rating of 100 tons of shipping sunk or dam- aged per mine expended. The British estimated an efficiency rating, for their European mining campaign, of 50 tons ship- ping sunk or damaged per mine expended. And the ships sunk or damaged were only part of the damage caused by mines. The USSBS stated that the shipping days lost could not be es- timated but were considered just

Eighty B-29s were aloft and 62 visually bombed the plant with excellent results. Nine planes bombed secondary targets and nine planes aborted. Four Japa- nese fighters were claimed destroyed by B-29 gunners. The bomb load on the target was 152.5 HE tons averaging 2.45 tons per plane. The plant responsible for producing Tony and 11 10  Nick Japanese fighters was so heavily damaged that it never resumed production. Forty percent of the bombs fell within 1,000 feet of the aiming point (AP) for the most successful precision daylight attack of the campaign to date. Twelve B- 29s suffered battle damage. The mission was flown at alti- tudes between 25,100 to 29,400 feet.
