Besides neither know, when the retreat occurs, what their losses are or what the enemy's casualties may be." It is not, therefore, through the material factor of losses, and still less through any comparison of figures, a greater number of casualties, that they give in, renouncing the fight and abandoning to the opponent the ground in dispute. Ninety thousand defeated men withdraw before ninety thousand victorious men solely because they have had enough, and they have had enough because they no longer believe in victory, because they are demoralized and have no moral resistance left. Which leads Joseph de Maistre to say: "A battle lost is a battle one believes one has lost, for a battle is never lost materially." And if battles are lost morally, they must also be won in the same way, so that we can add: "A battle won is a battle in which one refuses to acknowledge defeat."   ## p. 315 (#325) ############################################  THE BATTLE: DECISIVE ATTACK 315 De Brack, following Frederick, passes by an old castle in Silesia.

What was expected of these outposts? The possibility of resting in safety from enemy attack. It was necessary, there- fore, that if the enemy appeared he be kept at a dis- tance, and that if he attacked in force he be held long enough for the brigade to safely leave its now dangerous camp and take up battle positions. To rest and to leave camp in safety means protection, that is material protection indispensable to rest and therefore to the condition of the troops, to preservation of their morale, of their confidence in the chiefs. But what did the army corps expect from the brigade? It expected it, during the night of the 4th-5th and during the day of the 5th to: (1) Protect the army corps, at rest or on the march, against any blows, insure its material safety; (2) If the enemy appear, hold him during such time. and at such distance as will allow the army corps to continue its advance on Bitche, to act in accordance with orders.

The Directoire undertakes, therefore, to have the Repub- lic of Genoa furnish, willingly or otherwise, the most nec- essary help. Schérer, overwhelmed by such a task and by sc bold a plan, asks to be relieved of his command in favor of a younger and bolder chief. Salicetti then appears as the government's representa- tive at the Army of Italy; his efforts are at first in vain; he vainly endeavors to have Schérer alter his decision; he vainly asks the Senate of Genoa to lend a few millions to France. He is compelled to resort to threats. Accord- ing to his plans, a body of French troops will occupy Voltri, and by the Bochetta it will seize the Genoese fortified place of Gavi. Schérer partly agrees with the idea, organizes an expeditionary force from the three divisions of Augereau, Laharpe, Meynier, 9,000 men al- together, and gives the command to Masséna with special instructions. The latter is to move to Savone, and to throw on March 26th at Voltri under Pijon an advance guard (3,000 men), the patrols of which will reach San Pier d'Arena, a suburb of Genoa. As for the Gavi ex- pedition, it can wait until the arrival of Bonaparte who has just been appointed in command of the Army of Italy. On March 26th Bonaparte reaches Nice to assume his duties.

To the strict, passive obedience of former centuries we shall therefore always oppose active obedience, necessary consequence of the appeal made always to initiative, and of the tactical use of small, independent masses. And that notion of freedom of action which we find appearing as a protection to our spirit of active discipline, which comes from the necessity of assuring the action of the whole through the combined actions of all partici- pants, we find it also becoming, like the principle of econ- omy of forces, one of the fundamental rules of war. For in every military operation we have seen that our constant preoccupation is to preserve that freedom: free- dom to go to Montenotte, to remain there, to act against Ceva. And, at the end of war, when there are a victor and a vanquished, how will their positions differ except that the one will be free to act and to exact what he wishes from the other, while the latter will be compelled to do and to concede what the victor may decide?

We have seen to what ex- tent its chief has carried out his duty. The result, as we know, was the great success of the German Army of the South. As to Garibaldi, those continuous attacks of January 21st and 23rd have convinced him that he is meeting important German forces. He has been content with a   ## p. 146 (#154) ############################################  146 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR cautious defense. The result: disaster for the French Army of the East. Error is human, you may say, and it is not a crime. But the crime lay in that Garibaldi, having been ordered to join the Army of the East, has not joined it. To carry out the order has never entered his mind. His behavior has been dictated by personal opinions and the desire for personal success. If he had sought to obey, no material obstacle would have prevented it. The Pélissier Division left at Dijon sufficed to occupy General Kettler; the Army of the Vosges could safely join the Army of the East. Garibaldi and General de Failly, two leaders of very different origin, cause the same result, disaster, by the same means: lack of intellectual discipline, neglect of military duty. Obedience would have presented no difficulty in either case; but it had to be understood, and for that reason thought out; the spirit of discipline was necessary. To avoid the mistake, to prevent disaster, that was obtained by mere obedience. But there is a lesson of a still more exalted kind to be drawn from these examples: In our epoch which believes that ideals are unneces- sary, that science and realism govern all things, we still find, to avoid mistakes and disasters, the sole observance of two moral principles: duty and discipline. And these two principles, in order to provide success, require, as shown by the example of General Kettler, knowledge and

Every military idea, every plan, must therefore be accompanied by plans for protec- tion. We must, as in fencing, attack without exposing ourselves, or parry without ceasing to threaten the oppo- nent. A historical example will show us what is protection in the larger sense of the word. On the 4th of August, 1870, the 5th French Army Corps was in the following position: One of its divisions (the 3rd, under General Guyot de Lespart) was at Bitche with a cavalry regiment; Two others (the 1st under General Goze and the 2nd under General de l'Abadie) were at and near Sarre- guemines, together with 3 regiments of cavalry and 6 batteries of the artillery reserve, also the army corps' transport. On that evening, General de Failly, in command of the army corps, received from General Headquarters at Metz the following message: "Support with your two divisions the one you have at Bitche." Metz had learnt the defeat of Wissembourg, and had no doubt that the invasion of Alsace by considerable forces would soon follow. It had been decided to reinforce the troops of Marshal MacMahon. So on the evening of the 4th, General de Failly gets the order: "Concentrate all your forces at Bitche."

Instruction would therefore be useless which merely pointed out these prin- ciples without going into their application. For that reason we propose to now study in detail the work of the 5th Corps' flank guard. We have seen how forces were divided into a main body and protective troops, in order to allow the army corps to reach Bitche in spite of the enemy; how it was intended to thus carry out the order given, by opposing any intentions of the enemy. We have also seen by what estimates of time, what use of information, the main flank guard succeeded in being, at the proper time, at dangerous cross-roads. Let us see to-day how, the opponent arriving, the protective troops will operate; what tactics and disposi- tions they must adopt in order to carry out their purpose. Let us examine whether these conditions adopted for protection, which we have considered necessary are effectively sufficient. I have supposed, for that purpose, an enemy force, estimated at not less than a division, encamped on August 4th towards Alt-Altheim (6 kilometers from the fron- 121   ## p. 122 (#130) ############################################  122 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR tier, 12 from Bettwiller), and starting the next day with the intention of holding to the mountains the 5th French Corps, of preventing its junction with the forces of Alsace. The adversary also, by pursuing the concentra- tion of his forces towards the Sauer, seeks to maintain the dispersion of ours. I have shown that, under these circumstances, with an enemy attack, the 5th French Army Corps of 1870 could not have arrived, that it could have brought none of its forces to Bitche.

To be disciplined does not mean to keep silent, to do only what one thinks can be done without risk of being compromised, the art of avoiding responsibilities, but it means acting in the spirit of the orders received, and to that end assuring by thought and planning the possibility of carrying out such orders, assuring by strength of character the energy to assume the risks necessary in their execution. The laziness of the mind results in lack of discipline as much as does insubordination. Lack of ability and ignorance are not either excuses, for knowl- edge is within reach of all who seek it. In execution of the order received, de Failly ordered on the evening of the 4th: His 1st Division to advance by the main road of Bitche as far as possible. The 2nd was only to start the next day, and then only in part. It included 2 brigades (Maussion and Lapas- set). To start them on the evening of the 4th was to leave Sarreguemines unprotected. For several days had been   ## p. 105 (#113) ############################################  INTELLECTUAL DISCIPLINE 105 seen, along the frontier, numerous enemy patrols, which had however merely exchanged rifle shots with our scouts. And so one did not believe in abandoning Sarreguemines on the 4th. For the same reasons it will not be aban- doned on the 5th. The same reasons will occur again at Rohrbach, at Bitche, and because they prevail the 5th Corps will not arrive. Instead of going to Bitche, de Failly will seek to protect everything; instead of obeying, he will be guided by personal opinions. That is lack of intellectual discipline. Its results will soon be apparent. On the evening of August 4th, the 1st Division (Goze) had covered 7 kilometers; it bivouacked at the Wissing farm, 2 kilometers from the frontier. On the 5th, it m

In spite of the necessity of marching without delay on Montezemolo in the morning of the 14th, the greater part of the army will take the direction of Dego. During that morning, Masséna will be joined by Laharpe, Ménard's brigade, Dommartin and a part of the Au- gereau division, giving him 18,000 men to be employed before Dego.   ## p. 92 (#98) ##############################################  92 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR ATTACK OF DEGO (APRIL 14TH) While keeping the enemy dispersed it is now possible to seriously attack Dego. Its situation is known by the previous day's recon- naissance; according to the latest reports, no new troops have reached there. Bonaparte then decides to obtain from the numerical superiority which he possesses a com- plete decisive result: to capture the enemy forces in Dego. For that purpose, Masséna will attack on the right bank in two columns. The right column of 1,000 to 1,200 men under Lasal- cette reaches Gerini by the same road as on the previous day and arrives about 1 o'clock at Bric of Sodan. Following that crest, the advance guard proceeds to Bric del Caret, reaching it in time to repulse a reinforc ing battalion arriving from Squanetto to Dego, two other battalions later. The main body having thus seized with its advance guard one of the roads of Dego, it resumes its advance on Majani, throws back the posts of Della Stella and Del Poggio, and connects with Masséna at the foot of Mount Gerolo, about 3 o'clock. The left column, under Masséna, has proceeded slowly to allow the others to surround the town; during the greater part of the day it occupies Vermenano, Costa Lupara, keeping up a fire against the enemy by means of numerous snipers and of the two guns at its disposal. The purpose is merely to make a demonstration. At 3 o'clock only, seeing the progress made by Lasalcette, communication established, Masséna rapidly ascends, with his reserve in hand, the slope of Castello, deplo

On either side, as Von der Goltz says, "when the enemy threatens, the strategists study the ground, draw up imaginary plans of cam- paign and seek positions which they may or may not find." Such is the brief history of our sad experience of 1870. First, as regards positions, we find Cadenbronn, Froeschwiller, the forest of Haye, each one of which in turn is to assure the safety of the nation. Secondly, there are imaginary plans. We shall cross the Rhine: where, when, how, by what means? that mat- ters little. A junction with the Austrians is to be made in Bohemia. Combinations are believed valuable in them- selves, without regard to time, to space, to the aim sought. Thirdly, the idea of battle has so disappeared-and it has disappeared because it is thought unnecessary, because one hopes like the immortal Berwick to gain a victory without battle-that when troops are led to the fight suc- cess is expected from the mere disposal of these troops with regard to one another, from a perfect alignment, from some new formation or other. Battles are planned like reviews; there is no thought of the enemy or of the blows to be struck against him or of the hammer with which to strike.

On the other hand, all their legs and arms have been carefully bound by the decision of means to be employed, by a list of childish recommendations. If the enemy appears, if the means prescribed should not fit the circumstances-and that always happens-they must either disobey or let themselves be beaten, solutions both of which lead to disaster. The evil is visible to the Commander in Chief. He seeks to forestall it by adding at the end of his order: "It must not, however, prevent an energetic march on the enemy, if the opportunity occurs, but without pursuing him too far." He only increases such evil by creating doubt and confusion in the mind of men to whom he says simultaneously: "Withdraw and advance.

But that overwhelming and unexpected blow need not be struck at the whole enemy army. To defeat an oppo- nent, it is unnecessary to "simultaneously cut off his arms, his legs and his head while piercing his chest and stabbing him in the stomach." (General Cardot.) In the same way, to overcome an army's flank, its center, any important part of the whole, will be sufficient for the re- sult sought. The army, moreover, is a delicate being which thrives only on discipline. Discipline is the main strength of armies, but it is also the prime necessity to their exist- ence; discipline alone, thanks to hierarchic organization permitting the transmission and execution of orders, en- ables the commander to control any action. To break the chain is, therefore, to transform the tactical units into disjointed human masses; it renders the execution of orders impossible, it destroys the will of the commander, it prevents all action. And to break the chain, it is enough to spread moral or ma- terial disorder, to upset the organization at one point of the whole. All this brings us to the application of one overwhelm- ing blow at one point, which Napoleon has put into words by saying that, in order to win, it is sufficient "to be t

Let us, for instance, suppose a body of troops at rest in the position a, b, c, to be guarding along DE against an enemy expected from the north, and a regiment ordered to furnish the Outposts. The first idea will consist in extending the men uni- formly along DE. If DE is 4,000 meters in length, that will allow one man per meter; that would permit resistance, but very weak resistance.

How can sound judgment and decision be trained in a school? Marshal von Moltke explains it thus: "The teaching of military facts is especially intended to cause the pupil to use his knowledge (that is, the theory which has been taught him). But a result of this nature cannot be obtained if the instructor merely lec- tures and the pupil merely listens. It can be obtained, however, quite naturally when the teacher adds to his technical instruction some forms of practice in the course of which the matters taught are applied to specific cases."   ## p. 15 (#21) ##############################################  THE TEACHING OF WAR 15 Such is the method used: first learn the rules, then apply them to specific cases. It will be shown later what is meant by "specific cases.' Writing along the same lines, General de Peucker adds: "Officers must be trained constantly to act independently, in order to develop in them the power of using their theoretical knowledge in the practical questions of life. To dimly realize some scientific truth does not necessarily mean that it can be found again later by reasoning. It is a long way from conception to the precious ability of turning acquired military knowledge into the foundation of our decisions. "Between these two things: scientific conception and art of command there is an enormous step which the method of teaching must enable a pupil to take if it is to be an efficient method."

Every chief of every unit must therefore think of obey- ing at the same time as he thinks of commanding. Before dictating his orders, he must be inspired by those he has received. To what extent and how? That is what we shall examine. In war, to obey is a difficult thing. For the obedience. must be in the presence of the enemy, and in spite of the enemy, in the midst of danger, of varied and unforeseen circumstances, of a menacing unknown, in spite of fatigue from many causes. "While dispositions taken in peace times can be weighted at length, and infallibly lead to the result de- sired, such is not the case with the use of forces in war, with operations. In war, once hostilities are begun, our will soon encounters the independent will of the enemy. Our dispositions strike against the freely-made disposi- tions of the enemy." (Moltke.) Then how should we carry out the execution of an order received, unless we preserve our freedom of action in spite of the enemy? The art of war is the art of preserving one's freedom of action. On the eve of Montenotte, we see Laharpe ordered to succor the half-brigade of Rampon;   ## p. 101 (#109) ############################################  INTELLECTUAL DISCIPLINE 101 Augereau, leaving Savone at midnight, ordered to fall in behind Laharpe as reserve; Masséna, leaving Finale in two columns, ordered to reach Montenotte Inférieur; Sérurier ordered to make a demonstration on Ceva; Cervoni ordered to hold the road of Voltri; Rampon ordered to resist at Montenegi

For that purpose one attacks him until his position and frontage are known. But one attacks with the intention of not pushing the struggle; each column will therefore send forward only patrols, scouts who advance, retire, disengage themselves easily when necessary. As means: chiefly long-range action for the same purpose of acting on the enemy with- out allowing oneself to be grasped, snipers, artillery.

The lines of communication and assembly places in the rear are also held (crossing of Bormida, village of Rochetta). Anyway, the day of the 13th has been lost for the progress of Bonaparte's plan to march on Ceva, and that loss is due to the resistance of Casseria (owing to the late- ness of Augereau) and the resistance of Dego. So long as Casseria holds, one cannot attack Dego in force. The pushing by Augereau of 2,000 men on Millesimo is the sole result obtained on the 13th. Moreover, food is lacking for this army assembled around Cairo. But on the morning of the 14th Provera capitulates, the much-desired road from Millesimo to Montezemolo is open, one can resume against Colli the execution of the plan prepared, delayed by two days of bad luck but rendered urgent by the army's complete lack of food and supplies, and by its weariness. Yet as long as Dego is not taken there is not the necessary safety from that quar- ter: between that town and Acqui, Beaulieu can assemble many troops and endanger the whole progress of the army directed on Montezemolo. Dego will be attacked, although the reconnaissance of the 13th has shown the importance of the position, and it may have been further strengthened by additional work or the arrival of more troops. In spite of the necessity of marching without delay on Montezemolo in the morning of the 14th, the greater part of the army will take the directio

(That mode of procedure will be usual for the Emperor.) In accordance with these orders: Rampon, reinforced to 2,300 men and 2 guns, spends the night at Montenegino; further back, Laharpe, after having dropped a few companies at Savone and 1 bat- talion at the Madone de Savone whence he will connec with Masséna by occupying Monte Occulto, comes at   ## p. 81 (#87) ##############################################  THE ECONOMY OF FORCES 81 midnight to the Doria Palace with about 7,000 men, namely: The 14th half-brigade arrived late from Stella where it has merely left a detachment; The Cervoni brigade (70th and 99th half-brigades) which Bonaparte has reviewed during the evening in Savone. These troops will attack Argenteau in the early morn- ing, on the front and on the flank. Masséna, with the Ménard brigade (from the broken- up Meynier division) comes at midnight to the Plan del Melo; as soon as Laharpe advances he will attack at day- break, towards Montenotte, in order to cut off Argenteau and overthrow all reinforcements which might reach him. The front line troops are to bivouac about midnight to the south of Altare: Augereau at Mallare with 6,000 men; Dommartin with 3,000 men at Monteffredo; Joubert with 2,000 men at Al- tare; where they will await further or- ders.
