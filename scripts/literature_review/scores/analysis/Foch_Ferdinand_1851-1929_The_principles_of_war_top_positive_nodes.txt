What became then of the plan of General Moltke? Once more we find strategy, however brilliant, at the mercy of tactics. As regards the cavalry battle south of Wysokow, both sides have claimed a victory. Both may be right if we consider only that battle in itself. In reality, the Aus- trian cavalry showed itself very brilliant, well drilled and of undoubted merit. It was not properly commanded. The Prussian cavalry was more cautious, less thoroughly trained: it had no such speed or piercing power. But it was efficiently handled. It displayed tactical ability. As far as results are concerned, it is victorious. Two caval- ries do not fight just for the purpose of finding out which is the best.

The Prussian Uhlans are enveloped by the Austrian Cuirassiers; being at close quarters they cannot use their lances. Part of them are hastily withdrawn to the Neu- stadt road. The position of the Prussian Uhlans was already fairly critical when intervention occurs from the 3rd Squadron Hessian Cuirassiers which being attached to the Rosen- zweig Brigade had placed itself behind the Wäldchen. The squadron skirts the edge of the wood and throws itself at the flank of the Prussian Uhlans. General Wnück joins the 8th Dragoons which then moves toward the northeastern point of Wäldchen and attacks the Hessian Cuirassiers without letting himself be stopped by fire coming from the woods. The 1st and 2nd Squadrons make a frontal attack, the 3rd and 4th envelop the Austrian right. A new strug- gle takes place, but the enveloping tactics and superior numbers of the Prussians (five-and-a-half squadrons against three-and-a-half) give them the decision. The Austrian Cuirassiers retire slowly and the Prussian Uhlans return behind the crest. The Austrian infantry in the midst of the tumult that reigns in Wäldchen does not suspect the cavalry battle going on close at hand and it does not intervene; it is incapable of the happy initiative shown by the Prussian infantry of Wysokow.

It is easy to see, however, that if it be occupied as I have suggested it would be difficult to envelop by its left, on account of the wooded nature of the ground.

The 5th Prussian Corps bivouacs on the ground; in the evening its outposts stretch from Kramolna to Wyso- kow, and thence to the Neustadt road, with a sentry-group at Starkoc. The 6th Austrian Corps has lost 225 officers and 7,275 men, of whom 2,500 are prisoners. A few more remarks can be made about this end of the battle: (1) The Prussian cavalry acts till the end. After having stopped the enemy's efforts to debouch from the woods, it attacks the enemy artillery and captures three guns; later, it carries on the pursuit. With a professional value smaller than that of the Austrian cavalry, it never- theless knows how to do its share in the battle, how to observe the tactical principles of an advance guard; above all, it is utilized by a chief who makes it until the last produce all the results of which it is capable. (2) The Austrian artillery has also shown itself very superior to the Prussian artillery, by its armament and the accuracy of its fire. It inflicts on the Prussian bat- teries, arriving one by one, losses which forbid them to carry on the conflict. However, the Prussians have won at the end of the day. The artillery battle is not, there-   ## p. 250 (#260) ############################################  250 THE PRINCIPLES OF WAR fore, any more than the cavalry battle, a decisive action which finally determines the result of the engagement.

The same preoccupation of giving to fire all its power is constantly evidenced by the Prussian infantry of 1870, although its armament is then inferior to the French "chassepot." One seeks first of all to reach a position from which the enemy can be held, crushed by fire, while behind this position is being organized the assault, which by its ad- vance uses and develops the acquired superiority. The position is reached by small units, extended in any possible way, taking advantage of all natural cover, the primary consideration being to reach there without suffer- ing from the enemy's fire. Once that position is occupied, the battle for superiority of fire is begun, every effort being made to maintain both fire control and fire direction (objectives and ranges). This lasts as long as may be necessary to prepare the attack, which is normally carried out chiefly by troops ad- vanced in echelons from the rear, reinforcing the units in the firing line. To-day we find the same preoccupation of efficient fire control appear in the German maneuvers. Von der Goltz writes: "Another phenomenon which does not lack importance has also been observed since the war of 1870. I refer to that new principle concerning infantry, principle in accordance with which that branch of the serv

But these indispensable strong points must be sought 24 kilometers away. If the Austrians adopted the idea of an offensive for the purpose of throwing the Prussians back into the de- file, they must first seize Wenzelsberg and Wysokow and use them as strong points and starting points for all their movements to that end. If, on the other hand, they followed the plan of taking up positions near Kleny while preserving the right to further action against the defile, it was still the posses- sion of Wysokow and Wenzelsberg which they must obtain. These points were not more than 13 kilometers from the two Jonack and Hertweck Brigades, which could moreover receive prompt assistance, and therefore spend themselves lavishly. Thirteen kilometers as against twenty-four. If the Prussians and Austrians started at the same hour the Austrians could therefore fight during three or four hours with an undeniable superiority of numbers. But in reality, the Prussian plans for the 27th were two hours behind those of the Austrians. At 5 o'clock in one case, at 3 o'clock in the other, the start was to be made. Altogether there would be an advantage of five or six hours in favor of the Austrian brigades. During all   ## p. 181 (#189) ############################################  THE ADVANCE GUARD AT NACHOD 181 that time they would only face a weak advance guard of six-and-a-half battalions. They also had a cavalry divi- sion. Such were the particularly difficult conditions (they could be partly foreseen, that is why I mention them) under which the Prussian general had to bring his column out of a long defile, and then deploy it. To insure the success of these operations was the duty of his advance guard, a very heavy duty if we remember the numerical advantage which it must overcome, and the length of resistance it must provide. We shall now see how the advance guard succeeded. THE EVENING OF JUNE 26T

In order to be sure of getting the wood, our point of attack, we shall use there all the forces we have, all the rifles and all the guns. We must ask the artillery to prepare the attack, and for that purpose to place itself where it can observe (or obtain indirect observation). But the hostile artillery will observe it also and interfere with it, so that it should take a position from which it can observe without being observed, or else obtain a superiority over that enemy artillery. For that purpose it also requires numbers. The Wenzelsberg wood being seized, the plateau can- not any longer be held by the Prussian advance guard. The attack of the second position could then be under- taken.

As to the three conditions of preparation, execution and protection, we have seen what they implied. In any case, there is but one offensive to be undertaken at a given time, with but one objective. All the forces employed for that operation, infantry, artillery, cavalry, engineers, are detached only to the extent absolutely necessary for p

The Reille Brigade is intrusted with this double mis- sion. For that purpose, it starts in the direction of the Sandberg, protected by many skirmishers towards the wood of Aue, the 34th in the first line. The 40th is in echelons behind and to the left; the 21st Chasseurs in echelons behind and to the right. The attack first strikes the Clement Regiment, then the Sandberg battery of 15 guns is seized; it insures the pos- session of Aue and Sandberg; it carries on the pursuit with part of its forces, and resumes with what remains the flank attack with which it is intrusted. The time has come to end it all. It is nearly 3 o'clock. The maneuver will at last be carried out, to the construc- tion of which work has been going on since morning. The artillery has meanwhile arrived; it takes up posi- tions near Beulwitz, then advances and prepares by its fire the attack of the infantry.

Which is also clearly pictured by the engineer Mümp- fling when he writes: "About 3 o'clock, the French columns rushed on us like an avalanche. Within a second we were cut into three pieces, surrounded with a circle of fire and backed up against the river." At the signal of attack given by Lannes, all the troops near Beulwitz have advanced, pushing forward: A frontal attack, composed of: On the right, the 9th and 10th Hussars; In the center, the 54th Infantry; On the left, the 21st Chasseurs; In the second line, the 87th Infantry and 17th Light Infantry; A flank attack: 34th Infantry (3 battalions).
