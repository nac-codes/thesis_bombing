They thought they could use it like a scalpel in a bloody hospital operation, where as in truth military force is a pretty damn blunt instrument. You use it for maximum shock effect-hard, fast, and continuous-and get the job done. They wanted to use it to just cut a little here, and cut a little there, and sew that one up, and cut a little more over here. That was their whole philosophy on using air power in Vietnam. And of course, that was a bloody disaster. Catton: General LeMay, did you have to fight those guys all the time to get them to give us some authority and some capability to use air over there? LeMay: Constantly, constantly. To start off with on this flexible response business, I think that phrase is an outgrowth to counter the “immorality” of the massive retaliation that everybody thought meant we would dump all the atomic weapons we had automatically on a poor helpless foe. That was immoral; flexible response was, “No, we don’t have to do that. We are just going to use what force is necessary to do the job.” Of course, this violates the principles of war, and over the centuries we have found that it doesn’t work. 13’ When Robert McNamara became Secretary of Defense in 1961, he assembled on his staff a small group of experts drawn from various fields who became known, by critics and admirers alike, as the “Whiz Kids.” Along with McNamara, they dominated formulation of defense policy and decisionmaking in the Defense Department for the next eight years. The most prominent of these men were Alain G. Enthoven, Charles J. Hitch, K. Wayne Smith, Henry Rowen, Russell Murray, Adam Yarmolinsky, and Daniel Ellsberg.

The Army continued its predominance in people and mission, although there were a few Air Force officers and men there to train pilots in the small 3,000-man South Vietnamese Air Force. From 1961 until the Americanization of the war in 1965, the size of the MAAG gradually expanded, and its mission changed in two fundamental ways: first, the administrative burden of distributing and accounting for US. aid increased dramatically; second, the advisors’ direct combat support to the South Vietnamese forces became routine. In January 1962, the MAAG in Saigon became the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MAC-V), the principal American military command that conducted the war. Ronald H.

We always were forced to use just enough military power to get the job done and no more. Of course, when you use that philosophy, you always come out a loser.

Taylor (1901-87) was a professional soldier who graduated from West Point in 1922. A brilliant student and leader, he went into the Field Artillery but returned to the academy to teach on two occasions in the interwar years. In July 1941, he joined the staff of Gen. George C. Marshall, Army Chief of Staff. In World War I1 Taylor served as Chief of Staff of the 82d Airborne Division, and later Commander of the lOlst Airborne Division. He led that division in the Normandy Invasion, parachuting behind Utah Beach and capturing key causeways leading from the beaches to the interior areas. Following the war, he rose in the Army, becoming Superintendent of West Point (1946-49); Commander, U.S. Eighth Army in Korea (1953); and Chief of Staff, U.S. Army (1955-59). He retired in 1959 and wrote a successful book, The Uncertain Trumpet (1959), which criticized the Eisenhower administra- tion’s military policy of massive retaliation and advocated a new policy of flexible response. Then in an unprecented action, General Taylor came out of retirement to become President Kennedy’s Military Representative to the President. He served for two years in the White House, then President Kennedy selected him to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He led the JCS from 1962-64.

Although this Church-Case Amendment was weakened in the Senate, it became law in the summer of 1972. In addition, there were other laws enacted which placed limitations on US. military actions in Vietnam. In November 1973, Congress enacted the War Powers Resolution, which limited to 90 days the President's ability to send U.S. forces into combat without receiving congressional approval. This resolution culminated years of growing Congressional resistance to the war which, all told, prevented the United States from coming to the rescue of South Vietnam when it was invaded. U.S. military aid to South Vietnam dropped from $2.2 billion in 1973 to $700 million in 1975, the year that North Vietnam invaded and conquered South Vietnam.

For a brief period he shared power with five other Soviet leaders who constituted the Presidium. In early 1954 Khrushchev emerged as the sole leader of the Soviet Union. A powerful, somewhat eccentric leader, he changed the direction of Soviet history in 1956 in a secret speech to the 20th Party Congress in which he denounced the excesses of Stalin’s one-man rule and repudiated the concept that Soviet Communism was the single, infallible authority in the communist world. In the same speech he outlined a new Soviet foreign policy of “peaceful coexistence” with the western nations. Unlike Stalin, Khrushchev traveled extensively in the West, including the United States, visiting with President Eisenhower and other American officials in 1959. A dominating, often crude figure, he attended a session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York and when a speaker made some anti-Soviet remarks, the Soviet leader shouted back obscenities, pounded his fists, and removed his shoe, banging it repeatedly on the desk. In 1961, when Khrushchev met with the then newly elected President Kennedy in Vienna, Austria, Khrushchev perceived that Kennedy would be a weak president. Shortly thereafter Khrushchev moved to change the postwar status of Berlin. In a speech to the Soviet military in June 1961, he outlined his plans for unilaterally removing Berlin from control of the United States, France, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union, making i

In the first year of the Johnson administration that figure grew to 23,310. The Americanization of the war began in 1965 with the introduction of large units of Army and Marine forces. By the end of 1965, there were 180,000 American military personnel in Vietnam; by January 1969 that figure had grown to 542,000. In the early years code names were used to designate combat forces in Vietnam. FARM GATE was the code name for the first Air Force combat unit, the 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron, sent to Vietnam in October 1961.

A prolific writer, General Kenney was the author of several books, including a reminiscence of his war experiences, General Kenney Reports: A Personal History of the Pacific War (New York, 1949; reprint, Washington, 1987). Lt. Gen. Clements McMullen (1892-1959) was both Chief of Staff and Deputy Com- mander of the Strategic Air Command from January 1947 to November 1948. A senior officer in the prewar Army Air Corps, McMullen was a rated pilot, an aeronautical engineer, and an expert in supply and maintenance. During World War I1 he was a general officer, serving in the United States and the Southwest Pacific. He commanded logistics, maintenance, and supply organizations and in 1944-45 worked directly for General Kenney as the Commander of the Far East Area Service Command. Following the war, Maj. Gen. McMullen was Chief of Staff for the Pacific Air Forces before moving to the Strategic Air Command. When Kenney became the SAC Commander in March 1946 he retained his former position as US. Military Air Advisor to the United Nations. He devoted most of his time and attention to the United Nations’ position.

Mao was the principal Chinese marxist theorist, soldier, and leader in the struggle against Chiang Kai-shek‘s Nationalist Chinese government. Chiang Kai-shek was a general and leader of the Chinese Nationalist government from 1928 to 1949, and subsequently, the Nationalist government in exile on Taiwan from 1949 to 1975. For almost thirty years, 1920 to 1949, the Nationalists and the Communists fought for control of China. In 1931 Japan seized Manchuria, China’s northern province, and in 1937 the Japanese invaded central China and forced Chaing’s government and armies to retreat into the interior provinces in the south. Mao’s Communist armies, enlarged and restructured to face the Japanese threat, were located in the northern provinces. See Jerome Ch’en, Ma0 and the Chinese Revolution (London, 1965); Maurice Meisner, Mao’s China: A History of the Peoples Republic (New York, 1977); Barbara W. Tuchman, Stilwell and the American Experitwe in China (New York, 1970). Hankow, China, was a Japanese-controlled city in central China. Japanese forces were using it as a supply base for a major offensive into southern China in late 1944. On December 8, 1944, General LeMay sent 94 E29s over Hankow where they dropped incendiary bombs. Although smoke and debris obliterated the target areas for most of the B-29s, damage to the city was severe: 40-50 percent burned out. Maj. Gen. Claire Chennault, Commander of Fourteenth Air Force and Air Advisor to General Chiang Kai-shek, said that the raid “destroyed Hankow as a major base.’ Craven and Cate, AAF in WWZZ, V, 143-144.

In the 1920s and 1930s Arnold remained in the small Army Air Service and Air Corps, rising in rank and holding several significant commands. In September 1938, he became Chief of the Air Corps, with the rank of major general. During World War 11, General Arnold served as Commanding General, Army Air Forces (AAF). The AAF expanded during his tenure from 22,000 airmen and 3,900 aircraft to 2,400,000 men and women and 75,000 airplanes. During the war, General Arnold suffered several heart attacks, causing him to retire in 1946. He was succeeded by General Carl Spaatz. A recent biography is Thomas A. Coffey, HAP The Story of the US.

Ehrhart, (Washington, 1979), 168-185. 59 Gen. George C. Marshall (1890-1959) was the Army Chief of Staff from 1939 to 1945. A brilliant strategist and statesman, Marshall has been credited with being the architect and organizer of the United States victory in World War 11. He was one of the most significant American statesmen of the twentieth century. In May-June 1945, General Marshall and War Department planners were reviewing the final details of Operations OLYMPIC and CORONET, the Allied invasion of Kyiishii and Honshc, the two major islands constituting Japan. Air and naval leaders tried to make the case that military pressure, if air and sea operations continued uninterrupted, would become so great against Japan that it would surrender and the invasion would not be necessary. Marshall and his planners disagreed, citing the fanatical Japanese defense of Okinawa. Subsequently, all senior military leaders, including General Arnold and Admiral King, agreed on the plan to invade Japan. See For

He was a driver. Through the years we have not realized how much we owe him, and how he drove that air force.68 LeMay: I knew what was expected of me out in the Pacific, but I didn’t feel that I was being lashed by General Arnold back in the Pentagon. Johnson: No one felt that Arnold was lashing, but he demanded and he expected it. I knew that. Kohn: Did you all feel in the Pacific that you had done the job without the atomic bomb, that the atomic bomb was, in a sense, just icing on the cake? LeMay: It wasn’t exactly icing on the cake. It is true that the war was over before the atomic bomb was dropped. We knew that because we had broken their code; we knew the Japanese had approached the Russians and asked them to negotiate an end to the war.69 The Russians didn’t say anything about it, and we couldn’t say anything about it because that would tell the Japanese we had broken their codes.
