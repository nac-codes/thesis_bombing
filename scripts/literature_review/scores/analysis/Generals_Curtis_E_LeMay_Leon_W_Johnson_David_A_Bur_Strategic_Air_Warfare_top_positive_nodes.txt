So severe were these losses that Eighth Air Force did not return again to Germany until January 1944.

The other point which is obvious, of course, is that the bombers out-ranged the fighters, so that the fighters could not make the long haul with the bombers. As General LeMay says-and I am just affirming-nobody wanted to go without fighters. When we started operating out of the Marianas, for example, and out of India-China against Japan, we didn’t have any fighters that could go with us. We would have loved to have had them, and as soon as we could, we got them, and used them. Johnson: At first, in Europe we thought we could handle the enemy’s fighters better than we did. We handled them quite well until they started those nose attacks on our formation and came through, breaking up the formation. I remember very well we were going to do a mission down to Bordeaux, and I asked, “How many fighters are there?” Intelligence had predicted twenty- five. I said, “Oh, we can handle those all right,” because the enemy hadn’t had much experience. We had no trouble with them.” But those yellow- nosed babies over there learned how to go through our formations, they would break us up, and we were in real trouble then. LeMay: Another weakness of ours right from the start was our horrible gunnery. Gunnery was pretty low on the totem pole in peacetime. You never could get enough ammunition. I remember down at Langley Field before the war everybody shot skeet. When that was cut out, I gathered up all the old skeet ammunition. Then I had the gunners fire the then-standard flexible gunnery course. I took them to the skeet range and shot up all the ammunition I had accumulated over a period of months.

In early May another two groups, one a reequipped and the other a remanned older unit, joined the command. Thus, within one month in late spring 1943 the number of bombers and crews in Eighth Air Force doubled, easing the pressures on the crews. Maj. Gen.

Capable of oftloading 120,000 pounds of fuel, the KC-135 had a range, depending upon the fuel load, in excess of 3,000 miles. Boeing built several variations of this aircraft for the Air Force's specialized missions: electronic reconnaissance, airborne command and control, electronic warfare, and military airlift. In all, the Air Force acquired 820 KC-135s and 45 C-135s. In 1981 SAC began a lengthy program to modernize the KC-135 fleet, equipping approximately one-half of the tankers with new engines and other modifications which are planned to extend the life of each aircraft by an estimated 27,000 flying hours (and the usage of the fleet to the year 2020).

The Germans began using large formations of fighters, which attacked the Allied bombers first by firing rockets at a range of 1,ooO to 1,700 yards into the rear of the bomber formations. Then the German fighters shot off explosive cannon shells and sent air-to-air bombs into the formations.

For the entire raid, 54 of the 177 B-24s were destroyed or damaged so severely they could not return; 522 men were killed or captured. Johnson and his crew hit the target and returned successfully to North Africa. For his leadership, courage, and heroism he won the Medal of Honor, one of five awarded that day. Shortly after the Ploesti raid, Johnson became the commander of Eighth Air Force's 14th Combat Wing-a wing consisting of two, later four, groups of B-24s and B-17s. For the duration of the European war he led this wing, participating in every major bombing campaign: Central Europe, Normandy, Northern France, the Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace

For the remainder of the year, American B-17 and B-24 missions to the continent were characterized by small numbers, short distances, and limited damage to the enemy. The bombing mission to Lille, France, on October 9, 1942, was typical. Early in the morning the Eighth dispatched 108 E17s and E24s to attack railroad yards ;and industrial areas. First, the bombers of the 97th, 301st, 92d, 306th, and 93d Bomb Groups formed up over England and began their flight across the channel. Then, three P-38 fighter squadrons joined the bombers at mid-channel and escorted them to the target and back. En route, 29 bombers turned back because of mechanical or crew problems. The remaining 79 bombers flew to Lille and dropped 16,700 pounds of high explosives on the steel mills and rail yards. The bombing pattern was poor, with many bombs falling outside of the target area and causing many civilian casualties. Over the city, the German Air Force attacked the American bomber formation with FW190 fighters, but their successes were few, shooting down but one B-17, damaging another, and damaging 10 E24s. Despite American bombers’ defensive skills in fending off the German fighters, the mission had glaring problems. Inexperienced crews contributed to the bombing inaccuracies, and the performance of the E24s was very poor. Of the 24 B-24s that started from bases in England, 14 turned back for mechanical reasons, and the 10 thai reached Lille were shot up badly. When Lt. John Stewart, for example, landed his B-24, named Bomerang, it had more than 200 bullet holes in its fuselage and wings. His ground crew chief, IWSgt Charles A.

It was the first Eighth Air Force group equipped with B-24 Liberator bombers. During ihe winter and spring months of 1943, the 44th lost in combat 20 of its original force of 27 E24s and had another 7 damaged so severely as to be declared as beyond repair. Not until April 1943 did replacement aircraft and crews arrive in England. Even with this infusion of new people and planes, the loss rate among crews was so high that the bomb group lacked experienced pilots, navigators, and bombardiers. Of the 90 crewmen, for instance, who arrived in England in November 1942 with the groups’s 67th Bomb Squadron, less than ten remained in mid-May.

I didn’t figure out what happened for two or three months: the crews could do simple arithmetic, and at the rates we were losing crews and getting replacements, the last B-17 would go off on a mission 30 days later.

Johnson flew and fought with the Eighth throughout the war, from its activation in January 1942 until victory in Europe in May 1945. The Eighth had only 24 officers and no aircraft when it went to England in April 1942. Three years and a month later in May 1945 it was the United States’ and the Allies’ largest and most powerful bomber command, with 171,022 people and 4,080 aircraft-2,646 bombers and 1,434 fighters. Johnson was one of the Eighth’s first four flying officers, having responsibility for operations and training in early 1942. He went to Europe in June 1942, working as a staff officer directly for Maj. Gen. Ira C. Eaker, Commander, VIII Bomber Command. Although the first American bomb group arrived in England in July, the first strategic air strikes were not flown until mid-August. From that point forward into 1943, a new American bomb group arrived in England every few months. Initially, these inexperienced bomb groups fared poorly in combat: bombing accuracy was poor, navigation was inaccurate, and crew and aircraft losses were high. General Eaker, his staff, and group commanders established in the fall of 1942 an operational training school in England. Johnson, as the command’s operations and training officer, had direct responsibility for starting and running this school. His successful leadership at the school led to his selection by General Eaker in January 1943 to command one of Eighth Air Force’s first combat groups outfitted with B-24 Liberators: the 44th Bomb Group. In the winter and spring months of 1943, Colonel Johnson’s 44th Bomb Group experienced perhaps the roughest time of any unit in the Eighth Air Force. The 44th had arrived at Shipdham, England, in November 1942 with 27 B-24s and 90 crews. Over the next 7 months the group received a few replacement aircraft and crews, but despite these additions the group’s combat losses were staggering: 20 B-24s lost in combat acti

As a matter of fact, at the beginning of the decade we had bombers that would go faster than fighters. That leap forward gave great impetus to the bombing end of the picture and began to fulfill our earlier expectations. I don’t think there was any stress on the bombers over the fighters; we had attack airplanes and observation airplanes also. However, we never had enough airplanes to call it a strategic air force. Burchinal: Those bombers were Martin B-lOs, weren’t they?3 LeMay: Yes. There was no radical change in theory or roles but a big jump in the performance of bomber equipment. Johnson: Personally, I don’t think we had a sense of mission early in the 1930s. The world had been made safe for democracy not too long before, and there seemed no chance of a war. We weren’t conscious of Hitler. I happened to be in the Philippines during those times, and we had a bomb squadron, a fighter squadron, an observation squadron, and a pursuit squadron over there. We flew around the islands and did our training because that’s what you did in peacetime. I know that we didn’t have a sense of purpose at that time. We didn’t see anything on the horizon; we weren’t worried about anything. We were just worried about getting enough airplanes to fly, and we were worried about getting our flying done.

Before World War I1 he was the P-47 project officer, shepherding the aircraft through testing and development into production. For much of the war Bradley remained at Wright Field as Chief of the Fighter Branch and Flight Test Section. In 1945 he went to the Pacific theater, serving as Chief of Staff, Fifth Air Force. An experienced aeronautical engineer, Bradley returned to Wright Field after the war and worked on refueling technologies for extending the range of bombers and fighters.
