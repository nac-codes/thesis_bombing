Conant (611– 12), discusses it in the con- text of the 1949 attempt by the Harvard Board of Overseers (of which Cabot was a member) to block Galbraith’s appointment as professor. Atissue, ostensibly, was Galbraith’s “intellectual dishonesty” when he chal-lenged Cabot’s version of the Survey chairman’s final report. Hershbergpoints out, however, that attempting to prevent Galbraith’s appointment asHarvard professor had more to do with Galbraith’s liberal politics than hiswork on the Survey. Nevertheless it was Galbraith’s challenge to Cabot’sdraft report and his purported “intellectual dishonesty” that the Harvardboard used in 1949 to determine whether or not he would attain professor- ship. The result was a number of memorandums written by Galbraith in1949 that explained the controversy over the writing of the chairman’s final report as well as a series of letters between Galbraith and other Sur-vey directors that addressed the early September 1945 controversy. I will therefore rely on these documents heavily when discussing the controversyover the chairman’s final report. 77.Untitled and undated [remarks on exhibits for the appointment of Galbraith as professor of economics at Harvard, October 1949], box 70, Harvard University File, Galbraith Papers.

In one such session a represen-tative from the OSS, Hajo Holborn, presented his agency’s findingson the effects of bombing on German morale. But Louis Gottschalkwas concerned about the evidence that Holborn was presenting tothe committee. The historian argued that if his committee wasgoing to try and evaluate the effects of bombing on the enemy, thenthey needed “some notion of what it is that creates a fact and somenotion of how you measure that fact.” 58And the committee mem- bers realized that once they determined what exactly the facts were,they still would be unable to collect and analyze “all of the facts.”Since General Arnold had given them only about two months tocomplete their report, there simply was not enough time. 59 Not only did the historians chafe under the deadline imposed on them, they also had to deal with security restrictions on classifiedevidence. The chairman of the committee, Major Frank Monaghan,told the historians that there was no question concerning the “loy-alty, integrity or the discretion of any member.” But Monaghanpointed out to them that their evidence was still of a classified na-ture.

Instead the com-mittee played a “key role in both the study process and the final”GWAPS volumes by recommending analytical methods and by“identifying gaps in the overall project.” 49 The committee met formally in March 1992 and in January 1993 to review the work of the GWAPS. Bernard Lewis, a professor ofpolitical science at Princeton University, cautioned Eliot Cohen andhis task force leaders to maintain balance in their analysis by keep-ing “in mind that losers tend to study what went wrong while win-ners study what went right.” Another one of the review committee’scivilian scholars, Richard Kohn of the University of North Carolinaat Chapel Hill, advised the group that they needed to be very care-ful in the use of counterfactual speculation. Aware of the contro-versy over the USSBS’s counterfactual about Japan’s surrender atthe end of World War II, Kohn noted that it would be very difficultfor the GWAPS “to answer what if questions.” He doubted theycould assess events that did not happen. 50 There were retired senior military officers on the GWAPS review committee like General Michael J.

If the issue of morality was soimportant to naval officers, why did it not emerge before the 1949 supercarrier cancellation and defense budget reductions? By the late1950s, the navy was developing a strategic nuclear-tipped missilelaunched from submarines that would be predominantly used as anarea weapon against enemy cities. What happened to the moralityissue? Taking the longer view strongly suggests that the navy’s 1949 moral critique of the air force was only a tactic in the navy’s inter-service “war” to claim a larger share of the defense budget. 72 VI Admiral Ofstie, for example, about a year prior to the 1949 hear- ings, had no problem with “knock[ing] hell out of Moscow witha-bombs, budgets, and the dilemma of defense 154 Gentile, Gian P..

IV It is useful to compare the professional backgrounds of the USSBSanalysts with those of the GWAPS. Paul Nitze perceptively pointedout to GWAPS leaders at a review board meeting that the USSBS,“in its attempt to be independent, selected people who had no ex-pertise in the areas they were to study.” 38Nitze may have been get- ting at the lack of professional military experience of most of theUSSBS personnel, including himself. Of course one must acknowledge the historical context in which the USSBS conducted its evaluation. The reason why the USSBS hadvirtually no analysts with professional military backgrounds (savefor the professional military officers like Orvil Anderson and RalphOfstie) was that a defense establishment simply did not exist duringthe years leading up to World War II. Very few Americans served inthe armed services during the 1930s, so very few USSBS members would have had professional military service in their records. Moreimportant, the link between the military and academic institutionsfor research and development was only in its infancy during WorldWar II. When the GWAPS conducted its study in the early 1990s, a close institutional relationship between the military and civilian expertshad developed within the American defense establishment

Framing the questions that the Survey would answer and then setting up an organizational structure designed to answer thosequestions would indeed influence its conclusions. (Consider themarkedly different approach that General Arnold took when he al-lowed the Committee of Historians to evaluate the effects of strate-gic bombing without an established organization for its analysis.)But as General Arnold acknowledged in his memorandum to thepresident, the future of the AAF was bound up in the Survey’s re-sults, and therefore it had to have a strong aura of impartiality. Anaura was enough, however: the airmen never wanted the Survey toquestion the relevance of strategic bombing to military strategy. Survey director George Ball, in his memoirs, confirmed that the Survey’s “frame of reference” was limited to studying the effect ofthe American “air offensive on the Germany economy.” 38Paul Nitze would later point out that his and the Survey’s task in regardto strategic bombing “was to measure precisely the physical effectsand other effects as well, to put calipers on it. . . . I was trying to putquantitative numbers on something that was considered immeasur-able.” 39The Survey would be able to make imponderables ponder- able by limiting its analysis to the effectiveness of strategic bombingagainst German war-making capacity, exactly what the airmenwanted.

In early 1944, when they were forming the USSBS, Generals Arnold and Spaatz recognizedthat the USSBS must produce reports that would be perceived as“unbiased and completely impartial” if they were to be received fa-vorably. General Arnold himself understood how a report writtenby civilian experts could provide the “objective” historical recordneeded by the airmen in their future fight for independence. 27Al- though by 1991 the independence of the American air force was no longer in doubt as it was for General Arnold in 1944, the “future”was still dependent on an “objective” and “truthful” rendering ofthe air force’s performance in the Gulf War. Secretary Rice evidentlyunderstood this imperative and thus formed the civilian-led GulfWar Air Power Survey. When the GWAPS began its work in August 1991, director Eliot Cohen provided his team of analysts with a set of “guiding con-cepts” for their studies. The approach outlined by Cohen was “atall costs” to maintain a strong sense of “objectivity, honesty, [and]integrity.” Cohen drew on the “lineage” of the USSBS by emphasiz-ing what he saw as its “integrity” and presentation of work in“clear English.” Early on Cohen recognized the “symbolic ties” ofthe USSBS to the GWAPS. 28 Making the rhetorical connection from the GWAPS to the USSBS was much more than just symbolism. Throughout the early days ofthe GWAPS, and up through the writing of its final reports, refer-ences were often made to the need to be like the USSBS, especiallyin terms of “objectivity.” In April 1992, as the task forces were heavily engaged with the writing of their final reports, Eliot Cohentold Secretary Rice that he was using the USSBS as a model “interms of precision, pungency, and clarity.” 29In the foreword of eacha comparison of surveys 175 Gentile, Gian P..

The World War II United States Strategic Bombing Survey con- tains conclusions that have influenced scholars, strategists, andjournalists since its reports were first published in the two years fol-lowing the end of World War II. Analysts like Bernard Brodie and P.M. S. Blackett used the Survey’s conclusions and evidence to sup-port their ideas on nuclear strategy and postwar defense policy andorganization. The Survey’s findings also played a role in the post-war debate over President Truman’s decision to drop the atomicbombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Beginning with Karl Compton,Henry L. Stimson, Hanson Baldwin, and continuing up through atleast Herbert Feis and Gar Alperovitz and beyond, writers haveused portions of the Survey to support their position in the debateover the 1945 combat use of the bomb. Further, USSBS reports have supported various positions over President Richard Nixon’s bomb-ing of North Vietnam, and, much more recently, the application ofAmerican air power in the Gulf War and Kosovo. Because a presidential directive established the Survey and gave it an ofﬁcial status, and because the Survey was headed by civilians, os-tensibly making it impartial, the Survey reports have taken on theaura of a document that contains the truth about strategic bombing inWorld War II. In fact, the Survey is a secondary source that interprets the past: yet analysts and pundits who have used the Survey in theirpostwar writings have instead tended to treat it as a primary source.In criticizing such views, retired Air Force General Haywood Hansellonce cynically compared the Strategic Bombing Survey to the“Bible.” 5Yet as Clarence Darrow forced William Jennings Bryan to acknowledge in the famous 1925 Scopes trial, the Bible was only one of many truths that purported to explain the origins of man. And theSurvey contains the truth about the effects of strategic bombingintroduction

It is unclear why D’Olier did not try toresolve the apparent contradiction between Stimson’s and the Sur-vey’s explanation for Japan’s surrender. Back in December 1944 Franklin D’Olier gave a welcome speech to many of the Survey’s newly arrived analysts. He used a metaphorto explain to them his concept of strategic bombing. According toD’Olier, tactical bombing took off the arms and legs of the “cow,”but strategic bombing destroyed the whole “cow,” arms and legsand all. 103D’Olier’s Bombing Survey did its part to demonstrate that American strategic air power had slain the “cow” of Germanand Japanese war-making capacity during World War II. But in thePacific, the United States did it, according to the Survey, without theatomic bomb. In 1946– 47, that conclusion did not seem threatening to air power, to the sense of U.S. history, or to the military services. The Strategic Bombing Survey would continue to influence think- ing about strategic bombing and military strategy beyond the imme-diate post–World War II years. For example, Gar Alperovitz, in his1964 book Atomic Diplomacy , challenged Stimson’s official expla- nation of the A-bomb. Using Paul Nitze’s Pacific Survey counterfac-tual as evidence, Alperovitz argued that President Truman used thebomb not to end the war, because he knew that Japan would soonsurrender, but to intimidate the Soviet Union. 104In the early 1970s,a-bombs, budgets, and the dilemma of defense 165 Gentile, Gian P..

Admiral Of- stie told committee members that the United States was morallywrong for bombing civilians during World War II and Americanswould be equally immoral if they had to kill civilians in a war with theSoviet Union. According to the admiral, the American people were in“strong opposition to military methods [area bombings of cities] socontrary to our fundamental ideals.” 70 What was striking about the moral tack of the navy’s critique was that the majority of senior naval officers followed it. AdmiralRadford “condemned” the potential area bombing of Soviet citiesand did not “believe in [the] mass killing of noncombatants” basedon what he had learned since the war. Admiral Thomas Kinkaid re-ferred to the strategic bombing of Germany and Japan as “terroriz-ing bombardments” that violated established laws of war.
