Dennis Bilger of the Truman Presidential Library was the perfect “finding aide;” he somehow intuitively knew the documents that I needed to read.

Hershberg, in James B. Conant  (611-612), discusses it in the context of the 1949 attempt by the Harvard Board of Overseers (of which Cabot was a member) to block Galbraith’s appointment as professor. At issue, ostensibly, was Galbraith’s “intellectual dishonesty” when he challenged Cabot’s version of the Survey Chairman’s final report. Hershberg points out, however, that attempting to prevent Galbraith’s appointment as Harvard professor had more to do with Galbraith’s Liberal politics than his work on the Survey. Nevertheless it was Galbraith’s challenge to Cabot’s draft report and his purported “intellectual dishonesty” that the Harvard Board used in 1949 to determine whether or not he would attain professorship. The result was a number of memorandums written by Galbraith in 1949 that explained the controversy over the writing of the Chairman’s final report as well as a series of letters between Galbraith and other Survey Directors that addressed the early September 1945 controversy. I therefore rely heavily on these documents when discussing the controversy over the Chairman’s final report. 7 8  Untitled and Undated [Remarks on exhibits for the appointment of Galbraith as Economic Professor at Harvard, October 1949], Box 70, Galbraith Papers, Harvard University File, JFK Library.

Crane of the United States Military Academy (USMA) History Department who became a proxy-second reader and taught me a great deal about air power history . Colonel Robert A. Doughty, head of the USMA History Department, provided me with important advice and criticism along the way and with a semester off from teaching to complete the dissertation. Many others deserve mention. Colonel Judith A. Luckett was a role model for me in scholarship and leadership. Colonel Charles F. Brower IV read parts of the dissertation and taught me a great deal about teaching and historical analysis. From my first days as a graduate student at Stanford through three years of teaching history at West Point, Lieutenant Colonel Gary J. Tocchet has been a mentor and friend. My second reader at Stanford, Professor Gordon H. Chang, forced me to think about the dissertation as a whole and how to better tie the chapters together.

But the article concluded that certain methods o f bombing during World War II were quite effective. Bombing German transportation during World War II, according to “The Strategic Bombing Myth,” proved to be a “decisive factor in the collapse of the Germany Army.”6 4 Symington correctly pointed out in his testimony to the Congressmen that “The Strategic Bombing Myth” rested in large part on highly selected portions o f the Strategic Bombing Survey. He presented to the Committee a letter written by former Survey Chairman Franklin D’Olier that argued that the “Strategic Bombing Myth” grossly misstated the major conclusions of the Survey.6 5  Explicitly, the Secretary sought to attack the credibility o f the article, but he had ulterior motives as well. The naval officers who appeared prior to Secretary Symington had relied largely on the Survey to attack Air Force methods of strategic air warfare. By attacking the use of the Survey in extreme form (“The Strategic Bombing Myth” and the Tatom testimony) Secretary Symington hoped to place doubt in the minds of committee members about the Navy’s use of the Survey in preceding and subsequent testimony. 6 4  [Author Unknown], “The Strategic Bombing Myth,” [Summer 1949], Box 6, Symingto

Admiral Ofstie told Committee members that the United States was morally wrong for bombing civilians during World War II and Americans would be equally immoral if they had to kill civilians in a war with the Soviet Union. According to the Admiral, the American people were in “strong opposition to military methods [area bombings of cities] so contrary to our fundamental ideals.”7 1 What was striking about the moral tack of the Navy’s critique was that the majority of senior naval officers followed it. Admiral Radford “condemned” the potential area bombing of Soviet cities and did not “believe in [the] mass killing of noncombatants” based on what he had learned since the war.

If the issue of morality was so important to Naval officers, why did it not emerge before the 1949 supercarrier cancellation and defense budget reductions? By the late 1950s, the Navy was developing a strategic nuclear-tipped missile launched from submarines that would be predominantly used as an area weapon against enemy cities. What happened to the morality issue? Taking the longer view strongly suggests that the Navy’s 1949 moral critique of the Air Force was only a t

Ill A troubling tendency in post-1945 writings on strategic bombing in World War II has been the conflation of the term area bombing (or, area attacks, area raids, fire bombing, fire raids) with the term morale bombing (or, terror bombing, terror attacks, morale attacks).

An after- action-review of Operation Clarion, (a late February 1945 operation conducted by the AAF to disrupt German transportation facilities, oil supplies, and possibly precipitate a “crisis” among railway workers), cautioned that there was no evidence “that the attacks broke the morale and economy.

In a widely read 1947 article in Harper’ s Magazine  (actually authored by his young aide, McGeorge Bundy, whose role was not revealed at the time), Stimson cited the Survey report, Japan s Struggle to End the War,  and concluded: “All the evidence  I have seen indicates that the controlling factor in the final Japanese decision to accept our terms of surrender was the atomic bomb.”1 0 Stimson’s statement is an early example of how conclusions drawn from the narrative portion of Japan’ s Struggle to End the War  could be much different from the ending portion o f the report which stated verbatim (from the Summary Report)  Nitze’s early- surrender counterfactual. But for Stimson, the narrative in Japan's Struggle to End the War,  by itself, indicated that the Japanese cabinet was deadlocked over whether to accept the Potsdam terms or continue the war in August 1945, and thus the atom bomb made the decisive difference. Unlike the Survey, Stimson concluded from the narrative that the United States had to drop the bomb to end the war quickly and save American lives. Stimson, though, did not explicitly seek to rebut the Survey’s “official” explanation (even though Stimson’s explanation contradicted Nitze’s counterfactual conclusion) for Japan’s surrender.

D’Olier would not make any meaningful intellectual contributions to the Survey’s work.

After the experience that General Arnold and Edward Mead Earle had with the Committee of Historians in late 1943, it was no wonder that historians were not considered for positions on the Survey’s staff (except for the Survey’s chronicler, Major James Beveridge). Instead the Survey sought experts who had experience “in economic research and analysis, and with either a college background indicating work in this

D’Olier, 80according to Maclsaac, did his best to be “fair.” But the record strongly suggests that D’Olier deliberately sided with Anderson and allowed Air Campaigns  to be published in the face of objections by Ofstie and Paul Nitze. In early 1946, Ofstie’s Division wrote a report, “The Air Effort Against Japan,” (this was a different study from Campaigns o f the Pacific War  discussed above) that described 7 8  Maclsaac, Strategic Bombing in World War II,  133. 7 9  Ibid., 122. 80 Ibid., Maclsaac has the word “fair” set off in quotation marks so one can assume that D’Olier used the word at some point, although it is hard to tell from Maclsaac’s notes. 166 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

Yet when Ofstie submitted the galleys of this report for review, Nitze considered it not to be “an impartial or accurate account of the air effort against Japan.” The Survey, said Nitze, “would not approve of its publication in its present form which incorrectly associates the Survey with it.”8 1 Ofstie’s report argued that U.S. naval action in World War II in the Pacific “played the principal as well as the deciding part.” The report concluded that “too much has been said of late of the peculiar and distinctive nature of airpower, and too little of its necessary 82interrelation with land and sea forces for whose benefit it exists.” Major General Launs Norstad, who had probably been briefed about the Naval Analysis Division’s report by Anderson, was worried that the report claimed to be an analysis of the overall air effort against Japan, but was really a highly biased description of the navy’s carrier based air effort. As a result o f these expressed concerns, and Nitze’s desire to maintain “impartiality,” the Survey did not publish the report. But Ofstie did get l

Franklin D’Olier knew that Nitze’s Pacific Survey’s counterfactual conclusion raised troubling questions about the end of World War II in the Pacific. Shortly after Harper’ s Magazine  published Henry Stimson’s article on President Truman’s decision to use the bomb, University o f Chicago theologian Fred Eastman told D’Olier that he was “struck by the difference between “the two explanations for Japan’s surrender.” Eastman wondered if Stimson had read the Pacific Survey report (that argued the bomb was unnecessary) “before [Stimson] wrote his article?” D’Olier informed Eastman that he had never read Stimson's article.1 2  D’Olier chose not to confront the two contradictory statements concerning Japan’s surrender and the necessity of the atomic bomb. Instead, he simply provided Eastman with a restatement of the presidential directives that established the Survey. It is unclear why D’Olier did not try to resolve the apparent contradiction between Stimson’s and the Survey’s explanation for Japan’s surrender. Back in December 1944 Franklin D’Olier gave a welcome speech to many of the Survey’s newly arrived analysts. He used a metaphor to explain to them his concept of strategic bombing. According to D’Olier, tactical bombing took off the arms and legs of the “cow,” but strategic bombing destroyed the whole “cow,” arms and legs and all.1 3 1 1  Barton J.

They included some of America’s leading historians in the fields of American and European history: Carl L. Becker, professor of European history at Cornell University; Henry S. Commager, professor of American and European history at Columbia University; Edward Mead Earle, member of the COA, special AAF advisor, and scholar at The Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton University; Louis Gottschalk and Bemadotte Schmitt, professors of history at the University of Chicago; and Dumas Malone of Harvard University.3 2 Their report, “Germany’s War Potential, December 1943: An Appraisal,” was different in its analytical approach and assumptions from those written by groups like the COA that preceded it and from ones like the Strategic Bombing Survey that would follow.

The committee was acutely aware of various inadequacies and gaps in the information the members would greatly like to have had. The members recognize that there are intangibles and imponderables in war which cannot be assessed but which may be more nearly decisive than any of the purely military, economic, or psychological factors now apparent. Not all the truth can be discerned in even the best intelligence reports, since we always operate through the ‘fog o f war.’”3 4 Here the historians were apparently distinguishing themselves from the industrial experts that predominantly made up the other target selection and evaluation agencies. Historians, by nature, usually allow for complexity and uncertainty in their analysis: When can the historian ever collect “all” the evidence on a given historical problem? Physical scientists, conversely, operate differently in that “all” the facts~or at least all the necessary representative facts— pertaining to a given line of inquiry can usually be gathered and systematic conclusions can thus follow based on those facts.3 3  The Committee of Historians seem to have been suggesting to General Arnold that the nature of modem war using strategic bombers was filled with imponderables which could “not be assessed.” The historians acknowledged that they could evaluate the effects of strategic bombing on certain German economic, military and political factors. Yet they also realized that the relationship between cause and effect in war (in their report the cause being strategic bombing attacks on Germany and the effect being Germany’s 5 3  Memo from Arnold to the President, 27 January 1944, Box 164, Map Room Files, FDR L
