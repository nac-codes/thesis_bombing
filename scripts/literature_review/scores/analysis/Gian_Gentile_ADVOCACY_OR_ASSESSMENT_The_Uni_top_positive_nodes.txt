During the October 1945 congressional hearings many top civilian and military leaders appeared before the Committee to explain their positions on unification. Even though the Pacific portion of the Strategic Bombing Survey was still ongoing, some of its draft reports had made their way back to Washington along with the many completed reports from the European Survey. When arguing either in favor of, or against, unification, military leaders would often use reports from the Survey as proof of their services’  accomplishments during the war. Proving which service played the decisive role in victory was closely linked to arguments over the future structure of the postwar defense establishment. Vice Admiral Dewitt C.

Bond’s letter was written on the National Fire Protection Association’s official stationary. At the very top of the letter appears the Association’s statement o f purpose: “To promote the science and improve the methods o f fire protection and prevention: to obtain and circulate information on those subjects and to secure the co-operation o f its members in establishing proper safeguards against loss of life and property by fire.” u In the ensuing text of the letter, Bond, the civilian expert on fire protection, was of course not recommending to the COA methods to save lives and property in Japan, but methods to destroy buildings and kill people. It is doubtful whether Bond, Perera, or other members of the COA ever noticed this striking juxtaposition in what was judged a just war against a hated enemy. In one of their final reports to General Arnold, the COA submitted in October 1944 an air plan to defeat Japan by “aerial and naval blockade and bombardment from present and future bases.” The COA’s plan based its recommendations on the assumption that Japan could be defeated without a land invasion. The plan listed aircraft production, urban industrial areas, and Japanese shipping as the most promising targets. Japanese “urban areas,” argued the Committee,

The COA noted that the “frame- built cities of Japan are highly combustible and can be more readily destroyed than the massive-built cities of Germany.” The Committee’s only question was “how much more readily they” could be destroyed. Their answer was to choose the most effective bombs and “modes” of delivering those bombs.1 0  Another analysis by the Committee provided further information on the potential of fire raids by emphasizing that the “sustaining sources o f Japanese military strength” could best be damaged by strategic bombing operations against air craft production, coke factories, petroleum, radios and radar, ball­ bearings, and “urban industrial areas.” The report argued that “urban industrial areas” as an objective were vulnerable to the area bombing “technique” and night attack.1 1 The COA often drew on the expertise of individuals outside the War Department.

Because the Japanese economy was different from Germany’s in that Japan’s represented “an island industrial core which derive[d] its material largely from overseas,” an attack against shipping and coke for steel production would have a powerful effect on “the entire structure of Japanese industry.”3  This early COA report did not recommend using incendiary attacks against Japanese cities to destroy war industry. But the vulnerability of Japanese cities, constructed largely out of wood, to fire was widely understood. As early as 1939, the Air Corps Tactical School had informed its students about the combustible nature of Japan’s major industrial cities. In February 1942, General Arnold had his staff prepare target analyses that highlighted the vulnerability of Japanese cities to fire.

In March 1949, the newly appointed Secretary of Defense, Louis Johnson, canceled production of the Navy’s cherished supercarrier, the USS United States. The Navy responded with a deliberate attack on the strategic vision and performance capability of the Air Force’s newest bomber, the B-36. In the midst of this service battle over future weapon systems, President Truman announced in August 1949 the reduction of the 1951 fiscal year defense budget to 13 billion dollars, about 2 billion less than the services had originally planned.5 4 With representative Carl Vinson as Chairman, the House Armed Services Committee opened the B-36 hearings in August 1949. The air officers who testified naturally wished to disprove the charges that the B-36 was not the most economical bomber for the defense dollar and further to establish the efficacy of their method of strategic bombing in the postwar world. The atomic bomb and the Air Force’s ability to deliver it was an important part of the Air Force’s case to Congress.

According to Ball, Speer predicted that if the Allies had “continued those attacks, knocking Hamburg completely out of the war, German morale... would have suffered a critical blow.”2 4  Ruminating years later on the interrogation, Ball considered Speer’s “insights” on the potential decisiveness of area attacks on morale to be “curious [and] fascinating.”2 5 The implications of Speer’s testimony about Hamburg were in fact quite profound.

Eisenhower, reluctantly diverted his bombers from strategic attacks on the German war economy to tactical bombing against local railroad facilities in France to support the Normandy landings. Once the Allied forces had established themselves on the continent, the AAF again concentrated its strategic bombers against Germany. But because of the experience gained by using its bombers to attack railroads in France as a part of the Normandy invasion, the AAF saw value in strategic attacks against transportation targets inside of Germany.7 0 Survey analysts accepted the notion that strategic bombers should attack basic industries that linked together the enemy’s war economy. Moreover, it was logical for the

The B-36 Hearings ended in late August 1949, but Committee Chairman Carl Vinson, responding to complaints from Naval officers that they did not get a chance to present their side of the story, reopened the hearings on 5 October to hear Navy testimony on strategic air power and naval aviation.3 9  One of the more junior naval officers to testily was Commander Eugene Tatom, head o f the Navy’s aviation ordnance branch. On 10 October, Commander Tatom made an unbelievable assertion about the destructive qualities of the atom bomb. Tatom told the Committee that an individual “could stand in the open at one end o f the north-south runway at the Washington National Airport, with no more protection than the clothes you now have on, and have an atom bomb explode at Vandenberg was referring to see P.M.S.

The targets contained in the “industrial concentrations” could be attacked with incendiary or precision bombing, depending on operational and target factors. Area attacks, therefore, were a method, like precision bombing, to destroy the war industry in Japan’s largest cities. The Group realized that area attacks would kill “workers.” But causing terror was not the primary purpose of area attacks, according to the JTG. Instead area attacks would produce industrial loss consisting “of direct damage to factories and their equipment...and of time lost by workers through the disorganizing effects of de-housing, casualties, disruption of utilities services, and general administrative disorganization.” 1 9 A major recipient of the JTG’s analyses was Brigadier General Haywood Hansell’s XXI Bomber Command. The XXI had been flying bombing missions against Japan out of Tinian Island, in the Mariana chain, since November 1944. Hansell’s command conducted mostly precision bombing missions against specific Japanese industrial targets. As a former instructor at the Air Corps Tactical School and an architect of precision bombing doctrine, Hansell felt that he could effectively attack Japanese war-making capacity using precision bombing methods.2 0 1 8  Joint Target Group, “Japanese Urban Areas: Ge

The Survey, argued Admiral Ramsey, would “set forth in the record...that the Navy has measured up to the confidence reposed in it by the American people in spelling doom for the Japanese dreams of conquest long before the first atomic bomb descended on Hiroshima.”7 General Spaatz also appeared before the committee to provide his opinions on unification. In his testimony he used key passages from the Survey as justification for the Air Force’s postwar plans for air power. An often used passage from the European Survey’s Summary Report  states that “Allied air power was decisive in the war in western Europe.”8  General Spaatz quoted this passage to committee members when explaining the crucial role the AAF played in producing victory in the war in Europe. But unlike Admiral Ramsey who dwelled extensively on wartime accomplishments, General Spaatz quickly moved the discussion toward the future role of airpower: The plain fact is that coasts and seas no longer have their old significance for defense. Distance has been telescoped...In the air power age the Air Force is vitally concerned with the development of jet propulsion, supersonic speeds, guided missiles; not to speak of the potentials of harnessed atomic energy. The Air Force should be free from control by interests which may be influenced more by things of the past or present than by ideas for, and of, the future. 6  Statement of Vice Admiral Dewitt C.

File: --- gentile_advocacy.pdf --- Page 155 --- Nitze’s 12 March preliminary draft pointed out that high level bombing conducted by the AAF against Japanese shipping did not produce favorable results. The draft argued that “the accuracy of high level bombing against maneuvering ships was so low as to give disappointing results with the limited forces available.” Although acknowledging that the AAF was only able to apply “limited forces,” the draft still emphasized that high level bombing was ineffective.2 9  The 1  July published version of the Summary Report  omitted this criticism of the AAF. The published Summary Report  also deleted some favorable statements made in earlier drafts about the importance of American carrier based aircraft. A March outline of the report argued that the United States had “underestimated the ability of carrier-based air to neutralize Japanese land based air.”30 The published Summary Report acknowledged that the loss of the “antiquated battleships at Pearl Harbor had little effect on the [American] Navy’s combat capabilities,” but it did not give credit to the Navy for destroying Japan’s land based air force, as the ea
