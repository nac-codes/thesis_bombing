Compounding this problem for the Americans and British was the reality that neither had the strength to mount sustained operations that could inflict telling cumulative damage, while bad weather, over Britain or Germany, imposed its own restrictions upon the conduct of opera-tions. Moreover, both the Americans and British were prevented frommounting successive follow-up attacks because of the need to switchtargets in order to preserve tactical surprise. This became increasinglyimportant with respect to deep-penetration operations as the scale and effectiveness of German defences grew during the course of 1943. By September 1943 a front-line strength of some 500 day and 350 nightfighters (plus over 33,400 flak guns) had been concentrated by theLuftwaffe in defence of German airspace, and it was around this time that the German daylight effort peaked with a series of battles that endedwith the 8th Air Force temporarily admitting defeat. The two most important single battles were fought on 17 August and 14 October, the first resulting in the 8th Air Force losing sixty-fourheavy bombers and having another 168 damaged from the total of 376sent against the ball-bearing factories at Schweinfurt and the aircraft plantsat Regensburg while another sixty-seven were lost and 138 were dam-aged in the October raid on Emden and Schweinfurt by 320 aircraft.

Spitfires to provide its bomb- ers with cover as far as the German border: thereafter the P-47B Thunder- bolt was added to the supporting cast and escorted American bombersover western Germany.  After July 1943, with the appearance of the P-47Cand drop tanks for both Lightnings and Thunderbolts, American fightersoperated ever deeper into Germany in defence of the heavy bombers,and the German switch from forward to in-depth defence was partially a response to this development. But while the later Thunderbolts were able to escort the strategic bombers as far as Berlin their overall perfor-mance was inferior to that of the Fw 190/Ta 152, the mainstay of theGerman daylight defensive effort. On 1 December, however, the first P-51B Mustangs arrived in Britain for service with the 8th Air Force, andafter flying operationally in Europe for the first time on the thirteenth this aircraft proved that it could do battle with an Fw 190 over Berlin on better than equal terms. Moreover, at this same time, with the 8th AirForce in Britain and the 15th Air Force in Italy brought under a singlecommand in order to subject Germany to coordinated American attacks,the Americans were able to commit their growing numbers of fightersnot simply to the defence of the heavy bombers but to seeking out Ger- man fighters across the whole of Germany.

DEFEAT OF U-BOATS, 1943–1944 The attacks of April 1943 plus the German refusal to believe that the Allies had been able to develop airborne centimetric radar led the U- boat command into a series of operational mistakes over the spring months. Initially, night crossings of the Bay of Biscay were abandonedand submarines were ordered to run on the surface in daylight in orderto recharge batteries, but when this resulted only in increased contactswith, and losses to, Allied aircraft the German response was to order U-boats first to stay on the surface and fight their attackers and then to sail in company for mutual protection. With the summer came increased anti- aircraft armament for submarines and, ironically, a system of convoyingU-boats across the Bay of Biscay by surface and air escorts, but centimetricradar, shallow-set depth charges and later rocket projectiles for use againstsurfaced U-boats provided Allied aircraft with a decisive superiority overGerman submarines throughout the summer of 1943.

First, in June 1941 the R.A.F . began a series of daylight raids over the Pas de Calaisdesigned to force the Luftwaffe into a defensive battle that it would lose. In reality, the Luftwaffe had the option not to be thus drawn because none of the R.A.F . targets warranted its commitment, and on those occa-sions when it did fight the superiority of the defence was reaffirmed. Moreover, the R.A.F . found to its surprise that the Spitfire Mark V was outclassed by the new Messerschmitt Bf 109F .

By September 1941, with the nights beginning to draw in, day- light operations clearly presented the R.A.F . with no credible alternative to a strategic bombing offensive.

The lateness of British rearmament meant that the R.A.F .  couldnot come into possession of a sizeable heavy bomber force until 1942, and Bomber Command began the war with just thirty-three squadrons, seventeen of which were equipped with Battle and Blenheim light bomb-ers which were incapable of making an effective contribution to a strate-gic air offensive.

Failure to defeat the Soviet Union in 1941 along with the disruption of training programmes had serious long-term implications for the Luftwaffe that were compounded in 1942 by a refusal to credit declared American intentions with respect to future air-craft construction.

Equally important, but outsidethe convoy battles, patrol aircraft also accounted for nine U-boats in May.Such patrols were generally unrewarding during the war, though theydid account for twelve U-boats in the first four months of 1943, but at the end of April a series of night attacks on German submarines crossing the Bay of Biscay convinced the U-boat command that Allied aircraft wereable to locate surfaced submarines from transmissions from their Naxossearch receivers.

Had it known the extent and scale of Soviet defences around and behind Kursk the German high command would probably never havecommitted itself to this offensive. Indeed, long before 1 July, when Hitler finally ordered the attack to proceed, certain of his senior commanders suspected that successive postponements of the offensive had given theSoviet army so much time to prepare to meet the attack that the Germaneffort was doomed to failure. In fact, by the time that the German attackbegan on the fifth the Soviet army had prepared eight defensive beltscovering the southern approaches to Kursk and the entire Soviet defen- sive network extended over a depth of 120 miles with the positions oc- cupied by the Steppe Front, in reserve behind the salient, fortified thoughnot on the scale of those held by the Central and Voronezh Fronts within the salient itself.

Aircraft from escort carriers sank forty-one U-boats in the course of the war and shared another seventeen with surface escorts andshore- based aircraft, but their main achievement was in providing recon- naissance and contacts for escorts, and also in denying German subma-rines the ability to track and gather around a convoy without risk ofattack.  As more escort carriers became available German submarines lost the twin abilities to wait until a convoy drew beyond the range of shore-based aircraft before mounting attacks and to run on the surface inmid-ocean with impunity. Similarly, the intervention of VLR Liberatorseroded these abilities which, by spring 1943, were two of the last tacticaladvantages remaining to German submarines.

In these circum-stances the extent of German losses at Kursk assumed its full significance.By 23 August the corps strengths of the 1st Panzer Army had been re- duced to 5,800 men as a result of the Mius battle while by 7 September,at a time when the effective strength of infantry divisions seeking to gain the protection of the Dnepr was down to a thousand rifles, Army Group South had been reduced to 257  tanks and 220 assault guns, less than one- third of the establishment with which it began its drive on Kursk just two months before. In trying to piece together an effective defence of the Ukraine in the second half of 1943 the Wehrmacht was thus beset by long-term structural and leadership problems that reflected the accumulating diffi-culties of Germany as a whole as the tide of war turned against the Axispowers, but the Wehrmacht nevertheless was to benefit from two devel- opments. The teething and maintenance problems that had attended theintroduction of a new generation of tanks and assault guns into wide-spread service in the first half of the year eased with the passing of time, and the German ability in the autumn of 1943 to master the situation in Italy—at least in defensive terms—meant that after September the Italiantheatre did not siphon off German strength on the Eastern Front.

AIR POWER ON THE EASTERN FRONT By mid-1943 the Soviet air force had raised one air army for each of the army’s thirteen fronts plus a further nineteen air corps, with a total of2,600 combat aircraft, that could be used to reinforce air armies for the duration of specific operations. The result was that whereas throughout1942 Soviet air armies seldom mustered more than 350 aircraft, by mid-1943 main sector air armies had as many as a thousand aircraft undercommand. At the outset of the battle of Kursk, for example, the two airarmies with the Central and Voronezh Fronts possessed 1,915 combat aircraft, and were supported by two more air armies, of roughly similar size, in the reserve role. Despite such numbers, however, the Soviet airforce was unable to achieve air superiority over Kursk and both sideswere able to mount punishing attacks on enemy armour in the course ofthe battle. While Western attention had fixed on the disastrous Sovietattempt to mount a pre-emptive attack on German airfields on the morn- ing of 5 July the fact remains that the air battles over Kursk in July came EBSCOhost - printed on 10/6/2024 9:23 PM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

By 11July, however, the 4th Panzer Army had broken through no fewer than five defensive belts and Army Detachment Kempf (later re-designated the 8th Army ) had come abreast of the 4th Panzer Army for the first time since the battle began. It was on this day that formations from the 4th Panzer Army launched attacks that resulted, on the twelfth, in the most famous single part of the battle of Kursk, the action around Prokhorovka in which approximately 600 German and 900 Soviet tanksdid battle over an area measuring some three miles by four. This singleday’s action cost the Germans about 300 tanks, the Soviets perhaps asmany as 500, but while the 4th Panzer Army remained holding the battle- field and Army Detachment Kempf by nightfall on 13 July, had fought its way forward to trap parts of the 5th Guards Tank and 5th Guards Armiesas they withdrew from Prokhorovka, the German losses in this engage-ment, combined with developments elsewhere, effectively spelt an endto the German offensive though it was not until 19 July that 0.K.W .  tacitly admitted that the attack had failed. The most obvious of these developments, and the one usually cited in Western histories as critical in Hitler’s decision to end the offensive,was the Anglo-American invasion of Sicily on 10 July, but while this de-velopment was give

The U-boat service, on the other hand, survived its defeat of May 1943 because of its numbers, but it could not respond quickly and effec- tively to the various technological changes that rendered its standardType VIIC and Type IX boats obsolete. Indeed, by 1943 the submarine, asit had evolved since 1897, had reached the limits of its development, and what Germany needed was a proper submarine of good underwater per- formance, not a submersible. In 1943, however, the planned Walter boatswere some three years from entering service, and approval for the con-struction of two interim classes, the Types XXI and XXIII, was not givenuntil 8 August. By the time that the lead boats were accepted into servicein June 1944 Germany’s defeat at sea could not be reversed, and some- what appropriately the first operational mission of an oceanic Type XXI boat began on the day of Hitler’s suicide. ASPECTS OF GERMAN DEFEAT AT SEA In order to continue the war at sea after mid-1943 the U-boat com- mand adopted three measures: the commitment of U-boats to distant waters, specifically off southern Africa and in the Indian Ocean; the intro- duction of submarine snorkel breathing apparatus that enabled a subma-rine to recharge its batteries while submerged; and the introduction of anumber of new weapons, most notably the T4 and T5 acoustic torpedoes.None of these proved more than palliatives. No amount of success indistant waters could compensate for defeat in the North Atlantic, and German success in the Indian Ocean lasted no longer than it took to EBSCOhost - printed on 10/6/2024 9:23 PM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

July–September 1943 was one ofthe very few quarters during the Second World War when the Luftwaffe ’s overall and operational strengths declined, and by more than a thousandaircraft. To this decline, at a crucial stage of the air war with the American bombing effort about to increase significantly in scale and tempo, Soviet tactical air power made its full contribution, though not to the extent ofthe 1,500 air victories claimed in Soviet accounts of Kursk. The Sovietclaim that Anglo-American forces ‘landed in France in 1944 without muchopposition from the Luftwaffe chiefly because the bulk of its forces had been smashed on the Soviet–German front the year before’ is overstated. Given the fact that the Anglo-American combined bombing offensive is rightly seen as crucial in the process whereby the Allies secured tacticalair superiority over all fronts, events on the Eastern Front in that yearprovide an important corrective in noting the importance of tactical airpower—and not just on the Eastern Front—in the progressive weaken-ing of the Luftwaffe during 1943. Most certainly the operations over Orel in July and August 1943 were the last occasion when the Luftwaffe was able to mount an effort with major repercussions on the course of opera-tions on the ground: thereafter its dissipation and declining quality ren-dered it no more than an increasingly ineffective tactical response to alost strategic situation. DECLINE OF BLITZKRIEG Leaving aside aviation matters, Kursk’s significance was profound, most obviously in terms of the erosion of

On 18 December, in a raid that involved no real penetration ofGerman air space, radar-directed fighters accounted for twelve of the twenty-two Wellingtons sent against warships in the Jade Roads and at Wilhelmshaven. Daylight operations between September and December1939 cost R.A.F . Bomber Command thirty-one of the 163 aircraft thusdespatched. R.A.F .  PRIORITIES SET Before the war Bomber Command had calculated that 5 per cent losses represented the maximum that could be sustained without a de-cline of operational effectiveness.  After the 18 December raid its day-light operations were curtailed drastically and emphasis was placed uponnight operations. In the winter of 1939–1940 these consisted of drop-ping propaganda leaflets rather than high explosives on German cities, but in that losses during such missions to enemy action were very few and overall losses totalled only 2.8 per cent lay an obvious conclusionthat R.A.F . Bomber Command could not and did not ignore. When theGerman attack in the west began so, too, did Bomber Command’s nightoffensive against German cities.  The first British raid in a campaign thatwas to last almost five years was mounted on the night of 14–15 May 1940 against communications and military targets in the Ruhr. Involvement in the fighting in the Low Countries and northern France in May and June 1940 prevented Bomber Command from devel- oping strategic operations in these months, and in the summer weeksthat followed its main efforts were directed against aircraft and alu-minium factories in western Germany and shipping concentrated in Ger- man and Channel ports for the proposed invasion of southern England.
