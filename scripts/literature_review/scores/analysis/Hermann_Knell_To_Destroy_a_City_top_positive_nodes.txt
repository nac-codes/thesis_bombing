Harris even laid on a raid on the ball-bearing town of Schweinfurt with 734 sorties on 24-25 February 1944. The Eighth had pummeled the town the day before with 266 B-17s, but this time under long-range fighter escort, probably P-51 Mustangs available since December 1943, to avoid a repeat of the disaster of 17 August 1943. Harris was right, the Schweinfurt raid was not a success.180 Other cities hit were Leipzig twice, Stuttgart three times, and Frankfurt four times. All of these raids were major operations causing sub- stantial damage but also losses to Bomber Command. The worst raid was on Nürnberg on the moonlit night of 30-31 March 1944 in which 795 bombers participated and 95 were lost, 11.9 percent of the force dispatched. It was a controversial raid, not only because it caused little damage to Nürnberg, but because there was suspicion that the Luftwaffe fighters had been tipped off.181 Was there a mole at High Wycombe? During the period of November 1943 to 31 March 1944, the RAF bombers had flown about 29,500 night sorties delivering about 78,500 tons of bombs on targets in Western Europe and losing 1,117 aircraft in the process.182 In January 1943, during the Baedeker Raids on Britain, the BBC German broadcast had warned us that for every pound dropped by German planes, British bombers would drop one ton.183 The Baby Blitz had dropped 2,000 tons on Britain in four months. The 78,500 tons dropped by Bomber Command at about the same time do not come anywhere near the figure of 4 million, as extrapolation of this boast would indicate. Allied planning for storming the shores of Western Europe had taken concrete forms by early 1944. It had become obvious that Germany was not to be defeated with the available bomber forces. Neither the RAF nor the Eighth USAAF had enough resources to bomb German centers continually. The report prepared by the Air Ministry on 22 September 1942, predicting that 4,000 bombers attacking f

On 17 August 1943 the Schweinfurt ball-bearing factories and the fighter factories at Regensburg were the targets. The targets were damaged, but of the 376 planes dispatched, 60 did not return, and many of of the ones that did make it home were beyond repair. It was an expensive lesson as 550 air crew were either killed or captured.170 O . One plane fell in a built-up area of Würzburg, killing the crew but causing no losses among the inhabitants. Schweinfurt, located only forty kilometers north- east of Würzburg, brought the bombing war closer to us and we hurried to the air-raid shelters from then on whenever a daytime alarm was sounded. Before that nobody had paid much attention. These two raids brought to an end the U.S. doctrine of self- defending bomber formations. It is not reported, but the RAF bomber commanders must have said: "We told you so." What was badly needed was a long-range fighter plane that could accompany the bombers on their daytime missions and ward off the increasing number of German fighters. The Pointblank Directive indicated that the German fighter defense might number three thousand planes by 1943. The directive also stressed as one of the principal targets the German aircraft industry. This implied but did not spell out in so many words that air superiority was the key to the success of the directive. The experts should have read Douhet's book. As it turned out German fighter numbers increased dramatically. In 1943 over nine thousand single-engine fighters were produced.171 T

Although he had received come reinforcements, this campaign, like the original Blitz and the Baedeker Raids, faltered and had to be abandoned because of unsustainable losses. The order of battle of Luftflotte 3 had been reduced to 144 bombers. For the third time proof had been brought that the Luftwaffe was not a strategic weapon. Hitler, Göring, and the Luftwaffe staff took the lesson and practically abandoned strategic bombing, a type of warfare they had never understood or mastered, as compared with the Trenchard-trained Britons and the Americans who imitated them later. German planning now concentrated on the defense of the Reich and, despite the damage to many aircraft factories, the production of fighters soared to unprecedented heights. Under Speer, fighter production was standardized, materi- als were allotted, and the total war syndrome finally caught up with German industry by introducing double shifting. Single- engine fighter production rose to 25,800 by the end of 1944, a figure which was not expected by the Allied war planners.177 While Peltz's bombers tried to make an impression, Harris initiated his biggest and costliest campaign of the war. The bat- tle of Berlin had been started on 18-19 November 1943 when 440 Lancasters were dispatched. It was only a limited success because the city was covered by clouds, its location was beyond the range of OBOE, and the Pathfinders had made scattered markings.

There were experimental radars (one of them called the "Würzburg" for some unfathomable reason), with a maximum range of forty miles. There was no tie-in to the fighter squadrons. The German fighter formations were not specifically organized to defend the Reich. Their main task, as for the rest of the Luftwaffe, was to provide tactical support for the army. All major nations had modern fighters by 1940-41 in the following numbers: France, 400; Italy, 150; Japan, 500. Facing each other at the start of the battle of Britain were: the Royal Air Force, 600; the Luftwaffe, 820.6 These aircraft were single-engine monoplanes, which could reach speeds up to 400 miles per hour, could climb up to 20,000 feet within five to six minutes, and had up to eight machine guns mounted in fixed positions in their wings. Their ceilings were maximum 40,000 feet, i.e. about 10,000 feet higher than any bomber could climb.7 They were praised for certain fea- tures, which supposedly made them superior to other designs and which were played up by the media during the war. The Japanese Zero fighter had great maneuverability, but lacked armor plate to protect the pilot, and its fuel tanks were not rub- ber lined (self-sealing). A tracer bullet penetrating into the fuel tank made it blow up. The first Spitfires had only .303" machine guns, whereas the first Messerschmitt Me-109 had three 20mm cannons. The Spitfires could turn more easily, but when the shells of the Me-109 hit there was considerable destruction. In other words, there were limitations in design which could not be overcome without reducing another feature. As the war progressed, improvements were made to make fighters more effective.

He became a commissioned infantry officer in 1904, but changed to the Fliegertruppe in World War I. Discharged after the war he was called back in 1935 and made a general of the Luftwaffe. He commanded the Condor Legion in 1936 and 1937 and in 1939 was put in charge of Luftflotte 3. After the fall of France in 1940, he was promoted to field marshal and con- tinued to command Luftflotte 3, which participated in the bat- tle of Britain, the Blitz, and the Baedeker Raids.

In 1948 he was tried for war crimes and declared inno- cent. He died at Landsberg on 2 April 1953.42 The other German bomber commander was Albert Kesselring. He was born at Marktsteft, a dozen miles south of Würzburg, on 31 November 1885. His roots were solidly plant- ed in southern Germany.43 In 1904 he became a commissioned officer in an artillery regiment at Metz, which was then German territory. After the war he stayed with the army until 1933 when he was transferred to the Luftwaffe. He became chief of staff and helped build up that service. When World War II broke out he took over command of Luftflotte 1, which participated in the Polish campaign, and as such he was involved in the bombing of Warsaw. In 1940 he was put in command of Luftflotte 2, which, together with Sperrle's Luft- flotte 3 and the smaller Luftflotte 5 based in Norway, attacked Britain.

Most of the army and navy air forces's fighters were engaged at the perimeter of Japanese military operations. It almost appears that neither service saw its duty to be to defend the home islands. What fighters there were stationed at home could not fly high enough to engage the B-29s. Similarly, most Japanese flak could not reach the operating height of the B-29 bombers. South of Japan there were few locations available for early warning radar installations. Iwo Jima and the Bonin Islands were the only ones, but were lost during the USAAF bombing campaign. Coordination between radar operations and mili- tary and civil defense was poor. When the XXI USAAF Bomber Command raids began in late 1944, Japan had only five hun- dred dayfighters and about fifty nightfighters to defend the home islands.12 As the antiaircraft guns became more sophisticated, the bombers were forced to unload from greater heights. Their accuracy in hitting targets decreased, and surrounding areas were subjected to damage. It was a fact the bomber generals 277 and marshals did not and could not admit. No bombsight could compensate for all the meteorological conditions a bomb had to descend through. Conversely, a flak shell had the same problems, although the gunners knew their meteorological conditions. That meant that bombing and defense against it became more scattered, obviating some of the praised technical advances. Over German territory in Wo World War I, fighters and antiair- craft guns brought down about equal numbers of Allied planes, thirty-six by flak and thirty-five by fighters.13 Of the thousands of Allied planes destroyed over Germany in World War II, no statistics could be found listing losses through fight- ers or flak.

Noteworthy raids of the time were the destruction of the Eder and Möhne dams on 16-17 May. A bouncing bomb had been developed to skip over the water until it hit the dam, where it sank and exploded at a set depth. It was a raid of immense bravery by the crews involved. Of the nineteen planes dispatched, eight did not return, putting the raid into the same class as the MAN-Augsburg raid months earlier. Over 1,200 people, again including many foreign work- ers, drowned in the flood waves rushing down the valleys. But the main damage was consequential because German hydro dams from that time onward were only kept half full, reducing the generation of badly needed power. Another raid had very tragic consequences. On 15-16 July the Pathfinders missed the Peugeot motor factory at Montbeliard, France, by seven hundred yards causing the bombers to hit the workers' houses instead of the factory; 123 Frenchmen who undoubtedly thought the war was over for them were killed and 336 wounded by their former allies. 154 In a similar raid on the Renault factory at Billancourt in March 1942 the French losses were 367 killed and 341 badly injured.155 Including the missions into occupied Western Europe, over 24,000 Bomber Command sorties were flown between early March and end of July 1943 from which over one thousand air- 223 craft did not return.156 Most of these losses occurred over the Ruhr which caused Harris to call off the attack on the German industrial heartland. The Ruhr continued to function until the end of the war, albeit under tenuous conditions. The next major operation of Bomber Command was the battle of Hamburg from 24 July to 3 August 1943. It was a full success from Harris's point of view. The battle was fought together with the Eighth USAAF which blasted the city dur- ing daytime.

The raid proved that, without a prior bom- bardment of the shore defense and cutting of lines for rein- forcements, a landing was at best doubtful. After landings in Italy an investigation was launched to evaluate their success. To nobody's surprise it was found that Professor Zuckerman's plan to smash the Italian railway sys- tem was the main factor.184 A similar plan of destruction of coastal defense and railway centers in France and Belgium was submitted to General Eisenhower, by that time the supreme commander of allied forces in Europe and his deputy, Air Marshal Tedder. Both endorsed it wholeheartedly based on the Italian experience. The instruments to carry out these attacks were to be the U.S. and British strategic bombers. But there a long drawn out fight started. The bomber leaders, Harris more than Spaatz, objected violently and listed numerous argu- ments. The list included the fact that their forces were not trained for precision bombing, that Bomber Command had no experience in the necessary daylight operations, that there would be countless deaths among French and Belgian civil- ians, and so on. These circles were supported by the Air Ministry, the prime minister and the British Cabinet, including scientists such as Lord Cherwell. The argument was won by Eisenhower/Tedder and in April 1944 Bomber Command under Harris and the Eighth USAAF under Doolittle were placed under Tedder who issued orders as to which targets were to be destroyed. What followed until 6 June, the date of the Normandy landings, was a suc- cessful destruction of the Belgian and French railway systems.

The campaign brought heavy losses to both sides and was finally won by RAF Bomber Command. It was the time of the famous Churchill pronouncement that so much was owed by so many to so few.

But the RAF was fighting on its home ground, whereas the German fighters could only spend short periods over southern England to shield the bombers, before being forced to return because of limited fuel capacities. It was a tough battle but facts prove that Churchill's statement was one of many wartime propaganda pronouncements. The Germans learned in short order what Bomber Command had experienced the year before. Bomber forma- tions flying in daylight take dreadful losses.

After his retirement as chief of air staff, committees evaluated technical and scientific developments and thanks to men like Tizard, and also to a degree Cherwell, fighter squadrons were created and radar stations built.

It was this combi- nation which doomed the Luftwaffe attack on the RAF instal- lations. Military defense had been streamlined.

As mentioned earlier, Würzburg was not defended. The Luftwaffe nightfighter controllers announced at 21:20, at a time when the Pathfinders had already marked Würzburg, that the bomber stream heading for the city was a "feint attack."19 They correctly guessed that Nürnberg was to be raided and sent some of the fighters there. Others were dispatched to Frankfurt to deal with the Mosquitos that were making a diversionary raid on nearby Hanau.

When it was realized that daylight bombing was too risky and costly, the RAF in October 1939, the Luftwaffe in August 1940, and the USAAF only later in the Pacific War in 1945 had to switch to night raids. Both Britain and Germany created in short order nightfighter squadrons, which consisted of heavier aircraft, mostly twin-engine types. With the help of ground- based radar stations and control centers, they were directed towards the bombers; onboard radar devices brought them closer, but the final engagement was visual. There are numer- ous accounts by bomber and nightfighter crews describing the viciousness of these fights. As the war progressed, sophistication of electronic devices to detect, approach, and destroy an enemy aircraft became leg- endary. Gone were the days when Britain considered, at the recommendation of Lord Cherwell, hanging steel nets seeded with aerial mines from barrage balloons hoping that, like a fly going into a cobweb, the enemy aircraft would run into these defenses.8 The methods of deceiving the enemy's electronic defenses also reached proportions which were at times bril- liantly scientific, at times just plain smart. The Hamburg raids in July 1943 were successful because the German radar stations had been put out of action by aluminum strips scientifically dimensioned to interfere with the wavelength of the German radar sets. Tons of these strips, called Window, were released from the bombers and floated to earth.

The machine tool capacity of the factory had been used after every raid on the ball-bearing factories at Schweinfurt, about forty kilometers from Würzburg, to repair the damaged and salvaged ball-bearing production machinery. There may have been production of strategic value, but as the factory was completely destroyed by the USAAF and artillery fire on 31 March 1945, no records survived.2 21 Further smaller industries in and around Würzburg at the time included the chocolate factory Franconia, a plywood and exotic wood sawmill, two breweries, and a small ball-bearing plant relocated from Schweinfurt after the raids on that city. But certainly of military-strategic importance were the bar- racks of the 55th Infantry Regiment, the artillery barracks adja- cent to it, the barracks housing a communication unit of the army close to the Noell plant and the Hindenburg Kaserne (barracks) near the Koenig und Bauer plant. The Wehrmacht had several big warehouses adjacent to the railway yard. They were crammed with food supplies when the war ended. Then there was the Fliegerhorst (airfield) of the Luftwaffe on the hill east of the city. It had been a clandestine military training school during the Weimar Republic. When Hitler started to build up the Luftwaffe from 1933 it was fenced off and a secre- tive building activity began.

From single-engine scout planes the nations developed single-engine fighters, with engines of undreamed of power, to four-engine bombe mbers by 1917 and 1918. The time from blue- print to flying design was still short. It took no more than three months to have a new type of plane in action at the front. The number of factories went up exponentially, and great sums of money and man-hours were spent. In Germany alone, the increase of factories went from two to eight by 1914, with another five major ones in operation by 1918. The cost also sky- rocketed. A simple Rumpler Taube, made by the Flugmaschine Wright GmbH in 1914, cost 25,000 marks (approximately £1,250), in itself a sizable sum at the time. A six-engine bomber cost 750,000 marks in 1917.

It allowed his bombers to return with ease. Hitler wanted the German people to see the wrecks of the bombers; a real folly when one considers that many came down in isolated and sparsely populated areas. On the other hand, a mistake Harris made was not to gain air supremacy at night over Germany. Both Douhet and Trenchard in their doctrines state that air supremacy is a mile- stone in a bomber war. Harris, of course, was too much in a hurry to knock Germany out of the war. He took the risk, at considerable cost to his men and planes.11 Italy had few nightfighters and few antiaircraft guns.

There are accounts of Germans and foreign workers who describe how some fighters first came down so low as to prac- tically look into the windows, getting up in the air again and 249 then blasting the train. Worse still are accounts where the train had stopped and the passengers fleeing into the fields were raked by the guns. The RAF made a science out of attacking rail and motor transport. From a report for the period of December 1944 to March 1945, it is apparent that attacks lasted only two and a half to three seconds, during which the fighter blasted the tar- get over a flight path of 600 to 700 yards.225 No doubt

A total of sixteen missions were flown to Berlin ranging in dispatched aircraft from twenty-two Lancasters providing a spoof raid for the assault on nearby Magdeburg on 21-22 January 1944 to the 811 mentioned above. Most raids involved 500 to 700 bombers. Despite the difficul-  232 To DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN WORLD WAR II 233 ties, there was damage in the city. Government buildings industrial plants, the railway system, and the Kaiser Wilhelm Gedächtniskirche on Kurfürstendam, still visible today as a monument against area bombing, were damaged or destroyed During the battle 8,120 bombers dropped about 30,000 tons of high explosives and incendiaries and killed about 10,000 peo- ple against a loss of 493 aircraft. 178 Harris, who was very outspoken against panacea targets such as oil, ball-bearings, molybdenum, etc., because of the dif- ficulties in finding them and the losses incurred, blissfully con- vinced Churchill and Portal in letters in November and December 1943, before and during the raids, that wrecking Berlin from end to end would cost Bomber Command 400 to 500 planes, but would cost Germany the war. Surrender would be inevitable by 1 April 1944.179 The battle of Berlin must be considered one of his panacea targets like the Ruhr and others. He was right, panacea target bombing did not make the Germans throw in the towel. Harris's superiors all the way up to Churchill let him continue the area campaign, seemingly convinced that the strategy would eventually work. While the battle of Berlin raged, many other cities were vis- ited, partly to divert the German defenses and partly because the Air Ministry wanted them attacked to avoid a general recovery of German industry. Harris even laid on a raid on the ball-bearing town of Schweinfurt with 734 sorties on 24-25 February 1944. The Eighth had pummeled the town the day befor

Suddenly there was this aircraft noise, explosions not too far away, and machine-gun and cannon fire coming towards us. We dived through the small windows back into the basement and survived. Even the horse and cart miraculously survived. Two days later, on 20 March fighter bombers returned and raked the suburb of Heidingsfeld. Because it had been incor- porated into the city of Würzburg and supposedly as such showed on the Bomber Command target list, it had been 80 percent destroyed during the 16 March raid. Now four days later twenty more bombs fell, killing eleven people. The northwestern part of Würzburg, called the Zellerau, where most of the army barracks were located, had escaped the main raid fairly unharmed. On 22 March that situation changed. Eight USAAF B-24 bombers of the 2nd Air Division released their bombs, about eighty, high above our cottage. They devastated the Zellerau including the barracks. We saw and heard the bombs coming down-a frightening experience. The official record indicates that 19.2 tons of bombs were dropped and that the target was a secondary one.21 Strangely, despite the damage only four people were killed. The primary assigned target had been the Giebelstadt Luftwaffe base, south of Würzburg. But when 445 Bombardment Group was to release its bombs another group intersected its course at a lower level and the Giebelstadt target was scrubbed.22 The next day, 23 March, fighter bombers came over the city and strafed what seemed worth attacking, but effected little damage. 47 There followed a lull of three days in which we only saw the planes and their contrails over us without being attacked. But then on 26 March it was our turn again. Eleven B-17s of 1st Air Division of the Eighth USAAF tried to bomb the still intact gas works and the repaired railway station. They dropped 110 bombs of 500 lbs. each, all of which missed and fell on Unterdürrbach, a purely residential village north of Würzburg. The bombers, although,

Caen was a mistake. It was a tactical raid gone wrong. Yet no media reported on the consequences and details of the raid on 7 July 1944 and subsequent raids on nearby vil- lages. Caen itself received 2,650 tons of bombs188 and lost 2,000, and perhaps as many as 15,000, citizens.189 The city was 60 per- cent destroyed and the rubble posed problems for the advanc- ing Allied troops. British wartime propaganda handled it under the motto: "Do like Dad, keep Mum."190 In 1962. Würzburg and Caen became partner cities based on the expe- riences and devastating senseless destruction they both had suffered from American and British bombers. Caen, like Monte Cassino and Wesel, are typical examples of the bombers having gone amuck by being plowed over several times. There were no Wehrmacht units in these places, there could not be because they were piles of rubble after the first raids. As an example, Wesel was raided eleven times by the USAAF and ten times by the RAF. 191 237 About half the effort against targets in France, Belgium, and Holland was to support the advancing Allied ground troops. The other half were missions flown against a new German threat to the United Kingdom. The Allies knew that at Peenemünde flying bombs and rockets were being developed. The successful precision raid of 17-18 August 1943 had delayed their development, but not stopped it. After the raid, research and production was moved to places in Austria, and caves and salt mines in Thuringia. The V-1 flying pilotless bomb was ready for action and let loose on 12 June 1944, six days after the Normandy landings. Intelligence and aerial reconnaissance had identified the launching sites being built earlier. About one hundred of them had been constructed with the help of 40,000 French and other foreign workers. But doubts about the existence and danger of the V-1 h

Bomber fleets raiding Britain were small, with the biggest raid carried out by twenty-eight Gothas on the night of 19-20 May 1918. Between 1916 and the end of the war, the KAGOHL, the squadron that was under direct con- trol of the Army Supreme Command, carried out twenty- seven raids on the British Isles. As daylight bombing became expensive in losses, nineteen of these raids were flown under the cover of darkness. The most effective ones with regard to civilian lives snuffed out and damage inflicted were the ones on Folkstone on 25 May 1917, in which ninety-five persons were killed, and on London on 13 June 1917 with 162 people killed. The latter raid, in typical fashion, was meant to destroy docks, wharves, and warehouses in East London, but there was also a hit on an East End Council School. "Incidental" losses were 120 innocent school children killed or wounded.47 The German communique stated that the raid was a success in destroying the intended targets. British opin- ion was undoubtedly that the "Huns" had visited them again. Public opinion was described as hysterical for both protection and revenge. 48 The Gothas and the Riesenflugzeug also raided French cities, and were frequently used to bomb tactical targets near the front line. Paris had suffered only isolated small air raids for two years after the Zeppelin raids over France had been discontinued because of heavy losses in 1916. However, in order to underline the impact of the German land offensive of 21 March 1918, Paris was attacked in that month by a greater force. The civilian toll was 250 people. The material and moral damage of one such raid was probably negligible. What brought home to the Parisians that they were unpro- tected was another German weapon. The front was about 120  114 To DESTROY A CITY BOMBING IN WORLD WAR I 115 kilometers (72 miles) away from Paris. The city could not be considered to be located near the fighting.
