To a great extent it was everywhere being subordinated to feelings of hatred and revenge born of the war, or smothered by the will to survive the conflict. Thus the overwhelming view among British members of parliament was that one should applaud rather than criticize a government that was doing everything to bring the war to a speedy conclusion.306 So long as the Germans continued to stand behind Hitler and his generals, as seemed to be the case, then they must bear the responsibility for this war. Much as one might feel sympathy for rats that had to be killed, when one was aware that they could infect children with disease and bring destruction on British society then this sympathy must cease. So the more Germany was 'softened' for the invasion, the more the fighting forces and the nation would be grateful.307 What one was doing was only to destroy the enemy's centres of production and lines of communication and supply, so such military necessities should not be placed on a moral level. The classic distinction between combatants and non- combatants was in any case a thing of the past, terrible though this might be. The sole moral principle must now be to end the war as quickly as possible. That was the most humane course.308 In a war, when dropping bombs, one could not be so foolish as to worry about civilians.

The former, an earlier British colonial officer who had seen how the British gave advance warning to unruly natives before bombing their villages, was a man steeped in European culture who was trying to spare the civilian population. The latter believed terror bombing would shorten the war, and save both Allied and enemy lives; the US Army Air Forces, he said. were not in Europe 'just to play cricket'. Gen. Cabell, and finally Spaatz and Eisenhower too, in July turned down the plan for psychological or terror bombing; one factor for the air force officers was the desire to keep the US Army Air Force's image clean in the eyes of the public as it strove for inde- pendence. The 'precision' bombing of the past was to continue (though this intention had, of course, already been undermined by the blind bombing using H2X during the previous winter). After the invasion, and the German bombardment with V-weapons, the terror plan was to be reactivated.449 449 Schaffer, Wings of Judgment, 70-9. 153 EXCURSUS: THE BEGINNINGS OF A SOVIET STRATEGIC BOMBING WAR AGAINST GERMANY The Soviet Union, too, tried to wage a strategic bombing war against Germany.

The Soviets, too, bombed cities; Stalin repeatedly asked Churchill to pass on his thanks to Bomber Command's aircrews for the destruction of German cities, and showed great interest in aerial reconnaissance photographs of devastated German residential areas.452 There were, essentially, two very practical obstacles standing in the way of the Red Army carrying on a st

The anti-Hitler coalition also had a moral dimension: it insisted on the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan. Already, in its capitals, the post-war order was not being thought about only on a European scale. In Moscow in October 1943 its foreign ministers had agreed not only to work for the final defeat of the aggressor nations and to bring war criminals to justice, but also to set up international organizations that in future would guarantee the sovereignty of states. Roosevelt wanted his own country to be a member of the planned United Nations bodies: this would perpetuate the United States' active role in world politics, and avoid a fresh withdrawal into the isolationism that had followed the First World War. Roosevelt was also keen on involving the Soviet Union, as by now the second great world power ahead of Britain, in decisions of international importance.

Henri-Honore Giraud and Gen. Charles de Gaulle, the arming of French divisions with Allied help, and their successful deployment, especially in Italy, boosted French assertiveness. This trend was reinforced at the end of 1943 when Giraud, mainly concerned with military matters, was sidelined in favour of De Gaulle, who was pursuing a political agenda first and foremost.62 The efforts of De Gaulle and the CFLN were directed at restoring France to its former greatness. In their view, this could best be achieved by an independent French contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany. The formation of a provisional national assembly (Assembl√©e Consultative Provisoire) in Algiers in November 1943, and the proclamation of a provisional French government a few days before the invasion, were also intended as early markers of France's claim to sovereignty. 63 For a long time the Allied leaders reacted ambivalently to calls for recognition from the Free French. Roosevelt rejected such advances or played for time, doubting that De Gaulle's claims would be legitimized through the ballot box. With regard to the establishment of political organs, he tried to leave everything open until France could hold free elections. Roosevelt long refused to acknowledge that De Gaulle and his movement were winning more and more Frenchmen to their side, both in France and abroad. 64 Churchill vacillated. While he did not want to forfeit the sympathy of his most important ally by supporting De Gaulle's ambitions, he took more account than Roosevelt of the pragmatic requirements of the war in this respect.

What mattered were, as already at Casablanca, prag- matic considerations, questions of assumed effectiveness, the operational possibilities, and the strategic objectives. This was generally also true of the Americans; with them, however, there was also the need to consider the ethical image of their bomber forces in the eyes of their own people; this could be safeguarded better with selective targeting than with area bombing. The latter was therefore happily left to the British,24 since both methods were after all intended to lead to the same end.

A war of attrition duration against the United States and European colonial powers, followed by a compromise peace, was to provide the basis for Japanese supremacy in the Asian world. Like their political partners in Germany, the Japanese too in 1942 could not escape the realization that they had failed. Quite apart from the inability of the Japanese army and navy leaderships to agree on an overall strategy, the military might of their island empire was already insufficient to defend the front lines they had captured. Since 1942 began the Japanese too had been on the defensive, having to yield ground and using up their armed forces in decisive battles of their own seeking that more and more began to look like acts of despair. In this situation the calls for mutuo on aid between Tokyo and Berlin grew. Japan urged Germany to make a separat peace with the Soviet Union so as to be able to concentrate all her forces the fight against the Atlantic powers, and thus improve matters for her Asian partner. The German leadership asked just as vainly for a Japanese attack on the Soviet Union. The gap between the interests of the two powers was too wide As the Japanese forces were forced back further and further towards the homeland, the camp of those in Tokyo opposed to the government greu stronger.

When it came to putting all this into practice, however, there were frequent clashes. Unlike the British government, the American administration at that time had little inclination for serious involve- ment in the liberated areas of western Europe. But this did not prevent Roosevelt entertaining specific ideas about how those countries should be administered. As was already the case in Italy, he wanted supreme executive power in France to be vested in an Allied Military Government of Occupied Territory (AMGOT), with the CFLN in an exclusively consultative role. The French were furious. The British, the US State Department, and even Eisen- hower reacted more flexibly, and Roosevelt became increasingly isolated. In spring 1944 the US president yielded on many counts. He gave Allied com- manders-in-chief permission to settle all military and civil matters jointly with the CFLN, provided this did not involve any recognition of the Committee under international law. Churchill too, who often acted as a buffer between the two sides, expressed agreement with this arrangement.70 commanded by Gen.

They were, however, more circumspect when dealing with commandos-units of indigenous and Allied soldiers that carried out sabotage or reconnaissance missions in the occupied countries, n of key transport installations and beach reconnaissance such as the destruction of on the north coast of France in preparation for the invasion. In October 1942 Hitler issued a 'commando order', via the OKW, stipulating that members of commando units, even if unarmed or wearing uniforms, must be 'liquidated down to the last man'. 148 A good many senior officers were even more specific, as, for example, the Wehrmacht commander in Norway: 'If one man is spared for interrogation, he must not survive his comrades by more than 24 hours.'149 145 See Deutschland im zweiten Weltkrieg, v. 442-3; Paxton, Vichy France, 297-8; ADAP, E, vii. doc. 230, 435 ff.

The Germans had been able to prepare f the disbanding of the Italian Fourth Army in good time, as it had been on the cards since Mussolini's overthrow in July 1943. The newly formed Nineteenel Army High Command (AOK 19) was therefore able to make rapid progress in disarming the four Italian infantry divisions and both coastal divisions east the Rh√¥ne. By 9 September the majority of the approximately 41,000 Italie soldiers had been disarmed.68 There was, in any case, no chance of resistan since the Germans had already cut off all the Italian Fourth Army's lineso ance. communication between the alpine passes in the east and the Rh√¥ne in the west. Rundstedt ordered that any opposition should be put down ruthlesslo since the behaviour of the Italians was considered rank treachery. In late August 1943 the OKW had still been considering keeping an Italian army corps of two divisions on the Mediterranean coast. It soon became clear however, that although many of the disarmed Italian troops declared them selves ready to work for the Germans, very few wanted to fight as soldiers on the side of their former Axis partner. As a result, no Italian units were formed The few Italians who were willing to fight were simply incorporated int Reich leader SS (Himmler) SS Main Operations Office (J√ºttner) Mil.
