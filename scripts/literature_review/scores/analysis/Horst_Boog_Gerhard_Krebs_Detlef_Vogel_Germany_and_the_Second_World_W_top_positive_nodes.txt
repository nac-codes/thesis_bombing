But it was not until the end of February 1944 that the Americans returned, with the British, thus allowing him to move the ball-bearings industry elsewhere in the meantime. Under the direction of managing director Philipp Kessler, whom Speer appointed general commissioner for roller-bearings, the measures started immediately after the first raid to ensure the armaments industry's supply of ball-bearings of all types were stepped up. The Swedish ball-bearings industry gave active support. Simpler friction bearings, often made from ceramics, largely replaced the expensive ball-bearings, and made up for shortfalls that were in fact not all that great once it was found that German industry had stockpiled enough bearings for six to twelve months. Moreover, aircraft production was in any case being switched from bombers, which needed around 1,000 ball- bearings, to fighters which used only 150 each.

At that time Galland pressed the view that it would be better, given the great distances that the small numbers of single-engined fighters being put up against the Americans' daylight bombers had to cover when they were located at the periphery, for them to be stationed centrally. It would be better to deliver a hefty punch from the inside at Geschwader strength than deal a few ineffectual taps with Gruppen from the outside. This would, however, mean accepting that the Americans were going to fly in broad daylight, clearly visible to the population, deep into Germany before they were engaged, or that the fighters would then be quite unable to give cover to the areas at the edge. Göring, for political, propaganda, and psychological reasons, did not, however, want the American bombers flying by day in full view of the German public, and turned down the idea of the fighters being stationed at the centre; he believed the American daylight raids could be got the better of by over- coming the lack of training of the fighter pilots. At the same time, he accused them of 'miserable failure', even though during the raid by B-17s (with a fighter escort) on Bremen just before, on 17 April, they had shot down 16 bombers in spite of considerable difficulties caused by their scattered deployment at bases along the periphery. The reasons for the overall unsatisfactory performance of the day fighters lay basically in their low numbers and material shortcomings rather than, at this stage, in any lack of will or ability in the pilots. Galland was aware of this when, called upon by Hitler to account for the increasing daylight incursions, he worked out for him that to achieve the necessary concentration of fighters over the Reich he needed three to four times as many fighters as there were 27 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', MGFA, BA-MA ZA 1/2476, 439 ff. 28 Army Air Forces, ii. 843-4.

The air defence of the homeland was now looked after only by the four fighter Gruppen that had stayed behind, and by a few smaller training units and factory squadrons-in all, around 180 single-engined and 150 twin- engined fighters, some of them with inexperienced crews; while the units that had flown to France had been so scattered, and had suffered such losses during the move, that they too no longer represented the fighting force they had been back in Germany. So as not to be detected by the enemy radar and attacked by Allied fighters they had flown low, often lost their way, and failed to find their landing places. In the search for their airfields many ran out of fuel, so that the pilots had to take to their parachutes. Others crashed on landing on a bomb-damaged runway, while some were shot down by their own anti- aircraft defences. 630 Out of 57 fighters who left Wiesbaden for Evreux, only 628 Gundelach, 'Drohende Gefahr West', 317-18; Galland, The First and the Last, 284-302; Priller, J.G. 26, 224-6; Davis, Spaatz, App. 9, puts the USAAF strength in Europe in July 1944 at 10,343

The German early-warning system had recognized the impending raid in good time; 43 of the bombers (7.6 per cent) did not return to base. Because of poor visibility and markers badly placed with H2S, a number of raids such as those on Munich on 6 September, Hanover on 27 September and 18 October, and Leipzig on 20 October were just as much of a failure as that on Kassel on 3 October mentioned earlier. During the three attacks on Berlin on the nights of 23 and 31 August and 3 September, only 27 out of a total of 1,719 bombers hit inside the 5-km zone around the aiming-point. The bomb-carpet crept back up to 50 km in the approach direction. A city as large as this with no clear features produced a very unclear echo on the navigators' radar screens. Of the bombers dispatched to Berlin, 7.2 per cent did not return, and 6.8 per 164 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, ii. 203 and iv. 23, n. 3; Middlebrook and Everitt, Bomber Command War Diaries, 440.  54 I.I.

The bomber force was short of 364 crews. Only the Zerstörer force had a surplus, of 23 crews; but these were also needed for giving ground support to the army. With the single-engined fighters there were only 1,187 fully operational pilots for an actual strength of 1,535 machines-meaning that some 350 fighters had to be flown by pilots with only limited operational training (assuming they all had even that). Among the fighter aircraft, however, only 66 per cent were fully serviceable. 20 The general of fighters strikingly compared the Reich's air defence situation to 'a house without a roof.21 Milch stressed that any war would be bound to be lost if there was not air superiority in the places where it was needed.22 President Roosevelt had already commented that there was no such superi- ority, in his message to Congress on 17 September 1943 in which he spoke of Hitler's having a 'fortress without a roof, which meant that it was not impregnable. In fact there had never been a roof, because after the initial blitzkrieg wars Germany had been cradled in soothing security and had never got round to building one. When those in charge recognized-too late-the need for it, the overall war situation was, as Galland writes, making it neces- sary to 'use up' the available fighter forces on the land fronts in the east and south. So long as this roof was not restored and strengthened to cope with the increased demands, 1943 was for Milch 'a year to sit tight and clench our teeth. The situation will change a lot in 1944, and these basic changes must already begin to appear in the autumn [of 1943].'23 16 Reich minister for aviat

Still at that date the far more costly training of 'offensive' pilots (i.e. for bombers, ground-support aircraft, and so on) predominated.101 Galland himself had to admit that he had been too late in recognizing this problem over unit commanders in the fighter arm.102 97 Grabmann, 'Luftverteidigung', ZA 1/2476, 566-72. 98 BA-MA Nachlaß Galland, BA-MA N 211/1, 31-2; Toliver and Constable, Galland, 234. 99 Boog, 'Offizierkorps der Luftwaffe', 290-1; id., Luftwaffenführung, 335, 455; Galland, The First and the Last, 228; Generalleutnant a.D.

It was now plain that without full fighter cover it was no longer possible to penetrate deep into Germany. The effects of the American 1943 bombe offensive remained modest and debatable, and the 8th Air Force had for the moment lost its superiority in the air over Germany by day. It had, however been able to delay German achievement of their aircraft production plans, and in particular to cut the number of fighters being brought into service.245 4. THE POINTBLANK CRISIS: ALLIED CONCERNS, AND MEASURES TO DEAL WITH THEM, FOLLOWING THE SCHWEINFURT DISASTER The intensive Allied bombing campaign had by now been going on for mor than half a year, but in British Bomber Command one of the operation's mais aims-neutralizing the German fighter defences so as to provide superiority is the air during the planned invasion, which had been stated as an 'intermedias. objective'-had faded entirely into the background. And for the Americans the certainty that Gen. Eaker had still been voicing in July 1943 that there we absolutely no doubt' that 'we can reduce the German Air Force to impotence this year'246 was, after Schweinfurt, a thing of the past. As could have bee predicted, the 'joint' bomber offensive had proved to be no such thing; the British and American bombing raids were not complementing each other. The setback suffered at Schweinfurt, and the discovery by the British intelligence services that the strength of the German day- and night-fighter force had between January and September 1943, risen from 300 to 700 and from 370 + 590 respectively, and was-albeit at the expense of the land fronts- growing, put this problem back at the very centre of the Allied air forces' stil concerns. There were two questions to be settled. On the one hand it had to be decided whether the American tactics of daylight bombing by bomber for mations undertaking their own defence (i.e. without fighter cover) were not fact wrong. And on the other, one needed to look at whether the British Bomber

This division of labour between day- and night-fighter operations had proved not to be cost-effective, successful though 'Wild Boar' had been during the summer and autumn of 1943 (up to March 1944 its pilots had brought down around 330 enemy aircraft). It was hoped, by bringing the single- and twin-engined night fighters together in the fighter divisions with their much better view of the situation in the air, to make night fighting focused on the list of bombers' targets more effective. The staff of Fighter Sector Control Centre, set up on 8 March, was linked to eight night-fighter stations between Frankfurt am Main and Karlsruhe, and to two 'Y' ground control sites. Allocating this area to 3 Fighter Division at Deelen simplified air situation assessment and night-fighter control there as it did with the day-fighter opera- tion, the more so as RAF Bomber Command was now frequently approaching from France, crossing into German territory over the Upper Rhine.569 From the end of September 1943 the number of night fighters defending Reich airspace dropped by around 25 per cent to 242 twin-engined and 50 single-engined machines on 13 February 1944. This was due not to the with- drawal of units to be sent to other fronts, but to the lack of fresh supplies of aircraft due to installing the new LICHTENSTEIN SN2 AI radars in the supply depots that equipped new machines for squadron service.570 Night Fighter 566 See also Ch.
