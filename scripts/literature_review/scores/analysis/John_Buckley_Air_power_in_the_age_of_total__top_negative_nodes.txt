The demands made on Soviet investment at a time when reconstruction was urgently required fused with espionage to produce a plutonium atomic device by 1949, although it appears that the USSR would have had a bomb by 1951/52 withoutoutside input anyway. Stalin was conscious that a world where the USA had atomic weapons, and the USSR did not, would be unacceptable and a clear symbol of the superiority of thecapitalist West over the communist East. Before the USSR had acquired atomic weapons, Stalin’s policy was one of bluff, in which he pursued a belligerent foreign policy that belied his concern over the American atomic monopoly. By conducting the policieshe did, for example over the Berlin crisis, Stalin attempted to convince the West that atomic weapons mattered little in foreign policy. Despite the heavy burden, Stalin determined to pursue the policy, even when others counselled a more conciliatoryapproach to East–West relations. The long term cost was the acceptance of a ruinous arms race with the USA, first to attain atomic capability, then thermonuclear weapons, followed by ballistic missiles, and ultimately the capacity for mutually assured destruction.Although Stalin died in 1953, he had already set in motion a policy that successive Soviet leaders could do little about. With the Cold War already deep and hostility and rivalry endemic, the moment to avert the arms race and the age of nuclear plenty hadpassed long before the middle of the 1950s. It must also be stated that the cost of conciliation with the USA in the late 1940s was one that few Soviets, and certainly not Stalin, would have been willing to accept. 30 By the middle of the 1950s, the course and nature of the development of strategic air power in the era of the Cold War was set and, although manned bombers were to be replaced by intercontinental ballistic

Was indiscriminate starvation any better than indiscriminate bombardment? Deep ethical and moral issues emerged from the growth in capability and theory concerning aerial bombardment and industrial war. Attacks on military centres, even if this resulted in “collateral civilian casualties”, were acceptable, but crossing the Rubiconcame when the notion of targeting civilians themselves was developed. During the First World War, bombing strategy, although primarily aimed at military areas, also accepted that inaccurate bombs would hit and kill civilians and this was acceptable because itwould damage enemy morale. Deliberate targeting of civilians declined as a strategy in the 1930s but re-emerged during the Second World War in the RAF once it proved impossible to bomb anything accurately. Although the Allied governments neveradmitted it openly, from early 1942 onwards first the Royal Air Force and then latterly the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) pursued a policy of area bombing. In effect this was a policy of deliberately destroying urban centres and their populationsin an effort to cause disruption and chaos in the enemy state and thus undermine their war effort. This proved to be a less effective way of damaging the enemy state than precision bombing (as undertaken by the USAAF over Europe) but until 1944 itwas the only method with which the RAF , flying at night to keep their losses under control, could achieve anything. The rationale in military terms made sense if it could be proven to be effective. Despite continuing claims to the contrary, strategic bombing in World War II – area bombing included – did make a major contribution to t

The evidence of the new totality of war, precipitated by air attack, was there for all to see. Gas masks, air raid shelters, evacuation of children from cities, air raid wardens, blackout procedures, anti-aircraft gun batteries, barrage balloons,searchlights, air raid sirens, bomb damage, clear-up duties and many other measures were forced upon society by air attacks, or even the threat of such assaults. There was even an Air Raid Protection Institute set up in London with an attendant journal todisseminate all the latest thinking on equipment, gadgets and civil defence. The impact of air power on society during and even before the advent of the war was considerable and far reaching. However, far from causing the collapse of society as many argued it would, air attack actually forced the many strata and groups within even the most divided of communities to pull together in the interests of mutual survival. Indeed, air bombardmenthelped to consolidate opinions against enemies during war. Far from wanting to surrender or overthrow governments civilian populations demanded that their armed forces “give as good as they got”. T o a degree, resentment caused by bombing wasfocused on the enemy rather than on home governments. Indeed, some historians even go as far as to state that bombing of cities was counterproductive in that it hardened the resolve of populations and persuaded them to go on fighting. 16 It is clear that, far from fracturing societies and causing revolutions, air bombardment often pushed the bulk of the population together, at least superficially.

Against little or no opposition, the Americans razed city after city to the ground killing hundreds of thousands of Japanese and concluded with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Without doubt, the ability of air power to inflict a punishing degree of industrial and machine war was proven in the months of the so-called “torching” of Japan and the apogee of total war had been reached. Such was the destruction and indeed the revulsion in many quarters that although the bombing offensive ended the war against Japan without the need for an amphibious invasion, the cost in ethical and moral terms had been heavy and quite possibly excessive. Curiously, the USA had been particularly critical of indiscriminate bombing in the years leading up to World War II and in Europe had attempted, certainly until the closing stages of the war against Germany, to pursue a policy of precision bombing of industrial and military targets. Not for them was the indiscriminate area bombing adopted by the RAF’s Bomber Command, or so they claimed.52 In fact, the desire to end the war quickly in the winter of 1944–5 when weather and operating conditions precluded precision raids, led the US 8th Air Force to move towards more area bombing (although they euphemistically called it bombing of “marshalling yards”). The new tactics improved efficiency and clearly contributed to the collapse of the German state in 1945, but it was at the cost of lingering qualms about surrendering the moral and ethical high ground that the US had tried to stake out for itself.53 In the Far East,  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 203 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 192with racism and barbarity on both sides, there were far fewer concerns about killing Japanese civilians in the first place, but with the USAAF following an incrementalpath towards “total war” the final

The limitations of post-war air power Although some viewed air power as the ultimate weapon in the post-war period itwas to transpire that air power had serious shortcomings and was not to dominate the military landscape of the world in the manner envisaged and which seemed to have been indicated in the closing stages of World War II. 5 Strategic and nuclear equipped air forces were not to play a major role in determining superpower policy until the mid-to-late 1950s, and only then did they exert the kind of restraining deterrent effect that emerged with the adoption of MAD. However, even when nuclear bombersand missiles were available in significant quantities they did not provide the level of deterrence expected. The USA and the USSR continued to be embroiled in indirect confrontation and, moreover, it was to become apparent that in anything other thandirect confrontation, nuclear attack was neither credible nor real

The US policy of massive retaliation was completely undermined by therise of Soviet strategic nuclear capability, and the consequent emergence of MAD was in essence a method of management, a tacit acceptance that nuclear weapons were no longer merely another weapon in the diplomatic war of international relations. Therewere concerns over the development of first strike capabilities and viable counter- measures were all viewed as potentially destabilizing effects, thus illustrating a crucial difference between the nuclear age and the age of conventional bomber deterrenceof the 1930s when such deterrence was far less credible. 34 Nevertheless, the finely balanced nuclear deterrence held, largely because the consequences of failure were unthinkable. The search for first strike capability (the strategy of wiping out theenemy’s nuclear strength in one surprise first attack) continually foundered because of technical failings and because of the basic underlying assumption that the risks of creating such a capability were too great. It was a tenet of nuclear strategy not to makeopponents believe that they were vulnerable to a first strike because it might prompt them into rash preventative action of their own. The power and fear of nuclear weapons was such that direct and hostile confrontation between two similarly equipped powerswas something to be avoided, and in this respect air power had reached its zenith in making mass war both unfeasible and unthinkable. Y et for all that supposed power, in reality strategic nuclear weapons played a largely peripheral role in the conduct and development of Cold War strategies. Little of advantage was ever gained out of the possession of nuclear weapons, other than theavoidance of suffering the disadvantage of not possessing them. Eve

In thepost-war years nuclear weapons became political and diplomatic tools and many have viewed the atomic bombs, retrospectively, in the same way. The revisionist school of historians, principally spearheaded by Gar Alperovitz, has argued that the bombs weredropped for political reasons, primarily to intimidate the Soviets, and as such can be viewed as the first major act of the Cold War. The argument rests on the point that the political aspects of the decision to drop the bomb predominated over militaryconsiderations. It is claimed that Japan was about to surrender anyway, that the bombs were unnecessary to end the war and indeed that the US government prolonged the war in order to use the weapon to wring concessions out of Stalin. 59 While these arguments probably attest a level of significance to the atomic bombs that was not so obvious at the time, it is clear that some in power did consider the bombs to be a new extreme in war and as such they could be used for broader  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 207 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 196political aims. However, this does not support the argument that such considerations predominated. The most significant argument revolves around whether or not Japan was about to surrender and, although there is evidence that the Japanese government was looking to end the war, it was on nothing approaching terms acceptable to the USA.60 The fact that the Japanese were still vacillating after Nagasaki suggests that prior to the events of 6–9 August there was little likelihood of a realistic surrender being negotiated. Consequently the USA was liable to use all reasonable methods to end the war. The atomic bombings can therefore be viewed as another measure, following on from the fire bombings, towards forcing the Japanese surrender and as such in the context of the time can be viewed as “necessary”, especially with the spectre of thousands of US casualties looming if Operation Olympic  had to be carried thro

Initially, air power interest divided between pursuit, attack and bombardment aircraft but by the late 1920s the emphasis was shifting. 24 During the 1930s when the Norden bomb sight and new faster bomber aircraft designs became available, the belief of theorists based at the ACTS (by then at Maxwell Airbase, Alabama), such as Kenneth Walker, Donald Wilson, Laurence Kutter and Haywood Hansell, began to take shape and was to influence many World War IIcommanders, such as Curtis LeMay, Carl Spaatz and Ira Eaker. The new thinking was also prompted by the MacArthur–Pratt agreement between the US Navy and the US Army which delineated spheres of air power influence within the armed forces, andthe USAAC was now to be responsible for defending American shores with land  File: --- buckley_total.pdf --- Page 91 --- AIR POWER IN THE AGE OF TOTAL WAR 80based bombers. This of course required the army aircraft to be able to hit a moving target at sea and thus a premium was to be placed on bombing accuracy.25 Essentially, unlike the British, the Americans took a particularly industrial-economic view of bombing. T o their thinking, the key to bringing about success was to identify “key nodes” in the enemy economy and to target these for destruction by precision bombing. What these so called “key nodes” were and exactly how they would be destroyed remained to be developed, but the essence of US doctrine was already different to that of the RAF . This was reflected in intent, if not always in practice, in World War II. However, like the British, the US Air Corps believed slavishly in the ability of the bomber to by

Targeting cities and industrial centrescertainly appeared to make good strategic sense, but clearly there was far more to this issue than mere military expediency. Bombing urban centres, on whatever pretext, meant killing civilians and to many this was an unwelcome and immoral escalation ofthe already brutal activity of war. Y et, arguably, the conduct of war throughout history has been influenced less by morality and more by military capability, balanced by political acceptability. This in turn has been shaped by the objectives for which asociety was fighting. In total war environments, both the stakes and the military capability have been high, resulting in the use of previously unparalleled methods of waging war. Ultimately, the key factor for the legitimacy of a stratagem has been its effectiveness.Would it allow you to win and bring the war to a speedy conclusion? Aerial bombing clearly offered the greatest challenge to those who sought to limit war to military personnel. However, even before 1914, the distinction between combatantand non-combatant had become blurred and the scale of mass industrial war was often to render such notions worthless. Attempts to outlaw or limit the effects of bombing ultimately came to very little and, as has often been the case in war, technicalcapability and political need have usually dictated the level of violence in conflicts.
