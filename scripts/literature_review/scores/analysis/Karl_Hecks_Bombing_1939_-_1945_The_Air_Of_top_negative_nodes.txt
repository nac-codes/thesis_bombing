In 1934, the physicist Leo Szilard persuaded the British Admiralty to take out a secret patent on a nuclear chain reaction that would make an atomic explosion possible. But few people thought an A-bomb practical until, in January 1939, Prof. Otto Frisch and Dr Lise Meitner made the first public announcement of a laboratory demonstration of the fission of uranium 235U atoms by bombarding uranium with neutrons. It was Miss Meitner who first appreciated that fission was taking place, the 235U atoms being split into two smaller atoms with release of energy and more neutrons. Szilard (now in the USA), repeating the experiment in March 1939, saw that 'the World was heading for sorrow' [Kurzman, 1945:21]; a large enough mass (critical mass) of 235U could give a chain reaction, in which each neutron generated would cause further fission and more neutrons, so leading to an atomic explosion. Others noticed also. In France, a patent for a uranium bomb was filed. In the USSR, nuclear research received increased priority, under a committee set up to investigate the feasibility of an A-bomb. In Germany, physicists P. Harteck and W. Groth wrote to the German War Office on the possible use of nuclear energy as a military explosive, and the government quickly stopped the export of uranium ore from newly-occupied Czechoslovakia. Prompted by Szilard, in August 1939 the world's most respected scientist, Albert Einstein at Princeton, wrote to the US President F. D. Roosevelt urging intensive research towards developing a nuclear bomb before Nazi Germany did so.

Centred on Los Alamos, it was to result in two types of A-bomb, using uranium 235 and plutonium respectively. On 2 December, Dr Enrico Fermi achieved start-up with the world's first critical atomic pile, at the University of Columbia in Chicago. This paved the way for large scale production of plutonium. The first known statement on a possible thermonuclear or hydrogen bomb was made in May 1941 by Japanese physicist T.Hagiwara. In the USA in July 1942, Dr Edward Teller presented the first calculations showing how the million degree temperatures attained by an A-bomb could generate a fusion reaction. The bomb could utilize deuterium ('heavy hydrogen') in heavy water surrounding an A-bomb, the deuterium (2H) forming tritium (3H) then fusing to form helium, with accompanying release of enormous quantities of energy, giving a 'Super' A-bomb (or 'H' bomb) of almost unlimited power. Teller went on to lead the US H-bomb development which came to fruition after the war. German, Japanese and Soviet Nuclear Weapon Developments The Axis Powers were indeed working towards an atomic bomb, but at low priority. In Germany, nuclear physicists were now working under Prof. W. Heisenberg, at Hechingen. In March, Goebbels noted that: 'Research in the realm of atomic destruction has now proceeded to the point where its results may possibly be used in the present war.' The bomb bay of an He177 was enlarged to support A-bomb ballistic tests [Smith and Kay, 1972:287], but A-bomb development did not meet Hitler's requirements for rapid results, and in June, Speer approved preliminary nuclear work only. The prototype atomic piles at Kummersdorf and Haigersloch were still subcritical at the end of the war. The expectation that the Germans were more likely than the Japanese to achieve an A-bomb influenced the US adoption of a 'Germany first' war policy. But eleven days after Roosevelt

Interdiction 25 The intermediate bombing category was also the least controversial, although, again, the degree of air force integration with army direction varied markedly, from close co-operation (USSR, Germany) to determined indepen- dence (RAF). Interdiction involved tactical strikes against targets beyond the front line, mostly using twin-engined medium bombers. The French and Soviets planned attacks close to the front, the Germans, British and Japanese expected to use wider ranging attacks. The RAF, at least, had made limited exercises with night bombing at relatively low level. But it was generally assumed that attacks would be made by small groups of bombers, in daylight, using horizontal bombing from low/medium altitude, i.e. high enough to be above any light flak. The risk from fighters was not thought to be great because, compared with strategic bombing, the bombers themselves were mostly smaller and faster, the time spent in enemy airspace was less, and the range was more likely to be within the capacity of single-engine fighters to provide escort. But overall, there was a tendency to overestimate the ability to achieve decisive, accurate bombing of what were mainly relatively small targets. Strategic Bombing Long-range strategic bombing had appeared in World War One with raids on Britain by German Zeppelins and Gotha bombers. In the 1920s, preparation for strategic bombing had been strongly advocated by Maj. W. Mitchell in the USA, by Maj. Gen. Sir Hugh (later Lord) Trenchard in Britain, and to the exclusion of all else, by Gen. G. Douhet in Italy [Murray, 1985:9]. It was argued that strategic air power could by itself win a war, that there was no adequate defence against bombing, and hence that the best form of defence was the threat of retaliation in kind. In the 1930s only the USSR maintained a large fleet of four-engined bombers. But most of th

Bombing Categories Pre-war theories of air attacks against land targets envisaged three main categories, two tactical and one strategic: 21  22 PRE-WORLD WAR TWO BOMBING CONCEPTS AND TECHNIQUES (1) Close support to ground forces at the front line, attacking local concentrations of enemy troops and supplies, vehicles, strong points, etc., using mainly light bombers or purpose-built ground attack aircraft. (2) Interdiction at longer range to isolate the enemy on the battlefield from reinforcement and supply, by attacking his airfields, storage dumps, convoys and communications (railways, bridges, road junctions) beyond the front line, using mainly medium bombers. (3) Strategic, long-range heavy bombing of the enemy's heartland, against the main sources of his military power _ factories, shipyards, steelworks, power stations, rail centres. docks, etc. - and his civilian population centres, to destroy morale (it was imagined) and hence the will to wage war. Horizontal Bombing and Dive-bombing For bombing at speed in horizontal flight, the bomb had to be released well short of the target, using appropriate bomb- sight settings for aircraft speed and altitude, the ballistic characteristics of the bomb, and local wind. Bombing from medium/high altitude to avoid AA fire, small targets were difficult to hit, a factor which made conventional bombing questionable for close support, while also favouring the 'area bombing' of towns as against 'precision bombing' of key strategic targets.

Chemical, Biological and Nuclear Warfare Developments During World War One, some 63 different chemicals were used against personnel, incapacitating or killing by toxicit rather than by explosive energy. After the war, the USA and Japan declined to sign the League of Nations 'Geneva Gan Protocol' prohibiting the use of such weapons, but France Italy, Britain and the USSR all ratified it.

The bombing by Japan in China, by Italy in Abyssinia, and by the USSR, Italy, and especially Germany in Spain, filled the World with foreboding. Tactical bombing in support of ground troops was now joined by long-range bombing of towns as a weapon and a threat. A future war promised to be a people's war. Fleets of bombers could now rain explosive, incendiary and poison gas bombs down upon populations far from the front. The fear, combined with the rise of the totalitarian powers, brought variously new alliances, isolationism, pacifism, declarations of neutrality; and appeasement - the threat of Hitler's bombers brought him the coup at Munich. But the bombing which had taken place, largely by the totalitarian powers, had been either against ill-equipped adversaries or limited in scale.

The first two of the latter, tabun (cyanodimethy- 49 laminethoxphosphine oxide) and sarin (fluoroisopro- poxymethylphosphine oxide) had been discovered under Dr G. Schrader at I.G. Farben in Germany, in 1937 and 1938 respectively, while researching insecticides. They were, respectively, some ten and twenty times more lethal than previous chemical weapons, and totally unknown elsewhere. Chemical Bombs and Spraying Since the chemicals used were liquids which would evaporate to form a heavy toxic vapour, chemical bombs were purpose-built with tight sealing for handling and storage, and usually had some means of ejection or dispersion (e.g. air burst, spray, ground burst, or tail ejection) by explosive charge or compressed gas. At the outbreak of war, Germany had stockpiled 50kg KC50 bombs containing Green Cross and Yellow Cross chemicals; Britain had 30lb, 50lb and 250lb LC mustard gas bombs; Japan had developed parachute-dropped mustard gas spray bombs; and the French had a 200kg phosgene bomb and small mustard gas grenades dropped in clusters of 50. The Italians had mustard, phosgene and lewisite bombs, and for visually assessing wind strength and direction for optimizing chemical drops, introduced a 5kg Vento Marker in two versions, giving smoke for day use and a flame for night. Low-altitude spraying of chemicals from an aircraft in flight used a special sealed tank with dispensing pipes and nozzles, and compressed gas to force out the tank contents; some smoke-laying ca

But greater concentration on the destruction of rail and oil targets, once it became possible in 1943, would probably have brought earlier and serious damage to the German war output. Speer himself believed Germany was even more vulnerable to attacks on its chemical industry. As it was, real damage was eventually done in 1944 by the bombing of German oil installations and by long range US fighters and fighter-bombers destroying the Luftwaffe and ground transport. The Bombing of Japan The early Japanese expansion had served to establish a remote defence perimeter, to keep US bombers out of range of Japan. As a result, the bombing offensive against Japan was smaller and shorter than that against Germany. Of the total of 656,400 tons of bombs dropped by all forces in the Pacific theatre, US forces dropped 153,000 tons on Japan, 98,000 tons being incendiaries. The raids on Japan, which killed 392,000 civilians, only began in late 1944, when the Japanese economy was already in decline due to the US  SUMMING UP 288 SUMMING UP naval blockade. Early attacks on the shipbuilding and aircraft industries, plus six major urban/industrial areas, gave way to the area bombing of cities. This destroyed 2.2 million dwelling-houses, (excluding 0.6 million pulled down to provide fire breaks), compared with 3.6 million in Germany. Again, there was some increase in war production; and plans to move much of it underground were in progress. But the bombing brought surrender without the need for invasion: the A-bombs and the Soviet invasion of Japanese-held Manchuria seem to have been the 'last straws'. Unlike Germany, Japan had a head of state capable of a rational decision to end the suffering. The air war on the Eastern Front differed from that elsewhere in that the air power on both sides was used almost exclusively in direct support to the huge land war. On both sides, most aircraft losses were to enemy AA

Two of these, dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and trichlorophe- noxyacetic acid (later 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T) became the US Agent Orange air-sprayed defoliant used in the Vietnam War. [Hersh, 1968:99] Japanese and British BW Developments: Anthrax and Plague Weapons By 1940, the Japanese at Pingfan had tested BW aerial spraying devices, and nine different types of aircraft BW bomb. Two of the latter, the Uji and Ha fragmentation bombs both used anthrax spores. Reportedly, on 4 October 1940, a Japanese aircraft over Changteh in China dropped plague (Bacillus pestis) contaminated wheat and rice grains in what may have been the first operational BW drop. Sporadic Japanese BW air raids in China continued into 1942, mostly with devices incorporating plague bacteria. [Harris and Paxman, 1982:78,80] Reports of these raids spurred Allied BW development. Britain's Porton Down had already been working on BW vaccines. In 1940, work began on BW weapons themselves, under Dr P.Fildes. The initial project was for a small, anthrax-impregnated cattle-cake, to be be dropped by RAF bombers to infect the enemy's livestock. This was apparently the world's first mass-produced biological weapon, some five million eventually being made. They were not used operationally, and were incinerated after the war.

Peierls in Britain, prepared two secret memoranda on a 235U bomb. These advocated secret development work before the Germans, and for the first time: envisaged two hemispheres of 235U, brought together by springs to achieve the 'critical mass'; spelled out its potential (' ... a 5kg bomb would be equivalent to several thousand tons of dynamite'); highlighted the lethality of the radiation: 'radioactive material will kill everybody within a strip estimated to be several miles long ... '; and noted that 'the only defence would be the deterrent effect of possessing such bombs oneself'. With 'heavy water' (D2O) usable to slow neutrons to aid 235U fission, the entire stock of the Norsk Hydro-Electric Company in Norway, the world's sole producer, was smuggled to France, then Britain. But the occupation of Norway and Belgium enabled the Germans to increase production of heavy water at the Norsk plant and to seize Belgium's stocks of uranium ore. In Germany itself, the Army allocated funding for atomic research, under Dr K. Diebner at Kummersdorf. For the Allies, the Norsk plant, especially, was to become a vital target. In the USA, in June 1940, a secret Advisory Committee on Uranium addressed the construction of an atomic pile, while US agents began quietly buying up what was left of the world's supply of uranium ore.

Chemical Weapons Developments; Spray Glide-bomb; Anti-crop Chemicals In September 1939, the British and French agreed with the Germans, via Swiss mediation, to abide by the Geneva protocol and not use poison gas. But the Poles reported the dropping of mustard gas on Warsaw, and the Germans claimed the Poles used British-supplied chemical weapons against them. On 19 September, a speech by Hitler warned of 'fearsome new weapons', possibly the nerve gases, for which a secret new plant at Dyhernfurth was authorized in that same month. The Allies, who failed to develop such weapons throughout the war, assumed the speech was a bluff. In 1940, Britain's Porton Down Establishment was developing a 'Flying Cow' unguided glide bomb, intended to dispense a swath of mustard gas drops during its descent [Harris and Paxman, 1982:52]. It seems the 400lb weapon was later stockpiled and supplied to the US 8th AF. The principal new Allied chemical weapons of the war were anti-crop chemicals. In 1940, in Britain, aerial spray  64 1939-40 tests of herbicide types 1313 and 1414, developed by ICI, showed 1lb per acre could destroy most crops by arresting growth; stockpiling was begun. Proposals to contaminate (rather than to destroy) crops, by spreading toxic chemicals, e.g. arsenic, were also made. A 1941 plan to have Bomber Command saturate German food-growing areas with chemicals was shelved because of the large scale of operations needed, and because Britain was judged vulnerable to attacks in kind, whereas the Germans had wide access to crops in the occupied countries. [Harris and Paxman, 1982:98] Later in the war, the US Fort Detrick developed new anti-crop chemicals having a hormone-like effect on plants, causing them to grow rapidly and die.

In the 1930s only the USSR maintained a large fleet of four-engined bombers.

But some  PRE-WORLD WAR TWO 26 BOMBING CONCEPTS AND TECHNIQUES rethinking then followed, not least because heavy bombers were so expensive to build and to operate. In the Spanish Civil War, both the Germans and the Soviets had engaged in limited bombing operations with a strategic element, including attacks on civilian populations, using medium bombers. But both were land powers, aware that diversion of huge resources for a strategic bombing force would leave the Army weakened, and that an early Army defeat could lose them a war before a strategic [Murray bombing campaign could become decisive. 1985:15] Nations with sea protection (Japan, Britain, USA) had more freedom to emphasize strategic bombing. But the experience in Spain led the Germans and the Soviets to conclude that for them, tactical support to the Army should come first. Medium bombers could be built in larger numbers, were more versatile, and could be used for strategic bombing if required. In Japan, the Navy rather than the AAF advocated strategic bombing, and on 14 August 1937, it carried out the World's first transoceanic bombing raid, Mitsubishi G3M2 twin-engined bombers from Taipei flying 1,250 miles overwater to strike targets near Hangchow and Kwangteh. The RAF and USAAC remained the principal advocates of strategic bombing. But whereas the RAF was building largely for area bombing as a deterrent, the USAAC saw precision bombing of oil and power plants, etc. as an economical approach to war; a relatively small force could quickly disrupt the enemy's war capacit
