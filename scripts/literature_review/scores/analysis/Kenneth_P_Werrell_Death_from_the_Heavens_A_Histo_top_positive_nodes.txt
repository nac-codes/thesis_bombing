The Schweinfurt raid of 230 Forts, led by its commander, Brig. Gen. Robert Wil- liams, met even tougher resistance.17 One reason was that fighters the Germans shifted westward for the anticipated return of the 4th were in excellent position to meet the 1st's effort. The unit did not bomb as well as the Regensburg force due in part to the defenses, bombing three thousand feet higher than usual, and congestion on the bomb run. Nevertheless, production in Schweinfurt in September and October was cut by one-third. Despite these losses the AAF persisted and continued to be savaged by GAF defenses and thwarted by the weather. On a September 6 mission against ball bearing plants in Stuttgart, weather allowed only 46 of 338 bombers to (poorly) bomb the target. The Eighth encountered fewer than two hundred fighters, yet the German defense along with the range and weather resulted in forty-five bombers lost in action, five interned in Switzerland, and three written off as wrecks.

Anderson delayed the 4th's movement as long as possible (ninety minutes) to enable it to get to Africa before dusk. The 4th got off, but the weather at the 1st's bases remained too poor for take- off.15 Anderson decided to launch the 4th separately because of the importance of the target, the fickle weather, and the fear that the recent raids would encourage the Luft- waffe to reinforce its Regensburg defenses.

Tupolev reportedly regarded his bold design as one of his "less fortunate creations." The aircraft served in bombing, recon- naissance, ECM, and missile carrying (with the Kh-22 cruise missile semienclosed) roles, with the latter becoming its primary function. In 1965 the Soviets added aileron fences to solve the aileron reversal problem, changed to slightly more powerful engines, and fitted aerial refueling equipment to a number of the aircraft. Despite the accidents, short range, and limited payload capacity, the Soviets built 311 Blinders, and prior to the Soviet breakup in 1991, they had 155 to 180 Blinders in service.

SAC considered these ideas to be an interim solution until air-to-air defensive missiles became avail- able.19 After seemingly constant delays and a number of problems, the decision makers settled on a manned tail turret armed with quadruple .50s that simplified sighting and was more reliable, although the installation added weight, complexity, and cost.

In the event the Boeing design failed, the airmen also awarded Consolidated a contract for the B-32 (see below). The design the airmen finally bought in 1940 was a considerable change from the B-17. The bomber featured tricycle landing gear, a high-aspect-ratio wing, and giant flaps to lower takeoff and landing speeds. Although the Superfortress was larger and twice the weight of the Fort, its perfor- mance was markedly superior because it had the same drag as the B-17 and 83 percent more engine power. Defensive armament was also greater, with four turrets (two atop and two beneath the bomber), each with two .50-caliber machine guns and a tail position mounting twin .50s and a single 20-mm cannon. The Superfort introduced three signifi- cant innovations into strategic bombers. The first was to add a flight engineer, who despite the protests of pilots who were con- cerned about not having full instrumenta- tion at their position, greatly aided in flying this large and complex aircraft. A second major improvement was cabin pressuriza- tion, which allowed the crew to operate at altitude without oxygen masks. The third innovation was the gunnery system: four turrets remotely controlled by gunners posi- tioned in sighting blisters. Besides improving streamlining this system removed the gunner from the noise and vibration of the firing and allowed the master gunner to switch control of the turrets among the gunners, Engines were the bomber's most serious problem and would dog it throughout its service.

The four-engine Boeing bomber was what the airmen were looking for, an aircraft that could fly high, fast, and far; fight off aerial defenders with its heavy armament; and deliver bombs on target. The story becomes dramatic and tragic, however, for after setting a cross- country nonstop speed record from Seattle to Dayton, the prototype was destroyed in a takeoff accident (due to pilot error) in October 1935. Instead of a hoped-for buy of sixty-five aircraft, the Air Corps got only a baker's dozen, while the Army bought a larger number of the more conservative, cheaper, and much less capable twin-engine B-18.2 Meanwhile the War Department pushed close support aircraft and restricted experimental and development funds for fiscal years 1939 and 1940 to close support aircraft. Thus between October 1935 and July 1939, the Air Corps procured only 14 heavy bombers, 13 B-17s and 1 B-15, despite requests for 206 of the former and 11 of the latter. 101 Over the years Boeing modified and improved the Flying Fortress. The first model to see combat was the B-17C, a model that replaced all but one gun with .50-caliber machine guns and added self- sealing tanks and armor. Nevertheless the B-17C proved wanting in RAF opera- tions over Europe beginning in July 1941. However, these were very useful combat trials pointing out a number of the bomber's deficiencies. The B-17D, basically the same aircraft, did no better against the Japanese early in the Pacific war. The "E" model addressed many of these shortcomings. The most visible change was a redesigned empennage with a dorsal fin that began amidships and flared into the large signature "big tail," which permitted the addition of a tail gun position and increased stabil- ity, especially at high altitudes.

Probably the raid's most important positive result was that it forced the Germans to divert resources to defend this vital target. The other mission two and a half weeks later and on the first anniversary of AAF operations from Britain was against two key targets, bearing plants at Schweinfurt and a fighter factory at Regensburg. As early as 1941 the British had considered attack- ing bearings, which appeared to be an ideal target because they were indispensable in all mechanized military equipment and produc- tion was concentrated in seven plants that turned out 80 percent of German bearings. The plants at Schweinfurt were believed to produce half of the total Axis bearing production and were listed for attack in the CBO plan. In early August British and American planners generated a plan that called for an AAF day raid followed by an RAF night assault, but bad weather foiled this effort. Therefore the Eighth proceeded alone, combining the Schweinfurt mission with an attack on another high-priority  CHAPTER 5 U.S. STRATEGIC BOMBING IN EUROPE 113 target, an aircraft factory at Regensburg. The plan called for one unit (4th Wing) to hit the more distant Regensburg target and, in a first, fly on to Africa. The 4th would be followed by the 1st Wing, which would strike three factories in Schweinfurt and then return to Britain. The planners expected that the Regensburg mission would attract the bulk of the defenders inbound to the target and then surprise the defenders when it exited to the south. Meanwhile the Schweinfurt force would slip toward its target while the GAF was distracted.

Powered by six rather than five engines, they were more powerful, more streamlined, better protected (by as many as ten machine guns), and could carry five tons of bombs. Nevertheless these were little faster and flew at about the same altitude as their predecessors.6 In late November 1916 British aircraft downed two zeppelins. As a consequence the head of the naval airship detachment wrote, "Machine guns are no defence for the airship against aeroplanes ... [therefore] 'attack only with cloud cover.'"7 The navy concluded that the best defense against interceptors was Higher altitude operations introduced new problems. They subjected the crew to both the cold and anoxia, and while the air- ships carried compressed oxygen, they did not carry heating devices. Higher altitude operations made navigation more difficult; caused engine problems; froze instruments, water ballast, and lubricants; shattered cellu- loid windows; made the craft's fabric brittle; and caused control cables to stick. Never- theless the increased altitude could render the defending craft impotent as fighters used through 1917 had ceilings below thir- teen thousand feet.

American reassessments reduced this figure to twenty-one destroyed while German sources indicate a loss of only two fighters.

A reassessment in early January 1943 reduced the previous overall figure of 223 GAF fighters destroyed to 89. Nevertheless, German records indicate that even this figure was too high. airmen did recognize there were problems, the most serious of which were inadequate training and the weather. These difficulties were compounded by three outside events.

It was a small aircraft that was quickly designed, built, and flown; possessed unusual performance; and was conceived as a cheap substitute for the B-29. It had a wing span of seventy-one feet and weighed a mere twenty-one thousand pounds empty and had a takeoff gross weight of thirty-six thousand pounds.

One of the most significant improvements was to arm the night fighters with heavier forward firing cannon (up to 30 mm) and twin upward firing cannon. The latter, code named Schrage Musik (slanting, or jazz music), achieved its first kill in May 1943 and went into service in the fall of 1943. It allowed the night fighters to approach the bombers in their blind spot, below and behind the bomber using the earth's darker background to mask their presence from the bomber's tail gunner (few British bombers had ventral gunners). It was very effective. On the other hand, the GAF were unable to upgrade to more capable aircraft. The Me 210 turned out badly, and a more capable night fighter, the He 219, was shunned, delayed, and only appeared in small numbers, which forced the Luftwaffe to rely on the older and less capable Ju 88G. Bomber losses increased from below 4 percent of those dispatched for the period July through November 1943 to over that figure for the following three months. And while the monthly loss rate in March 1944 declined to 3.1 percent, Bomber Com- mand suffered two clear defeats against Berlin (March 24, seventy-two bombers, 8.8 percent) and Nuremberg (March 30, ninety- four bombers, 11.8 percent). Even with the change of targets brought on by the Nor- mandy invasion and the decline in monthly losses (less than 2.5 percent after March 31), the RAF continued to suffer high losses in attacks on Germany, 8.4 percent on July 28 for example. Despite these successes early in the year, the Luftwaffe lost both day and night air superiority during 1944.

The USAF was especially concerned about the Flying Wing's stability during bomb runs. In October 1948 tests conducted along with a B-29 its pilots reported it was "extremely unstable" and that "it was impossible to hold a steady course or a constant airspeed and altitude."2 The Flying Wing had twice the bombing error of the Superfort, which supported the airmen's general view that the Northrop aircraft was unsuitable for either bombing or recon- naissance work.

The Luftwaffe was prepared for night attacks fielding a Pathfinder Force trained to mark targets for the main force using a bad weather/night navigation system (Knick- ebein) that was accurate within five hundred yards.

B-17s dropped 60 percent of the bombs dropped by U.S. heavy bombers in Europe. (U.S. Naval Institute Archive) Compared to the B-17, the Consolidated B-24 was built in larger numbers, was much more versatile, and had some performance advantages. But it did not receive as much publicity or praise because it lacked the Fort's ruggedness, looks, and easy handling. Its most famous operation was the August 1943 low-level Ploesti raid seen here.

The slab side, boxcar-like, broad fuselage could accommodate up to eight thousand pounds of bombs and endowed the aircraft with great versatil- ity but did not enhance its appearance. The bomber made its initial flight in Decem- ber 1939, a remarkably short time after its 103 inception. The aircraft's major virtues were range and versatility.

The bombers remained in service into the late 1980s when they were removed in accordance with arms-control agreements. It made its last flight in the mid-1990s. In a similar fashion the Myasish- chev M-50/M-52 Bounder was the The Tupolev Tu-22 Blinder was similar to the B-58 in terms of performance, roles, rewards (record-breaking flights and great publicity), and risks (high accident rates). However, although both developed at about the same time they were much differ- ent in appearance. Tupolev's entry into the supersonic bomber field began with an August 1954 study for a supersonic bomber. The final version had a sharply swept wing, needle nose, and twin engines mounted on either side of its vertical tail. The engine arrangement was a departure from the tradi- tional, and while it had some advantages, it added weight (15 percent) and complicated maintenance by its location. Three men positioned in tandem crewed the bomber, which was defended by a remotely con- trolled tail turret mounting first two 23-mm cannons and later one 23 mm.36 Although the prototype first flew in June 1958, a few months earlier the Soviets allowed a basic redesign to incorporate the area rule. This model made its first flight in September 1959 and testing encouraged the Soviets to authorize production before the year was out. Pilots found the bomber (Right) The Tu-22 Blinder was similar to the B-58 as both set many records and had high accident rates. The Blinder was distinguished by its unusual engine configuration, two engines mounted on the vertical tail. However, the air and ground crews disliked the bomber because of its poorly designed cockpit, dangerous flying characteristics, and unreliability.

Two F-111s were lost, one believed to have flown into the sea when its navigational equipment failed and one to small-arms fire that ruptured the hydraulic system, a case of a "golden BB." So while the aircraft's combat performance improved from the 1968 debut, it still was not up to what might be expected from such a sophisticated machine. But there would be other days and other wars. GD built a bomber version of the F-111 for SAC. The slow development of the advanced manned strategic aircraft (AMSA, later B-1), insurance against a major B-52 "catastrophe," along with the prospect of early B-52 retirement, pushed the USAF as early as 1963 to consider acquiring an interim bomber, a decision the secretary of defense announced in December 1965. SAC was hostile to the F-111 because it wanted the B-70. Two colonels sent by LeMay to brief the SAC commander on the GD aircraft were admonished and kicked off the base. That did not change events. Although SAC sought a bomber with minimum The General Dynamics FB-111 was an enlarged version of the controversial F-111. Initially SAC did not want this bomber, although it had some flying and tactical advantages over its serving bombers. Here the bomber has its wings in the full forward position with four SRAM missiles underwing. (National Museum of the USAF) 229 changes from the fighter version in order to get it into service as quickly as possible, the secretary of defense wanted better than that. Thus compared with the F-111 the FB-111 had longer wings and fuselage, larger fuel tanks, more powerful engines, and a strengthened landing gear to allow greater weights.11 While it had capabilities superior to the B-47 and B-58, it lacked the bomb load, range, and crew the Air Force desired. The FB-111 made its maiden flight in July 1967. The bomber showed its promise when in its first appearance it took top honors in bombing at SAC's 1970 combat competition and went on to win a number of these annual

The airships were underpowered when all engines were running at peak performance and certainly had problems when any failed or were not producing full power. horns from a phonograph player attached to a pivoting pole and connected to a doctor's stethoscope. At least some of these devices were manned by blind individuals with acute hearing. Later the defenders built at least four concrete sound reflectors, fifteen feet in diameter, that could detect aircraft at a range of six to eight miles and perhaps as far as twelve to fifteen miles. Sound detec- tion (and tracking) was the best available technology of the day, although it was short ranged, fickle, and unreliable. There were also the enemy air defenses. The airships were large and slow and relatively easy to spot in clear weather. They lacked a speed advantage over aircraft, although initially they could climb faster and higher than the defending fighters. The zep- pelin's slow speed and large size gave antiair- craft artillery gunners, as well as infantrymen and machine gunners, a much easier target than aircraft, and the use of hydrogen made the airships vulnerable. Of the fifty-three or so naval airships lost during the war, at least ten were downed by fighters and eight by ground fire. Some of the other losses may have resulted from damage suffered from either or both of these agents, but clearly weather and mechanical problems were a major cause of losses. Initially British fighters lacked adequate armament to down the airships. The defend- ers used bombs and darts, but these required the fighter to get above the zeppelin, brave defensive fire, and accurately release the missiles, not an easy task. Grapnels and ram- ming were considered, while flare pistols and grenade launchers proved useless. The standard British .303-caliber machine-gun ammunition proved ineffective, leading to the invention of incendiary bullets that could ignite the hydrogen. These went into action in the summer
