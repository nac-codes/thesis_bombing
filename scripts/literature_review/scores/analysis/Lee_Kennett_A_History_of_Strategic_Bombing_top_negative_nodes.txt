When John Slessor took up strategic bombing, he told his readers that "the moral issue should be borne in mind as a background to the consideration of the narrower-but probably not less impor-  54 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE PROPHETS tant-aspect of the problem, the dislocation and restriction by air action of the supply of war material at the source."" By the "moral issue," Slessor meant morale, but although he mentioned it, he devoted his attention exclusively to the material effects of bombing. Spaight came to grips with the ethical issue in several books. He was obviously troubled over the morality of attacks on the civilian pop- ulation, and the twists and turns in his thinking are visible in his works. He presented the rationale for such attacks clearly and suc- cinctly: "It is the sovereign people who will war today, and it is their nerve and morale that must be broken. The great cities are convenient assemblages of the sovereign people; therefore smash the cities and you smash the will to war."20 Writing in 1924, Spaight was sure this bombing policy would work: "No amount of composure, no surplusage of bull-dog tenacity can save a people raided copiously, scientifically. systematically."21 Six years later he was not so sure: "The difficulty is that you may not smash the will to war. You may only harden it, intensify it."22 In 1924, Spaight could justify assaults on the cities, on the grounds that they would decide the war quickly and thus actually save lives; the slaughter, he said, would be "as nothing compared with that of the older war."23 But, by 1930, attacks on urban populations were repugnant to Spaight. He called them "bad work for civilization" and he concentrated his efforts on preventing them.24 Spaight's dozen books on military aviation are reposit

No less an author- ity than Marshal Foch told Groves that a massive air attack could have such "a crushing moral effect on a nation" that its government would find itself disarmed.16 H. A. Jones, writing in the official history of the RAF, even suggested that the Germans could have provoked an emotional tidal wave in London, had they played their cards more astutely: "A German night-bombing campaign against London in February or early in March, 1918, might have had results leading to a popular clamour which the government might have found them- selves unable to withstand."17 This would be, in effect, a variant of the "knockout blow"; the bombers do not attack the centers of power directly, but instead, they set the masses in motion against those cen- ters. In either case the outcome would be the same: the paralysis of the enemy, followed by his capitulation. Even if it were an infallible means to victory, a bombing policy whose sole purpose was to demoralize the enemy's population would have been extremely difficult to defend in the period between the wars. Understandably enough in the aftermath of the slaughter of 1914-18, the public regarded any method of war designed to terrorize the civil- ian population as morally indefensible, and a number of air power the- orists felt the same way. Some theorists preferred to link the concept of morale bombing with the more acceptable one of making war on the enemy's industries and other points sensibles. The actual purpose of strategic bombing became twofold: to deprive the enemy of both the material means and the will to continue the war. Even then, Billy Mitchell often spoke of the goals of strategic bombardment in curi- ously veiled terms; he mentions, for example, targets in the enemy's territory "which are further back than his troops are."18 Others used the euphemism "direct action" for attacks directed at the enemy's capital.

Bertha von Suttner fiercely denounced what she called the "bar- barization of the air," which would make war a totally different game: "We want to keep the old rules, where the pawns can take only one move and the knight can jump; where the queen is the most powerful piece and the king can "castle" to protect himself. But now we have new rules: each of us may have something drop on our squares from above, something that will blow the pieces off the gaming board."2 In England two hundred prominent figures put their names to a memo- rial calling for the suppression of aerial weapons before they spread further; among the signers were Thomas Hardy, Lord Lister, A. Conan Doyle, H. G. Wells, and ten Anglican bishops. In Austria, Vik- tor Silberer, editor of the Wiener Luftschiffer-Zeitung and a balloon- ing enthusiast for thirty years, denounced "aerial militarism" as the  60 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING BANNING THE BOMBER 61 work of unscrupulous aircraft manufacturers, "especially the French."3 When the nations of Europe rushed to arms in 1914, the martial mood and the confidence in rapid victory ended for a time all talk of banning or limiting the use of aerial weapons. But, as the conflict wore on, and as the bombing planes began to carry the war behind the bat- tle lines and into the cities, other voices were raised against the spread of violence. First, there were the neutrals. In the autumn of 1914. Woodrow Wilson sought through his ambassador to Berlin to prevent the bombing of Allied cities. Pope Benedict XV made several over- tures to the belligerents. Early in 1916, after the bombing of Ravenna. he appealed to both Italy and Austria to respect open cities; a spokes- man for the pope said, "He wishes even more than that-that the use of aeroplane bombs in the Austro-Italian War could be entirely dis- pensed with."4 In the last year of the war, the Span

A rain of bombs was less bearable to human beings than a salvo of artillery. These notions were virtually articles of faith by 1914, and they would linger to color the thought of later generations of strategists. The unique potential for destruction that made the bomber a prom- ising weapon also made it a dangerous one. Any number or people saw the danger before 1914: aerial bombing could extend death and destruction far beyond the customary parameters of warfare, erasing "the distinction between combatant and civilian, between war zone and hinterland. At the Hague conference of 1907 the nations involved chose to permit aerial bombing of military objectives. In doing so, they virtually assured that the practice would spread and intensify, for the threshold to "illegal" bombing was not clearly marked. The air weapon might conceivably have been banned altogether while still in embryo; what helped save it was the argument that actually it repre- sented "progress" in warfare, a means to bring speed and precision to military operations and thus make wars less bloody. This notion too would linger. In the 1920s, Mitchell and Douhet argued that a war decided in the air would be a merciful substitute for the hell of the trenches. And arguments about the economy and the humanity of the air war continued to be heard into World War II. Initially, much of the talk was about the fabled knockout blow, which would stun a bel- ligerent in the first hours of conflict, delivering him up to the will of  180 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES THE BOMBING WAR IN RETROSPECT the attacker with a saving of lives and property all around; later, when the war was well under way, advocates of the strategic-bombing offen- sive put forth a more modest claim: it would save lives on "our" side The Great War scarcely gave the strategic bomber a chance to do more than try its wings; at the close of the conflict, it was a weapon imperfectly

The Americans wanted to make a sharp distinc- tion between bombing in, and outside of, the "combat area" with the latter being severely restricted. The Japanese and the Dutch, whose countries had a small area and dense populations, wanted the most thorough protection for cities and towns. The Italians wanted the air- men who bombed illegal targets brought to trial personally on charges of having committed acts of perfidy. The Hague conferees ultimately agreed on a set of "Rules of Aerial Warfare," comprising sixty-two articles, of which five related to bom- bardment. The three most important were the following: Article 22 .- Aerial bombardment for the purpose of terrorizing the civilian population, of destroying or damaging private property not of a military character, or of injuring non-combatants, is prohibited. Article 23 .- Aerial bombardment for the purpose of enforcing compliance with requisitions in kind or payment of contributions in money is prohibited. Article 24 .- (1) Aerial bombardment is legitimate only when directed at a military objective, that is to say, an object of which the destruction or injury would constitute a distinct military advantage to the belligerent. (2) Such bombardment is legitimate only when directed exclu- sively at the following objectives: military forces; military works; mil- itary establishments or depots; factories constituting important and well-known centres engaged in the manufacture of arms, ammunition, or distinctively military supplies; lines of communication or transpor- tation used for military purposes. (3) The bombardment of cities, towns, villages, dwellings, or build- ings not in the immediate neighbourhood of the operations of land 65 forces is prohibited.

Toward the end of the war Lord Weir, the British air minister, told Trenchard that he need not be overly concerned at the inaccuracies involved in bombing German towns. Trenchard replied, "All the pilots drop their eggs well into the center of the town generally."14 Such comments by military personnel may seem reprehensible, but they at least understood the technical problems involved. The press, the public, and many politicians did not. When enemy bombs aimed  A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING 34 THE GREAT WAR at a barracks fell into residential areas all around it, these groups called the attack indiscriminate or terroristic and demanded reprisals. There is no doubt that a number of bombing attacks on cities were essentially symbolic; they were undertaken mainly for political rea- sons-to embarrass the enemy and frighten him, and at the same time to provide stirring headlines for domestic consumption. It became a sort of game to demonstrate that the enemy's cities-particularly his capital-were vulnerable. Every belligerent capital in Europe was attacked from the air except Rome-no doubt because of the pope's presence. Even then the Austrians made it a point to fly near the city on their raids to Naples and other targets. As out of the way as Con- stantinople might seem, the French, British, and Russians all man- aged to bomb it. Petrograd escaped for a long time, but only because it was at extreme range. The Germans planned to attack it quite early by zeppelin (they needed a long winter night, mild winds, and mod- erate temperatures, but were never able to find these optimum con- ditions on the eastern front). When Italy entered the war, Col. Giulio Douhet wanted to lead a squadron of Caproni bombers over Vienna and drop empty bombs on Schoenbrunn castle as a lesson in "power and chivalry."15 The poet- aviator D'Annunzio tried unsuccessfully to make the flight in 1917, succeeding only in August 1918.

Photographic intelligence could not tell them all they needed to know, and stories coming from enemy countries had to be heavily discounted. In this sense, both Allies were bombing blind. There was an even more fundamental shortcoming in intelligence: failure to perceive the excess capacity, the unused resources, and the "fat" that characterized the German econ- omy well into the war. When Allied bombers began serious efforts to apply the brakes to German production in 1943, Albert Speer was just moving it into high gear. Well into 1944, his efforts effectively coun- teracted theirs. All of the bombing offensives of the war, including that which the Luftwaffe waged against England in 1940-41, seem to have been launched with the expectations of quick and tangible results; when those results did not come, the bombers were directed against another target system and then another. But probably no target proved so frus- trating, so elusive as morale. At some point, the offensive came to include this target, and at times, the chief objective of the raid was to demoralize the enemy civilian, to panic him, or, if necessary, to kill him. The punishment administered could be extremely severe: as a result of American bombing on dual targets, Japan suffered more casualties among its civilian population than among its armed forces on the fighting front. From Goering's Operation Seaside at the begin- ning of the war to Clarion and Thunderclap toward its end, there were innumerable schemes to produce a massive and debilitating shock to the enemy's population. The bombing of Rome was carried out largely for its shock value, as was the nuclear attack on Hiroshima. In these cases a shock certainly was produced, but it added to pressures already building on the Italian and Japanese governments, so its exact role is impossible to determine.

The panic produced by Orson Welles's "War of the Worlds" broadcast in 1938 seemed to others an indication of the hysteria a sudden air attack would generate. Some theorized that the vibrations of the bombs would overtax the human nervous system, and others believed the most deadly effect would be produced by "silent" attacks in which the bombers glided over the city with their engines off. But, to many writers, the worst weapon was the one that had never been used on cities-gas. A fleet of bombers equipped with aerial spray apparatus similar to that used for insecticides might glide over a city in the dead of night, releasing a "dew of death." No new weapons of terror made their appearance in the conflicts that dominated the headlines of the late thirties, but those already known seemed somehow more menacing. The photograph of a Chinese baby crying amidst the debris of a bomb-shattered city is arresting even today, while the attack on the Spanish town of Guer- nica generated a seismic wave of horror. The air aspects of the Spanish Civil War come in for close scrutiny for the hints they provide about the effectiveness of bombing. John Langdon-Davies, who witnessed the attacks on Barcelona early in 1938, felt that the excitable nature and incorrigible curiosity of the Spaniards would be their undoing: "They would not take shelter. They preferred instead to blacken every balcony so as to get a good view of the bursting shrapnel."7 Another observer, this one a British expert on civil defense, confirmed this impression: "There has been no stampede in mass of the whole of a nerve-wracked population.

He then proceeded to prove that this policy was militarily sound, the best way to use aircraft in war, and not "contrary either to inter- national law or to the dictates of humanity." At the outset, the air force might contend with the enemy air fleet for air superiority, but this contest would be largely incidental to striking the key objectives, the enemy's "centers of production, transportation and communica- tion." Trenchard went on to describe the proper targets: production facilities for everything "from boots to battleships," rail systems,  76 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE RISE OF THE AIR FLEETS 77 docks and shipyards, wireless stations, and postal and telegraph systems. Trenchard went to some pains to explain that this sort of bombard- ment was neither illegal nor inhumane. The indiscriminate bombing of a city for the purpose of terrorizing its inhabitants was improper. but striking at legitimate military targets within that city and causing "incidental destruction of civilian life and property" was altogether acceptable. Trenchard argued that it was legitimate to frighten away workers in war industries, since their work was part of the enemy war effort. This "moral" effect was a sort of bonus to be added to the mate- rial destruction achieved, but in Trenchard's view, it might be of greater importance. Civilians were primarily vulnerable to assault on their state of mind: "They are not disciplined and it cannot be expected of them that they will stick stolidly to their lathes and benches under the recurring threat of air bombardment." He spoke of generating "a state of panic" and cited examples of work stoppages in Germany in 1918. To buttress h

In a future war the bombers would be drawn inexorably to cities and industrial centers; as in the last war, they would find convenient "mil- itary" targets to aim for in both places, even though they would not be able to hit them. Here Spaight quoted a French pilot of the Great War: "In the war reports there are always passages which make one smile, such as the dropping of ten bombs from a height of 2000 meters [6,600 feet] upon 'military establishments.'"10 Yet, Spaight could not accept the idea that aerial warfare might degenerate into what he called "strong cave-man stuff." He felt that in the next war most long-distance bombing would be done by night, and he hoped that an understanding could be reached whereby the night bombers could come and strike the vital centers, both political  - BANNING THE BOMBER j A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING id economic, while the bulk of the population was not in them. The example that Spaight gave was the City of London. The day popula- tion of its 675 acres was over four hundred thousand people; at night that figure dropped to fourteen thousand. If arrangements could be made to lodge those fourteen thousand elsewhere, the City would become an area in which enemy bombers could do enormous material damage, but at the same time spare human life. "In brief," wrote Spaight, "I will give you property to destroy, if you will give me life to save."11 Spaight also found another reason for hope, one that perhaps only an Englishman could find. He dwelt at some length on the spirit of chivalry that had appeared in the various air services during the war. This might well be encouraged by requiring, for example, that an offi- cer be in command of each airplane.

One of the American advisers at the Hague meeting was Capt. William C. Sherman, who was at the time an instructor in air tactics at the Command and General Staff School, Fort Leavenworth. Sher- man held to the notion that considerations of fair play and humanity would mitigate the horrors of the next war in the air: "Among peoples in whom the spirit of sport has been strongly inculcated, it is peculiarly abhorrent to contemplate the waging of war on unarmed civilians of all ages and sexes."12 In a more practical vein, he felt that the fear of reprisal would keep the air war from degenerating into indiscriminate attacks on the cities. These restraints seemed to him more likely to be effective than the Hague rules. The skepticism that both Spaight and Sherman felt about the Hague rules was probably shared by a good many of the other tech- nical delegates. As the Draft Rules became known, the reaction to them in military and aviation circles was sometimes emphatically hos- tile. C. G. Grey, editor of the Aeroplane, wrote in the issue of July 11, 1923, that the only practical result of the bombing code would be to "cramp the style" of the RAF at the beginning of a war: "If we go bang into the next war all hair and teeth and blood, as the saying goes, free from any fetters of rules and regulations, we may achieve quite useful results at the start." Such considerations as these probably impressed the governments of the interwar period. In any event, there was no rush to ratify the Hague rules. By 1939 they still were draft rules only and not legally binding on any of the belligerents; still, in 67 the first months of the conflict they were voluntarily observed by those belligerents. The idea of a code of bombing rules had to vie with another concept that enjoyed considerable popularity in the interwar period, that of an international air force.

The quickest way to victory was through ter- ror. If light bombing produced panic-and here Douhet was impressed above all by the reported effects of bombing on the popu- lation of London-then massive bombing would create mass hysteria He placed great importance on the use of gas bombs, going so far as to say that his theories would not be valid if gas was not a successful weapon. He estimated that a modest air fleet of three hundred bomb- ers, each carrying two tons of gas bombs, could kill fifty thousand peo- ple in each of ten different cities, and in eight missions the fleet would account for 4 million deaths in eighty different localities. This "terri- fying offensive" would kill only one out of ten people in any given locality, but it would make life unbearable for the other nine and force the enemy population to its knees. 27 This appalling vision did not go unchallenged. The publication of a second edition of Command of the Air in 1927 created a storm of controversy in the Regia Aeronautica (the 1921 edition seems to have been largely ignored).

The planes were to bomb military targets in and around the city and make noisy demonstrations in the skies above it.

The plan was given serious study at General Joffre's headquarters but was never imple- mented. So the aerial "knockout blow," as it was often called, remained in the realm of theoretical possibilities; like the lightning stroke at the enemy air force, it was often evoked in the literature of the 1920s and 1930s. Clément Ader, who was in many ways the most perceptive of all the early writers on aerial warfare, foresaw that the threat to the cities would become an important consideration in state policy and that no country would feel the danger more than England: "She, more than any other, will be compelled by aviation to undergo a radical trans- formation."6 Concern over the vulnerability of their great capital city  44 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE PROPHETS 45 would lead the English to abandon their traditional isolation and to seek mastery of the atmosphere just as they had sought dominance of the seas. In addition to his remarkable prescience, Ader was noteworthy because of his idea that a nation could feel secure from an attack only if it could dominate the element through which that attack must come. The only answer to an enemy's air force is an air force of one's own. These forces would contend for mastery of the atmosphere in ways still unclear (although Ader and others speculated on the forms that aerial combat might take); but the war in the air would be as distinc- tive and as proper to its element as naval warfare was to the sea.

Firearms had enjoyed the same sort of status when they were first introduced. Inherent in this interpretation was the assumption that aerial bombardment would ultimately lose its intim- idating effect. Group Capt. John Slessor, aide to Trenchard, preferred to think that the bomber was successful as a weapon against morale because it alone could attack the most vulnerable element in the pop- ulation, masses of civilians who did not have the discipline and "stick- ing power" of the military. This was also the view of Douhet, who believed that the great cities contained "the most delicate and suscep- tible part of the enemy."15 Given the distinctive psychological impact of aerial bombing, the experts were led on to the still unanswered question, How would the civilian population react to serious and sustained attacks directed at its "morale"? Some foresaw that such attacks would trigger massive panics, and here and there in the bombing episodes of the war, there were indeed glimpses of what those panics might be like. A crowd stampeded into a London subway at the beginning of one raid, and a similar incident claimed sixty lives in the Paris metro. Others felt that the raids would generate deep anger. Douhet, who studied press reports of the 1917 attacks on London, concluded that the average Londoner was as furious with his own government for its inability to protect him as he was with the Germans for attacking him. The anger would ultimately find outlets-perhaps in rioting and looting, as had occurred in isolated instances. There seemed an ominous possibility that the masses, impelled by fury, terror, or a combination of those emotions, could turn against their own leaders. Frenzied mobs in the capital, seeking an end to the nightmare, might storm the centers of government. No less an author- ity than Marshal Foch told Groves that a massive air attack could have such "a crushing mora

The total number of dead will never be known; esti- mates have ranged between twenty-five thousand and a half million.  162 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING The German government was also party to the increasing ruthless- ness of the struggle in the air. It made its own contribution to terror- istic and indiscriminate warfare with the V-1 and V-2 weapons: aimed at a target the size of London, they might come down anywhere in southeastern England. What is more, Hitler and his entourage consid- ered measures against captured Allied armies that would have had profound repercussions had they continued. Starting with the raid on Lübeck, the German press had called the Allied bombing attacks Ter- rorangriffe with such regularity that the term passed into general usage. If the Allied airmen bombed to instill terror in the population, they were criminals and should be treated as such. This was the argu- ment put forward by Goebbels. When he learned in the spring of 1943 that the Japanese government was placing on trial American airmen who had bombed Tokyo the year before, Goebbels urged Hitler to do the same. The Führer refused, not because it was against his principles but because "he fears the English may have too many possibilities for reprisals."25 In 1944 there were several occasions on which Allied airmen who had bailed out over Germany were manhandled and even beaten to death by irate crowds of German civilians. Here was another propa- ganda opportunity for the Germans to exploit. On May 29, 1944. Goebbels wrote in the Völkische Beobachter, "It seems to us hardly possible and tolerable to use German police and soldiers against the German people when it treats murderers of children as they deserve." Both Heinrich Himmler and Martin Bormann let it be known that the police were not obliged to protect captured airmen from the popular wrath. These invitations to the German people to lynch downed flyers became more explicit in 1945, and i

Are they morally jus- tified? Or if they are militarily sound, are they justified ipso facto? Neither air power theorists nor air force generals have agreed on the answers to these questions, and the debates over them have been very much a part of the bomber's story. If strategic bombing has been a controversial subject, it can also become an extremely technical one. Here I have tried to avoid adding needless complexities to what is after all a broad-stroke history intended for general readers. Finally, I have made a choice every his- torian must make when writing a book of this nature: I have chosen ix  CHAPTER 1 x FOREWORD to place myself-and the reader-outside of the action, rather than in the middle of it. Some who read this book may regret that I did not take them through the darkened streets of London during the Blitz or send them over Germany inside a careening Lancaster bomber. But we can do more than simply know past events vicariously; we can understand them as well if we can see them and the men who partic- ipated in them in perspective, against the proper backdrop of time and place. In military history, then, the secret is to remain above the bat- tle, yet not so far above it that the participants become faceless pawns. I leave it to the reader to determine if I have succeeded. A WEAPON IS BORN ON NOVEMBER 21, 1783, man turned a page in his history. On that day a crowd gathered at the outskirts of Paris to watch a physician and an army officer climb into the gondola of a hot-air balloon and become the first men to fly. To be sure, there had been some preliminary experiments earlier that year with the newly devised balloon: animals had been sent aloft and had returned no worse for wear, and men had already made a modest ascent in a carefully tethered balloon. But this was man's first free flight, and it was at once epochal and uneventful. The balloon rose gently to a height of about three tho

(4) In the immediate neighbourhood of the operations of land forces, the bombardment of cities, towns, villages, dwellings, or build- ings is legitimate provided that there exists a reasonable presumption that the military concentration is sufficiently important to justify such bombardment, having regard to the danger thus caused to the civilian population. (5) A belligerent State is liable to pay compensation for injuries to person or to property caused by the violation by any of its officers or forces of the provisions of this article.8 Article 25 concerned the special identifying marks to be placed on hospitals, museums, and the like. Article 26 dealt with special "zones of protection" for historical monuments. (Both of these articles origi- nated with the Italian delegation.) The key provision is article 24, which Spaight immediately per- ceived would produce "difficulties." Spaight had served as air adviser to the British delegation at The Hague and dedicated his book Air Power and War Rights to the American jurist John Bassett Moore, who had chaired the Hague meeting, but in that same book he wrote: It is doubtful whether such rules for air bombardment as those drawn up by the jurists at the Hague in January-February, 1923, will save the world's great cities. The doctrine of the 'military objective,' useful within its own limits, will be no adequate protection. Any belligerent who chooses will be able to keep within the rules which embody that doctrine and yet use his air arms for a purpose quite distinct from the destruction of objects of military importance, namely, for the creation of a moral, political or psychological effect within the enemy country.' In a future war the bombers would be drawn inexorably to cities and industrial centers; as in the last war, they would find convenient "mil- itary"
