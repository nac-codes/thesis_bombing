German air defenses seemed if anything stronger at the beginning of 1944 than they had been twelve months before: some sixteen hundred fighters of all types guarded Germany and the western front, five hundred more than were available in early 1943. This was partly because the Ger- man fighters in the air were able to protect those still on the assembly  154 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BATTLE OF GERMANY lines, and whatever damage was done to the German aircraft industry was soon set aright.

Despite the Führer's order some night fighting of this sort continued, but it soon became the specialty of RAF Mosquitoes, whose "intruder" operations made them a menace around German air bases. The second major element in the German air-defense system was the Flakartillerie, with its batteries of guns and searchlights. In 1935 this service left the control of the German Army and became a part of the Luftwaffe, and it is quite probable that the transfer ultimately robbed the service of much of its potential. In order to head off a movement by the army to supply its own antiaircraft defenses in the field, Goering motorized a part of the Flakartillerie and sent it off to accompany the army of the blitzkrieg campaigns of 1939-41. These units, quickly grouped into two Flak Corps, won a good deal of praise for their participation in the land battles as well as for their success against enemy aircraft. But the elements that remained at home for air defense of the Reich had little chance to distinguish themselves in those first years of the war, when the RAF's attacks were no more than pinpricks. According to their historian, these units suffered from an "inferiority complex."14 Their morale was not improved by the scoldings they received from Goering when British bombers began to roam the night skies of Germany almost at will.

The day fighters of the Luftwaffe probably suffered irremediable losses in the air battles of 1944.

Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering had taken control of every aspect of Germany's air defense, and there seems little doubt that it was he who bore chief reponsibility for its ultimate failure. Although the night fighter was to prove the most deadly enemy of the RAF bomber, the Reichsmarschall had proclaimed at the beginning of the war, "Night fighting will never happen."12 The Luftwaffe's prewar experiments with night interceptions had been dropped, but after the war broke out, pilots in several units continued the effort on their own initiative, and in April 1940 a Messerschmitt 110 operating from a field in Denmark made a nighttime interception of a British bomber. Other pilots reported successful contacts, and in July a pilot of Jagd- geschwader II succeeded in bringing down an RAF Whitley. By then the Luftwaffe leadership had become interested again, for in June 1940 it created the first night-fighter unit, Nachtjagdgeschwader I. Gen. Josef Kammhuber took command of night-fighter activities and embarked on a number of tests of both dunkel Jagd, literally "hunting in the dark," and helle Jagd, in which the night fighter found its target with the aid of a searchlight. These experiments led to a defensive belt, the Kammhuber Line. Initially Kammhuber had most success with a helle Jagd system that employed radar, fighters, and searchlights working together, with  138 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ALLIED AIR OFFENSIVE a "team" of these covering a Raum, or "box" twenty-seven miles wide and twenty-one deep.

In 1915 the Germans had about 1,000 machines available on the entire front. Ritter concluded, "An air barrier is generally an impossible thing."7 The alternative to defending a broad front in the air was to meet individual attacks as they developed. Unfortunately, the speed of attacking aircraft and the inevitable delays in detecting them and get- ting intercepting planes aloft-the "lag time"-meant it was impos- sible to organize an air defense for Paris and very difficult to do so for London before enemy bombers were over their target. Spaight laid down a general rule that air power could not be prevented by air power from penetrating an enemy's defense. Gen. Bernard Serrigny reasoned that a nation's vulnerability was essentially a "function of its distance from an enemy's bases of departure."8 This did not mean that the bombing plane always had the advan- tage over air defenses. Only in the first few months of the war-what the French called "the golden age of bombing"-could those planes go about their work without fear of serious hindrance. Soon fighter craft developed and made the bomber their prey. By September 1915, losses in French bombing units were approaching a crisis level; by 1917 the Germans abandoned long-distance day bombardment com- pletely. There were several ways to meet the threat posed by the fighter: one was to increase the bomber's capacity to defend itself; another was formation flying, which allowed planes to put up a collec- tive defense; and a third was to have the bombers escorted by fighting craft of one's own. But the most effective response for planes with long-distance missions was simply to carry out those missions at night.

The more optimistic at Eighth Air Force headquarters felt that once they were available in sufficient numbers, Fortresses and Liberators would be able to venture deep into Germany unescorted and return with losses of under 5 percent. General Eaker was confident that his planes could put 40 percent of their bombs within five hundred yards of the aiming point. His colleagues in the RAF were polite but dubious. British bombers still made occasional daytime forays into Germany and invariably showed that the game was not worth the candle. (A day- light raid on a diesel engine factory at Augsburg on April 17, 1942 cost Bomber Command seven of the twelve attacking Lancasters.) The leaders of the RAF were not impressed with the argument that what the American bombers sacrificed in bomb-carrying capacity, 137 they gained in ability to defend themselves; the British had given the early models of the Fortress and the Liberator limited trials and were not greatly impressed by either aircraft. The year 1943 would see the Americans' concept of strategic bombing put to the test and some of the misgivings of their British allies confirmed. The coming battles would work a significant change on the Luft- waffe. Whereas previously the Luftwaffe had been a weapon forged for offensive use, now it had to be set to the task of defending the Reich. Curiously, the initiative often came from below, for the highest leadership in Nazi Germany was slow to admit that defensive mea- sures were needed or even that the Reich was vulnerable to air assaults. Once the air offensive began in earnest, Germany's leaders, especially Hitler, could think of no way to combat it save massive reprisal.

But nearly two months elapsed between the fall of France and "Eagle Day"- August 13-the date on which Goering formally opened the air offen- sive against Great Britain. The delay was due in part to difficulties in working out strategy for the offensive. A sure and steady hand had guided the German air force through the Battle of France, but once the panzers reached the Channel the assurance disappeared. Faced with an island fortress that spurned the Führer's "appeal to reason" on July 19, Germany's leaders were not sure quite how to grasp the nettle. This is not to say that the Germans lost what has come to be called the Battle of Britain simply because they failed to adhere to a master plan while the British did. In the combat conditions prevailing over much of the British Isles, the advantage swung to the defensive for several reasons, chiefly technical ones.

Luftwaffe pilots were also unaccustomed to navigation over bodies of water. When they began to cross the North Sea and probe the British coastline in 1938, they sometimes missed their intended landfall by fifty miles. Sometimes these errors led to embarrassment, as when a flight of Italian bombers sent to aid Spain's Gen. Francisco Franco ended up in French North Africa. The men who led the air forces of Europe could certainly have done more to prepare those forces for the demands of war; but, in fairness to them, it must be said that they could only go so far in anticipating what the next war would be like. By 1938 the lessons of the Great War were twenty years old and of doubtful validity in many cases. Would the rules of combat at twenty-five thousand feet be the same as they had been at ten thousand? What effect would the higher speed of aircraft have on air battles? The French decided that fighter engagements would become so complex that a squadron commander in a special "command" plane would have to supervise the battle from a distance, directing the movements of his fighters by radio. Bombing squadrons also were eager to know what air combat would be like. Would the bombers' all-metal construction make them less vulnerable to fighter attacks, or would the generation of new fight- ers carrying eight machine guns or 20mm cannon take heavy toll? Each bomber design of 1939 represented a series of compromises, of critical decisions by designers obliged to choose between conflicting theories. There were many schools of thought on what the bomber should be, none of them confirmed by the test of war. Some argued the advantages of the multipurpose aircraft.

The work was sus- pended on orders from above; the Flakartillerie did not get permission to pursue the project again until 1944, too late for the gun to see service. The most critical problem German ground defenses faced in the first years of the war was achieving accurate fire at night. The Kom- mandogerät, or "predictor," used by the heavy batteries relied chiefly on visual contact with the target, therefore on the ability of the search- lights to find and hold an enemy aircraft at night-not always an easy task. The ideal solution was to link the fire-control system to a radar set, a scheme the Telefunken Company was working on in 1939. But the first available radar sets, the Würzburgs, were routed to other uses, on the grounds that they were not sufficiently accurate for gun- laying. Yet, when improved radar more suitable to this purpose appeared, it too was allocated to competing services. Ultimately, the heavy flak batteries got updated Würzburg radar equipment, but even this was slow in coming. By the end of 1941, a great many heavy-flak batteries lacked any kind of electronic fire-control system for night work. By the beginning of 1943, German flak units were in a considerably better state, and so for that matter was the whole air-defense system, all of which was under the command of a Luftwaffe general carrying the title Luftwaffebefehlshaber Mitte. The flak units would help defend the cities both day and night. The Kammhuber Line offered a formidable obstacle to the night intrusions of the RAF. Finally, there was the threat of heavy daylight raids from the Americans, although at the end of 1942, this danger was no more than a cloud on the hori- zon.

But Hitler refused: Ger- many was not going to initiate the air war. It was the RAF that did that on September 4 with surprise raids on German naval units at Wilhelmshaven and Brunnsbüttel. The Luftwaffe replied with a raid on elements of the British fleet off Great Fisher Bank on September 26, and another on October 16 into the Firth of Forth, where H.M.S Hood was reported at anchor. The Hood was there, but docked, or nearly so. The pilots of the Junkers 88s passed it up for fear they might put a bomb on the shore; they bombed smaller vessels, with indifferent results. By December 19 the Royal Navy could report fifteen separate air attacks on its ships. The Luftwaffe had damaged a cruiser and a destroyer, neither of them seriously. The RAF did not do much better. By the spring of 1940, it had made 861 sorties against enemy war- 1 ships, causing slight damage to the Emden and the Scheer. The cost was high-forty-one bombers lost. It was in these raids that Bomber Command began to realize just how vulnerable its bombers were to German air defenses. In forays across the North Sea on December 14 and again on December 18, small formations of Wellington bombers ran into intense fighter opposition. (German radar, which was just becoming operational along the North Sea coast, gave advance warn- ing of their approach.) Underarmed and without self-sealing gas tanks, the Wellingtons suffered 50 percent losses on each raid.

The Luftwaffe began trials with night fighters in 1936, and at about the same time, the French intensified their own researches. The French Air Force had two specialized night-fighter units at the beginning of the war, but these had little success. If all these handicaps and shortcomings in air defense are combined and then compared with the capabilities of the Schnellbomber, it is easy to see how the British Air Staff could advise the government that a German air offensive against England might produce sixty thousand casualties in the first week and that little or nothing could be done to prevent this. The British government was particularly alarmed by the threat from the air, but no government could be indifferent to it. In each country, the authorities had to decide how much they could tell their populations and how they could prepare them for the dangers ahead. Ordinary citizens had certainly not been kept in ignorance of the bomber and what it could do.

In the narrow sense, the Battle of Britain was a duel of sorts, a direct confrontation between two air forces. The Luftwaffe's chief goal was to shatter Fighter Command, to kill or exhaust its pilots, and to destroy its Spitfires and Hurricanes not only in the air but on the ground and even on the assembly lines. The British had to make this effort prohibitively expensive for the Ger- mans, and ultimately this is what they succeeded in doing. A battle of this sort could be fought only in daylight hours; it filled the long sum- mer days of August and September 1940 and culminated in the vast air battles on Sunday, September 15, which cost the Luftwaffe sixty aircraft and Fighter Command twenty-six. Thereafter, Goering was forced to take a long, sobering look at his bombing offensive; by the end of September it had cost the Germans over fifteen hundred air- craft and crews, with little evidence that Britain's air defenses had been seriously impaired. With September the great daylight raids came to an end. Henceforth, the German bombers would strike under cover of night. The abandonment of massive daylight raids meant also the end of precision bombing and consequently of the attacks on smaller targets. Initially the Luftwaffe set great store by two systems of radio guidance (the X-Geraet and Knickebein) in which the bombing planes would fly "on the beam" straight over the objective, releasing their bombs at the right moment in accordance with a signal. Elite crews were trained in the technique to form Kampfgruppe 100, whose purpose was to mark the target for the main bombing force that followed. But the British got wind of the system early in the summer and managed to interfere with its operation-the beginning of a "high-frequency war" involving increasingly sophisticated "black boxes" and elaborate jamming tech- niques.

That same summer the Luftwaffe high command ordered the withdrawal of fighter units from the various fronts and occupied coun- tries-two Jagdgeschwader from the eastern front, one from France and parts of several Geschwader from Italy. The units were rapidly integrated into the air defense system. Flak units also multiplied in 1943 and now used radar both for gunlaying and for directing searchlights. There were not enough heavy flak guns for the units now being created, so they used captured weap- ons, including sizable numbers of Russian and Czech models. Begin- ning in 1943, the flak units began to draw on the Reich Labor Service for personnel; over a hundred thousand women worked in the antiair craft batteries, where they were joined by Hitler Youth, Croatian and Italian laborers, and Russian prisoners of war. Goering joked that his flak units were like the League of Nations, while Goebbels worried about "miscegenation" in the batteries. The German civil-defense system had already been shaken out of its complacency in 1942, following the raids on Lübeck, Rostock, and Cologne. (The German press gave considerable coverage to the raid as Terrorangriffe, or "terror attacks," but carefully avoided indicating the loss of life or the extent of the destruction.) The distinct danger that fire seemed to present was now recognized, and there was a shake-up in the Amtsgruppe Feuerwehr, the office in the German Air Ministry concerned with fire fighting. Hans Rumpf took the post of Generalinspekteur des Feuerlöschwesens and began the task of strengthening and unifying the fire-fighting forces in the towns and cities of Germany. The year 1943 saw substantial progress in the con- struction of air-raid shelters, an activity that had lagged in a number of cities. The new cycle of raids was an obvious incentive, but if the inhabitants of Germany's cities needed any further reminder, it w

In the aftermath of the Lübeck raid, he was chiefly anxious about historic towns such as Wei- mar and Nuremberg. "Factories can be rebuilt," he told his entou- rage, "but works of art are irreplaceable."13 He spoke of giving every German village its own battery and searchlight detachment; blinded by a continuous sea of lights, the British pilots would not be able to see anything. Besides being ambitious in the extreme, Hitler's incli- nation to defend everything would thwart the development of Kammhuber's plans. The cities of the Reich were not to be denied; Berlin saw its complement of antiaircraft batteries doubled after the 139 RAF raids in the late summer and fall of 1940; by early 1941 it had its own line of boxes defending its western approaches. The gauleiters clamored for more protection for other towns, often with success. Hitler also intervened to put an end to a promising development in night-fighter tactics pioneered by the pilots of Nachtjagdgeschwader II. The aircraft used for night interceptor work were two-engined craft such as the Messerschmitt 110 and the Junkers 88, chosen initially because their greater endurance allowed more time to stalk an enemy than would be the case with the single-engined Messerschmitt 109. The considerable range of the Junkers 88 and the Dornier 17, which was also used for night operations, led some pilots to undertake what was called Fernnachtjagd-attacking the enemy bombers where they were most vulnerable, over England. It was an easy matter to locate the enemy bombers by their radio traffic as they formed for the out- bound flight or to follow them back and attack as they glided toward the haven of their home bases. In October 1941, Hitler ordered an end to Fernnachtjagd sorties. The kills made over England could not be verified; the planes that defended the Reich should do so in their own airspace, where their efforts could be seen and appreciat

At night their fire could be directed only by means of searchlights and sound-detection equip- ment, and neither of these devices worked very well at locating the high-flying and fast-moving bombers of the Luftwaffe. The only other technique was barrage fire, in which the batteries tried to put into the sky a curtain of projectiles into which, it was hoped, the enemy planes would fly. The solution to better accuracy lay in the use of radar to aim the guns, but promising as the idea was, it had not been realized in 1940. The night fighter, the other potential weapon against the nocturnal bomber, was in a very early stage of development in 1940, for in this instance the British had lagged behind both the Germans and the French. The hastily constituted night-fighter units of 1940 rarely found their targets, and although there were certainly prospects of improvement with airborne radar, actual improvements did not come until later. The incessant pounding of the antiaircraft guns was com- forting to Londoners, and both guns and night fighters added some- thing to the stress that German aircrews had to face, thus perhaps contributing to accidents, which in this period seem to have accounted for more German bomber losses than any other cause. But this was little recompense for the vast defensive efforts both on the ground and in the air. Gen. Sir Frederick Pile, who helped organize the air defenses of the London area, confessed, "We seemed as far as ever from solving the great problem of the night bomber."12 Largely undeterred, then, Luftflotten II and III continued their campaign against the British capital. Through September and Octo- ber the attacks went on, with a nightly average of 160 raiders. For the month of October the Luftwaffe released on the city 7,160 tons of high explosives and 4,735 canisters of incendiaries. In November came a shift of emphasis, with more attacks directed at other British cities. Cov

And when that theory proved false, so did the concept of day bombardment. While brief penetra- tions into enemy airspace by daylight might still be possible with fighter escort, any deep, massive thrust could be carried out only under cover of darkness. This lesson had been learned at considerable cost, 125  126 A HISTORY OF STRATEGIC BOMBING THE BEGINNINGS OF THE ALLIED AIR OFFENSIVE 127 and Bomber Command took it to heart: in the last four months of 1940, its planes made twenty nighttime sorties for each one flown by day. And two years later, when the American Eighth Air Force was preparing to send its Fortresses and Liberators into the daytime skies of Germany, the pessimism in Bomber Command was ill concealed. The conversion to night operations put severe limitations on bomb- ing. While the fighters and flak batteries of the Luftwaffe were much less of a problem, nature posed some formidable obstacles. First of all. the raid could not stretch much past the hours of darkness, or else the bombers could be intercepted on the way to the target as well as returning from it. In practical terms, this meant that in summer, with its shorter nights, a bombing force could not fly to Berlin, Leipzig, or Stettin and back. These cities thus became "winter" targets, at least for the time being. Darkness imposed still another restriction on bombing. During only a fourth of the nights each month would the moon be in correct phase-the "bomber's moon"-for sighting and identifying most objectives. (There were some exceptions, such as blast furnaces and targets that could be fixed by their relationship to bodies of water. these often being visible on darker nights.) Any cloudiness would com- plicate the bombardier's task even further. The towns in the Ruhr were notable for being partly shielded by the industrial haze that hung over the region. The search was on for better navigation aids and "blind bombing" devices, but for
