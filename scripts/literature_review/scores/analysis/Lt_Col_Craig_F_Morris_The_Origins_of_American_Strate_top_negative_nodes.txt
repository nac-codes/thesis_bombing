With this return to an internally focused political policy, there was no longer a need to maintain the large and extremely costly wartime military.   Military demobilization followed swiftly behind the political changes with lower budgets, less equipment, and manpower shortages defining the future.  The massive reductions hit the Air Service hard.  Of the twenty thousand officers on duty at the end of the war, only a little more than two hundred regular officers remained in the Air Service at the start of 1920.  To make matters worse, these were all officers “on detail” from other branches as the Air Service was still not a formally recognized corps within the Army, but just a subdivision of the Signal Corps.287 Besides the understandable problems with the loss of budgets and manpower resources, the Air Service faced other less obvious effects.  A good example occurred in personnel policies.  With demobilization came the return of prewar permanent ranks for many Air Service leaders.  Here again, the 1909 personnel policy of only allowing junior officers to become pilots disrupted the service.  Whereas, most senior infantry or artillery officers returned to postwar duties at similar ranks to their wartime ratings, Air Service officers often saw a jaw-dropping demotion.

The operational manual was akin to the bible for most Army branches and field services.  It imparted the leadership-approved methodologies for solving various military problems.  In an era before formal doctrine documents, these manuals served a similar purpose.  They were literally the book in the old saying, “I want it done by the book.”  Considering this history, it is not unusual that Billy Mitchell, the American Air Service’s most famous airman, utilized this methodology to capture his vision of air power for future generations.  On 15 November 1918, Mitchell assumed command of the Air Services for the U.S. Third Army, which was the American contribution to the occupation forces monitoring German compliance with the Treaty of Versailles.240  This command represented a unique opportunity for Mitchell.  After the hectic pace of leading large air offensives, he had time to focus on non-combat-related activities.  Mitchell immediately had his staff begin working on an operational Air Service manual for the Third Army based on his experience during the war.  Mitchell’s staff completed the Provisional Manual of Operations of Air Service Units on 23 December 1918.241  In what today would be called a standard operating procedure, Mitchell documented the daily processes used by aviation units under his command during the battles of St. Mihiel and the Meuse Argonne.  While the manual covered all aspects of aviation, two sections are important from a bombing perspective.                                                 240 James J.

This attitude seems to have penetrated into the psyche of the Air Service across all components in the Army.  Only one month after returning to command of the Air Service in 1921, Mason Patrick received a letter of congratulations from an old friend, Gen. Francis J. Kernan, then Chief of the Philippine Department.  In his letter, Kernan expressed his concern over the state of the Air Service personnel, which he described as troublesome.299  Patrick’s response letter perhaps even better depicts the disciplinary situation of the Air Service as it entered the 1920s.  He wrote Kernan, “it is the youth and inexperience of its officers whom it is necessary to place in responsible positions that are largely the cause of the trouble.  I mean to impress upon them as firmly as may be necessary the fact that their duty must be performed properly, that the constituted authorities must exercise efficient supervision over them, and that they must learn the essentials of discipline.”300  This correspondence between Patrick and Kernan reflected another aspect of the ramifications of the 1909 personnel policy limiting military aviation entry to junior                                                 298 J.

Perhaps it is best to think of Tiverton as a source of inspiration for the overworked young staff officer.  As many historians have noted, Gorrell copied large parts of Tiverton’s memorandum.  Yet, this does not necessarily mean he simply stole his ideas.  In the time-honored world of military staff work, copying others’ writing that makes one’s argument is simply good time management.  Lifted statements like “unquestionably, the greatest morale effect is by day, compared to night attacks when German workers are in their own houses” cannot be considered solely a British idea.  All air services held similar beliefs.  Thus, there is definitely an amalgamation of Tiverton’s work into Gorrell’s, but to claim it is the sole source seems a stretch. At the same time, the British were not the only source of international inspiration for Gorrell.  From his first visit to Italy with the Bolling Commission, Gorrell maintained a close relationship with Count Giovanni Battista Caproni, an aircraft designer and close friend of the Italian bombing theorist Giulio Douhet.153  During his initial trip to Italy in June 1917, Gorrell formed a relationship with Caproni.  This rapport, like that with Tiverton, took on a senior-mentor flavor.  Both men shared an interest in bombing, which they discussed on numerous occasions when Gorrell was in Italy.  Caproni’s journal mentions several conversations over dinner where he and Gorrell discussed air warfare and the role of bombing in destroying an enemy’s capability to fight.154 It appears Caproni captured Go

Gorrell also spent a tremendous effort in capturing as much of the historical lessons and critiques of the Air Service’s experience in World War I as possible in his postwar official history.  Finally, Gorrell’s experience and capabilities led to his selection to work for President Woodrow Wilson during the Paris Peace Conference. Wilson arrived in Europe on 13 December 1918 to prepare for the peace negotiations.  Once he arrived in Paris, the president gathered a team of advisors to help prepare the American positions on the many different aspects of the proposed treaty.  One of these elements concerned the future of international aviation and flying in Germany,  to be addressed by a subcommission titled the Aeronautical Commission of the Peace Conference.  When Wilson inquired about a qualified young officer to advise him on the subcommission’s activities, General Patrick proffered Gorrell.  Thus, Wilson likely started Gorrell along his future path as an expert in civil aviation when he selected him as his advisor on international aviation concerns during the Paris Peace Conference.276   The Aeronautical Commission did not start its formal work until March 1919 when it set about creating a set of rules for international aviation.  The commission worked through a series of conventions where representatives from twenty-seven nations gathered to reach agreements.  Their work concluded with the Convention Relating to the Regulation of Aerial Navigation on 13 October 1919.  In the treaty, all twenty-seven nations agreed to adhere to international flight standards and methodologies to coordinate aviation issues that crossed international borders.277  This commission eventually came                                                 276 Edgar S.

He stated, “This is not a phantom nor a dream, but is a huge reality capable of being carried out with success if the U.S. will only carry on a sufficiently large campaign for next year, and manufacture the types of airplanes, that lend themselves to this campaign, instead of building pursuit planes already out of date.”155   As the memorandum suggests, Gorrell’s friendship with Caproni did not end with the conclusion of the Bolling Commission.  They continued to correspond through the end of 1917.  Sometime before 31 October, Caproni gave Gorrell the book Let Us Kill the War; Let Us Aim at the Heart of the Enemy.156  This book, reprinted in English, described how strategic bombing could destroy an enemy’s industry and civilian morale.  On 31 October, Gorrell wrote to Caproni thanking him for the book.  He again wrote on 17 November asking for more copies to share with his fellow aviators.  In this same letter, Gorrell also called on Caproni to recommend targets inside Germany for an American strategic bombardment campaign.157    Tiverton’s and Caproni’s influences on internal American debates are visible in Gorrell’s first two formal reports from Europe.  The Bolling Report on 15 August 1917 specifically highlighted the need to buy long-range bombardment aircraft to sustain a strategic effort.  Meanwhile, Go

The external changes were critical in shaping the overall atmosphere that the Army and its Air Service had to operate in during the early 1920s.  Political change brought about new economic and social dynamics that defined the context in which air power evolved.  These contextual factors played a major part in reshaping the tactics, policies, and goals of air power advocates, which in turn formed the Air Service’s structural and doctrinal foundations. The most important of these political shifts occurred in the immediate aftermath of World War I.  The mid-term congressional elections of 1918 brought to power the opposition Republican Party in the House of Representatives.  A mere week before the Armistice, the election setback portended more political troubles for President Wilson.  Whereas Wilson had tried to use the election as a referendum on his plans for the postwar world, the Republicans countered with criticism that his policies made America too much a player in the international system.  His Fourteen Points plan for the peace and restructuring of Europe, depending on the United States to play a major role in the newly created League of Nations, only seemed to confirm the Republican charges.

Instead of becoming a major participant in the international system, the United States returned to its more traditionally isolationist posture.

His earlier correspondence with Tiverton and Caproni indicated he knew of both men’s views that morale effects might be greater than physical destruction, but he had not addressed them in writing until this point.  Gorrell used two examples to support his argument that even if bombers missed their targets, they would still produce enough discontent and alarm to disrupt production.  He cited British statistics of factory man-hour losses due to evacuations during the Gotha raids and French reports on their labor difficulties after German raids near Pont-St Vincent.  Concerning the French raids, Gorrell wrote that “though they have never interrupted the work for more than a few hours, it has become increasingly difficult to persuade the workmen to remain.”194   Consequently, Gorrell modified his earlier core components of strategic bombing.  Target selection and concentration remained his chief focus, but he toned down                                                 192 Ibid., 4. 193 Ibid., 10. 194 Ibid., 15.

Additionally, he added a psychological element by arguing that the morale effects of bombardment were as important as physical destruction.  While Gorrell cannot claim to have created any of these concepts, he does deserve credit for linking them in a formal policy proposal for a uniquely American vision of air power.   Despite Gorrell’s effort to meet American concerns, his second bombing proposal fell on deaf ears.  This likely occurred for three reasons.  First, Gorrell’s earlier memorandum caused too much bad blood with senior AEF staff officers.  With their feathers already ruffled, they were likely predisposed to look unfavorably on any new strategic bombing proposal even with Gorrell’s new terminology limiting independence or war-winning capabilities.  Next, by early 1918 aircraft production shortages were readily observable to the AEF staff.  Gorrell’s

Despite being largely hidden in the later portion of Gorrell’s official history, the bombing survey contained a wealth of information and assessments for future visionaries.  As Gorrell’s history remained on the shelves in many important U.S. Army Air Service, and later Air Corps, libraries throughout the 1930s, the survey proved accessible, though sometimes hidden.  When combined with Gorrell’s history of the Paris office and the Strategical Section the three documents provided a vision for strategic bombing to help stimulate the thoughts of young theorists and the statistical evidence to apply strategic bombing in the next great war.      Turning a Corner Gorrell’s influence on aviation did not stop with his history.  Even before he departed from Europe, Gorrell started to expand his aviation resume.  His successful war record, degree in aeronautical engineering, and reputation for superior administrative capabilities drew Gorrell into important roles shaping aviation’s future.  At the same time, he frequently showed dissatisfaction with working within the stiff confines of a bureaucracy that often did not agree with his positions.  Eventually, this led him to abandon the Air Service for new adventures, but it never removed his love for aviation.  Nevertheless, in 1919, Gorrell was fully committed to shaping the future of the Air Service.  This took many forms.

Patrick’s vision went beyond just compiling the unit histories, as he expanded the task to include written inputs from every responsible unit commander and aviator.  Patrick even stressed the importance of the project by giving guidance that no officer would be released to return to the United States until Gorrell accepted his lessons learned and historical records submissions.252  In the end, Gorrell’s efforts culminated in the officially titled Final Report to the Chief of the Air Service, AEF, which over time became better known as the Gorrell History due to his central role in creating the multivolume document.

Before leaving the United States, his membership on the Joint Army-Navy Technical Board and Benjamin Foulois’s staff gave him a solid foundation in debates about the force size and structure.

Additionally, his role on the Bolling Commission and later as Chief Engineer of AEF Air Services provided him with plenty of opportunities to discuss strategy with key staff members and to read the findings of the many different strategy boards.

The British Commission was only a few blocks from the offices of the Bolling Commission in a requisitioned apartment house near the Arc de Triomphe.147  In both his time as Chief Engineer of the AEF Air Service and as an operational strategist, Gorrell often sought Tiverton’s advice.  This informal coordination blossomed into a friendship between the two aviators during the fall of 1917 and Tiverton became a leading confidant and advisor to Gorrell on strategic bombing.                                                 147 Williams, “Shank of the Drill,” 384.

His life followed a typical British upper-class trajectory including attending Eton and Oxford before becoming a barrister in 1906.  This traditional life changed rapidly when Britain declared war on Germany in 1914.  Tiverton left his law practice and entered the Royal Naval Air Service.

Finally, even military reports often supported a morale cost to bombing.  One report cited in this section demonstrated that the German military closed its troop rest facility at Bouley because the frequent bombings kept soldiers from getting enough sleep.271  Based on these factors, the report ended with a final estimate of the cost of bombing to the German economy.  While it included the 641 killed and 1,263 wounded in bombing attacks, the survey stressed that the real results of bombing were economic.  The study estimated bombing cost the German war effort 204 million marks.  This included an estimated 133 million in direct cost from physical damage and loss of production and another 71 million in indirect cost from civil defenses, morale loss, and air defense.272  To put that in today’s U.S. GDP dollar value, it equaled approximately $15 billion in economic damage.  At the same time, the survey was quick to point out that this cost was only based on 66 out of 140 cities targeted in the study area where they could find verifiable data.273  This suggested that if the trends found in these 66 cities held true for the others bombed by French, English, and American aircraft, the real cost of bombing could have been three to four times higher.   Because this tantalizing possibility must have seemed far-fetched to many Army leaders., the report’s authors were ready to preempt any criticism based solely on                                                 271 Ibid., 4-5. 272 Ibid., 6. 273 While the report included data on 80 cities, only 66 were deemed verifiable enough to include in damage calculations.

His statements like “they would be used to carry the war well into the enemy’s country” could be interpreted to mean interdicting the flow of supplies and reinforcements well behind the front lines.  Additionally, this application of air power was more consistent with Mitchell’s appreciation of the British model he garnered during his meetings with the RFC Commander, Sir Hugh Trenchard.  By the summer of 1917, Trenchard viewed air power’s primary role as supporting Army offensive operations by constantly attacking                                                 138 Ibid., 82. 139 Ibid., 81.

Thus, it is most likely that Mitchell’s memorandum actually advocated a two-fold mission for air power.  On one level it described a tactical force conducting observation and artillery spotting missions in direct support of ground commander.  Meanwhile, on a different level Mitchell advocated for a semi-independent strategical element that would attack the enemy’s war materials behind the front lines.  It is quite likely that a misunderstanding of Mitchell’s use of strategical aviation in this memorandum explains many historians’ belief that Mitchell advocated the modern understanding of strategic bombing early in World War I.   Still, Mitchell’s radical proposal caused concern in the AEF staff.  Even if he was not advocating for strategic bombing as a war-winning tool, he seemed to support an independent role for the AEF Air Service that many senior ground commanders deemed threatening.  It is likely that Mitchell’s memorandum was fresh in the AEF Chief of Staff’s mind, when less than a week later, on 19 June, Major General Harbord convened a Board of Officers to make recommendati

Still, the survey pointed out that even if the numbers were overestimated, these results occurred without a dedicated campaign specifically targeting critical military-related industries.  Thus, the survey invited future readers to speculate on what might have been accomplished if the Air Service had focused on strategic bombing and not on ground support. After the monetary discussion, the report continued with a section on recommendations for future bombing operations.  It started by acknowledging the primacy of air power in supporting ground forces, but then quickly hinted that a new role for air forces was needed.  An example of this occurred on page eight where the survey stated there could be no separate or independent bombing force, but then quickly went on to attack this deeply held Army belief in a discussion of target selection.  It recommended reversing the long-standing priority of first enemy troops, next railroad facilities, and only then industrial targets.  The survey explained there was more value in targeting industry than troop concentrations or transportation systems, as destroying the ability make weapons was more valuable than disrupting their arrival or usage at the front.   Therefore, they should be the first priority for future air forces.274  The final summary went even further to spell out specific recommendations that previewed the future theoretical debates of the 1930s.  On targeting, the report once again diverged from the British with regards to urban bombing.  The Americans refuted the British use of city bombing to break the enemy’s morale, explaining that “bombing for morale effects alone such as took place over Cologne, Frankfurt, Bonn, and Wiesbaden is not a productive means of bombing.  The effect is legitimate and just as considerable                                                 274 Ibid., 8.

File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 196 --- 190 Historian Tami Davis Biddle rightly points out that this environment led to a dichotomy in Air Service actions.  Externally, senior aviation officers had to appear to tow the “company line” on subjugation to the Army, while internally they developed and nurtured a more congenial independent ideology.306  The problem for these aviation leaders was how to maintain the appearance of following the rules while still achieving their goal of independence.   In the next few years, three distinct approaches among the Air Service leadership emerged to advocate for independence through their own particular vision of air power and how it related to national security.  These groups roughly break down into a group that favored rebellion, a group seeking independence by working within the system, and a third group that utilized a methodology drawing on parts from the other two.  Each of these factions shared a vision for an independent Air Service, but differed on two important aspects: the methodology to achieve it and the rationality for why independence was needed.  Contained within these differences were the seeds that grew into the air power strategy of the new Army Air Service. The first group were those favoring a rebellious strategy led by Billy Mitchell.  In January 1919, Mitchell returned from Europe as a man with a mission.  He was dead set on creating a new independent air force, likely with

They feared the British would inflict carnage on German cities in the name of revenge or destroying morale.  Concern appeared at the highest levels of the U.S. government.  In October 1918, Secretary of War Newton Baker sent word to General Pershing that the U.S. would not participate in any bombing plan that had as its objective “promiscuous bombing upon industry, commerce, or population.”226   In many ways these two issues forecast later debates on strategic bombing strategy.  Yet, in the end, World War I was over before any substantive actions could be taken to ameliorate the differences between the British and Americans.

These questions were all left open to interpretation by the end of fighting on 11 November 1918.    Technological Shortcomings and Conflicting Leadership   Perhaps a more useful question at this stage is why did the Americans fail to accept strategic bombing on the same level as their British allies?  While some of the reasons have been discussed in the preceding text, two other important areas deserve further study.  In their own particular way both technology and leadership also doomed any American strategic bombing campaign. Technological limitations proved a constant thorn in the side of American strategic bombing advocates.  The key problem was the inability of America’s aviation industry to produce large numbers of aircraft.  From t
