By the autumn of 1916, the situation started to change.  With the High Seas Fleet unable to break the British blockade and the German Army locked in a battle of attrition, the zeppelin seemed to offer a potential means for the Germans to break the stalemate.  Strasser seized on the moment when he wrote to Commander of the High Seas Fleet Adm. Reinhard Scheer on 10 August 1916 that, “the performance of the big airships has reinforced my conviction that England can be over come by means of airships.”102  With Scheer’s full approval, Strasser set out on one last big effort to break the British economy and will.                                                   101 Robinson, Zeppelin in Combat, 128-29. 102 Ibid., 165.

Better tracking, more capable interceptors, and new incendiary bullets drew a heavy toll on the attackers.  Of the 187 zeppelins launched against England that year, only 111 reached their targets.  Meanwhile, during the height of Strasser’s all-out offensive six costly zeppelins had been lost in combat.103   More important than the losses was the successful testing of the new Gotha bomber in the autumn of 1916.  These new twin-engine long-range bombers offered a means to strike England without the cost or dangers of vulnerable slow-flying zeppelins.  The German Army decided to invest its future in this new technology and officially cancelled its zeppelin program in January 1917. With this change in thinking, the commander of the German Air Service, General Ernst von Hoeppner proposed to create a thirty-aircraft bombing squadron of Gotha bombers for a strategic campaign against Britain.

Cheney summed up this line of thinking in a 5 September 1941 letter that ascribed the Luftwaffe’s failure to German errors and not because of inherent problems with strategic bombing theory.449 In this way, the American airmen were able to pick and choose the situation that best suited their own needs without challenging their base assumptions.  This helped in the near term to build a stronger air force and an initial strategic plan.  Yet, in the long run the approach led to the failure to identify important flaws in their own theory.  For instance, correctly understanding the role of the British integrated air defense in stopping the Luftwaffe might have shed light on American problems such as the lack of a long-range escort fighter to aid the bombers in penetrating a similar German air defense structure.

The statistics demonstrate the dire state of bomber production Gorrell faced.  The first American-built DH-4 daylight bomber was not shipped from Hoboken, New Jersey until March 1918.

Even if not used in a strategic role, the B-17 offered capabilities that Army leadership had to recognize as beneficial. Of course, the General Staff did not just roll over and surrender.  They countered with their own arguments of why the B-17 was the wrong aircraft at the wrong time.  First, they maintained the focus on the cost, constantly citing the $280,000 cost per B-17 as compared to only about $120,000 per B-18.430  The General Staff argued the cost of this one weapon system would preclude Craig from reconstituting the ground forces, thus creating a lopsided Army, which it knew would cut deep into Craig’s balanced restructuring vision. Next, the General Staff looked for a counter-argument to the success of the B-17 in maneuvers.

The Army General Staff countered with three arguments of its own.  First, the B-18 cost about half that of a B-17; hence, they could buy twice as many with the same amount of funds.  Next, the medium bomber would keep the Air Corps focused on its proper role: ground support.  Finally, the heavy bomber was too offensive and ran counter to America’s stated defensive national security policy.412 Luckily, the Air Corps received an unexpected ally in Army Chief of Staff Gen.

By this time, he had already lost two of his eight aircraft in crashes.  Therefore, Foulois requested ten new aircraft--two each from the Martin, Curtiss, Sturtevant, Thomas, and Sloane companies.36  Unfortunately, the Signal Corps lacked a system rapidly to buy and deploy airplanes and Foulois had to sustain operations as best he could.

The 1st Aero Squadron’s problems went beyond aircraft.  A poor doctrinal understanding of how to use aviation also hampered the squadron’s success.  Initially, Pershing saw two roles for his aviation squadron: reconnaissance and communications.  Not only could the aircraft search for Villa’s forces, but they could also find independently operating U.S. columns and deliver orders from the commander.  This seemed like a reasonable approach not only to Pershing, but also to Foulois, who voiced support for the plan.  Yet, as the squadron’s JN-3 aircraft demonstrated difficulty with reconnaissance missions in the Sierra Madres, they were increasingly relegated to courier duty.  During the heart of the expedition from 26 March and 4 April, the squadron flew seventy-nine missions carrying mail and dispatches along Pershing’s line of advance, but only two reconnaissance missions.38  The unbalanced nature of operations drew the ire of many of the pilots.  Not only were they risking their lives flying incapable JN-3 aircraft, but also the vast majority of their missions were delivering mail.

This included the formation of fifteen elite fighter squadrons.87    Verdun became a killing ground for French pilots just as it was for the common Poilu.

This does not mean strategic bombing stopped completely.  GB 1 and GB 2 continued raids on German economic targets in early 1916, striking the railroad station at Metz, ironworks in Lorraine, and munitions factories in the Saar region.  Yet, as Verdun consumed more resources and then the Somme offensive started, the French strategic bomber units found themselves increasingly pulled out for tactical support.

Still, as George Williams points out, this American position may have been a combination of theory and real-world practicality.171  From his time as the Chief of the Air Service’s Technical Section Gorrell must have understood the realities of bomber aircraft production and delivery timelines.  The primary planned daylight bomber, the DH-4, was already in production in Britain with allotments for delivery to the AEF Air Service scheduled, meanwhile the Handley Page night bomber required the delivery of Liberty engines from America.  Hence, they were not scheduled to arrive in the AEF Air Service operational units until May 1918.172  This meant that daylight bombers would arrive at the front months before night bombers.  Starting daytime operations would not only take the fight to the enemy sooner, but it would also provide pilots with experience navigating far behind the front lines without the extra complication of darkness.  While daylight losses might be higher, the Americans felt this tradeoff was worth the cost. Gorrell returned to his salesmanship in the conclusion of his proposal.  While this last section was brief, it was a clarion call to action.  A single sentence in the section sums up the entire proposal’s urgency: “Unless a decision is made to commence it immediately, we cannot hope to operate during 1918.”173  This tone must have resonated with Pershing who approved Gorrell’s plan on 5 January 1918.                                                 170 Morrow, German Air Power, 162. 171 Williams, “Shank of the Drill,” 401. 172 Memorandum to Air Service Chief of Staff, 18 January 1918, A-15, in

When the engine started to overheat, he made a forced landing inside enemy-controlled territory.

He spent the rest of the night in the wilderness until near dawn he happened upon a Mexican national.

From the beginning, the U.S. government and the Army in particular maintained policies adverse to the growth of a functional aviation industry.  This dated back to the Army’s initial position that all airframes had to be developed by the producer with no monetary support from the government.227  This effectively limited new developers as few had the funds on hand to produce aircraft without outside support.  The Army’s continual unwillingness to buy the large numbers of aircraft required to spur the growth of an aviation industry exacerbated this initial decision.

It was not until the end of September that the RNAS turned its bombers towards the zeppelins.  The service conducted four raids between 22 September and 25 December 1914.

Trenchard’s move coincided with a new raid by the Germans, who sent twenty-one Gothas over London on 7 July, causing fifty-four deaths and more than 200,000 pounds in damage.107  This new round of bombing turned the previous clamor into an uproar.  Fear gripped the public in ways that even the government focused on the front could not help but observe.  By the summer of 1917, up to 400,000 Londoners left the city or sought nightly air raid shelters.                                                  105 Harvey B.

File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 80 --- 74 Even the London newspapers were referring to the Gotha campaign as an aerial siege of the city.108 The public outcry soon drew action. On 7 August, Prime Minister David Lloyd George appointed a commission under the leadership of the South African soldier and statesman Gen. Jan Smuts to investigate the status of aviation and aerial defenses.  The Smuts Commission released two important findings that summer.  First, on 19 July 1917, the commission called for a reformation of the aerial defense system.  This led to the creation of a single command system integrating observers, command and control, antiaircraft artillery and interceptor aircraft.109   While this was an important step, the Smuts Commission’s second report released on 17 August had greater implications.  The report is most famous for recommending the formation of an independent Royal Air Force by combining the resources of the RFC and the RNAS, but it also had a significant effect on strategic bombing.  Section seven of the report gave a strategic direction to the new RAF when it said: The magnitude and significance of the transformation now in progress are not easily realized.

There he spent an undistinguished couple of years as a junior officer in Company L of the 30th Infantry before seeking reassignment to the Signal Corps.7  His dreams of flight finally came true with his transfer to the Aviation Section in December 1914.  The eager lieutenant arrived at Coronado, California, later that month itching to learn how to fly.  Gorrell joined a growing list of Air Service pioneers trained at the military’s west coast center for aviation on North Island, next to Coronado and across the bay from San Diego.  Gorrell proved to be an avid student and a steady pilot, receiving Expert Pilot License No. 39 in 1915.  At the same time, he joined another small, but growing group of international aviators, when he received Pilot’s License No. 324 from the Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI) later that year.8  Upon completion of his training, the Army assigned Gorrell, now a first lieutenant, to the 1st Aero Squadron.  The 1st started its life in September 1914 at North Island, but quickly deployed to Galveston, Texas, as part of the Army’s response to strained relations with Mexico.  When tensions on the border did not explode into fighting in 1915, the 1st Aero Squadron moved to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, for better flying and weather conditions.  While at Fort Sill, the squadron received their new Curtiss JN-3 aircraft.  The JN-3 proved underpowered and difficult to fly.  After several accidents with injuries, many of the artillery officers designated as spotters refused to fly unless “during war a

Gorrell and the other squadron pilots became dissatisfied with their aircraft and the missions they were given.  While this experience may have remained a localized concern, the grumblings of the aviators eventually became known in the halls of power in Washington.  Thus, Mexico served as an alarm clock for not only the pilots, but also for senior leaders as to the poor state of American military aviation preparedness.    This clock first rang on 19 March 1916, when the 1st Aero Squadron received orders to deploy to Nueva Casas Grandes.  Desiring to complete the move that day and restart observation missions the following morning, Foulois ordered his pilots to fly their aircraft to Nueva Casas Grandes, while the enlisted men packed the trucks and convoyed overnight to meet them.  Unfortunately, the squadron’s and its commander’s lack of experience combined to create a near disaster.  Foulois’s inexperience caused him to take the additional risk of an overnight deployment, when there was no external pressure for such a quick move.  Meanwhile, the squadron’s greenness meant that flight planning and equipment packing took much longer than expected.  The pilots did not depart from Columbus until 5:10 PM.  The delay meant that much of the flight occurred in darkness.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 37 --- 31 While some of the pilots had experience flying at night, none of them had flown long distances over sparsely inhabited territory in the dark.  The flight to Nueva Casas Grandes became the second life-changing moment for Gorrell.  From the start, things went awry.  Weighed down with fuel and personal baggage, Gorrell’s aircraft barely cleared a fence at the end of the field.34  The bad luck did not stop there.  As darkness fell, Gorrell lost sight of the other aviators in his formation.  He attempted to navigate alone, but became hopelessly lost over the darkened desert.  When he realized his predicam

The use of the Handley Page showcased the advantages offered by large multicrew aircraft for improved navigation, bombing accuracy, and defensive capabilities.  Meanwhile, the wing’s use of the Sopwith 1 ½ Strutter demonstrated the overwhelming requirement for a two-seat daylight bomber, leading to the highly capable DH 4.  Organizationally, 3 Wing highlighted the need for an independent bomber force.  The operational delays caused by logistics and inter service fighting hampered the wing’s operations.  When government attention once again turned towards strategic bombing as a priority, the lessons from 3 Wing drove their thinking.  Finally, the wing’s work with the French ingrained their target selection and prioritization schemes into British doctrine.                                                  100 Cross, The Bombers, 36.  File: --- morris_origins.pdf --- Page 76 --- 70 When the time came to develop a British bombing plan, French concepts provided guidance.   In this way, 1916 saw the tremendous cost of two massive ground offensives intervene to put strategic bombing on the back burner in all nations.  The French, caught off guard at Verdun, rapidly switched their priority to meet the German onslaught.  The British, on the other hand, meticulously prepared for the Somme, but a combination of Trenchard’s aggressive offensive plan and poor aircraft technology caused extremely high attrition rates.  In this light, British strategic bombing fell to an under-supported wing operating without strategic guidance.  Finally, the Germans were overwhelmed with the tactical air war and largely ignored strategic campaigns outside of a few raids.   Still, the year was not a total loss for strategic bombing.  The hard-won lessons the previous year remained intact and survived until the bombing’s renewal in 1917.  Additionally, the British learned important lessons through the limited operations of

Gorrell’s efforts prepared the squadron in just two short days.  When orders arrived on 12 March 1916, the 1st Aero Squadron left by rail for Columbus, with eight aircraft, eleven officers, eighty-two enlisted men, and ten trucks.14  By the time they arrived on the fifteenth, the ground forces had already left in two columns for Mexico.  This late arrival meant Foulois could not coordinate his unit’s first flights with the ground column commanders directly.  Yet, it did not hinder the squadron for long.

The trucks Gorrell bought before leaving San Antonio became a rare commodity in the confusion of the expedition’s advance.  Gorrell often drew double duty flying on one day and commanding truck convoys on another.  For instance, on 15 March he led a truck convoy bringing replacement officers and supplies to Las Palomas, Mexico.  Gorrell remembered the day in a later article, “what an experience it was, driving this original truck train into unfriendly territory, with a guard consisting of airplane mechanics.”15  Yet, once again the 1st Aero Squadron was splitting its duties when it should have been focusing on its primary mission of flying.  Why were untrained mechanics serving as convoy security?  Why was an extremely rare quantity, a qualified pilot, traipsing about the desert leading truck convoys?  Thes

These initial aircraft represented the beginning of a massive buildup of American combat air power in Europe.  Less than a month earlier, on 24 April 1942, Maj. Gen. Carl Spaatz had provided the strategic direction for these bombers when he established the headquarters 8th Air Force just thirty miles away at Bushy Park.1  At the time, the 8th commanded only a bomber group, a fighter group, and a transportation group, but these initial forces foreshadowed the rise of the “Mighty Eighth” into the formidable air fleets that attacked the Nazi war machine. While the deployment of the first bomber group to England may seem like the beginning of an epic history, in one way it was the end of another narrative.  The establishment of the 8th Air Force represented the fruition of a generation of air power dreamers stretching back to World War I.  This vision centered on one idea: aircraft could forever change the nature of warfare.  In the minds of forward thinking aerial theorists this new technology removed the limitations of geography, defenses, and operational reach that had restricted ground and naval forces since the dawn of human conflict.                                                   1 Geoffrey Perret, Winged Victory: The Army Air Forces in World War II (New York: Random House, 1993), 240.
