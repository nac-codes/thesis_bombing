In fact, it is irrelevant for our analysis whether the apparatus of coercion imposing the controls is the "legiti- mate" state apparatus or a sanctioned apparatus with public power. If a minimum wage that exceeds the unhampered market rate is imposed on a particular industry, its costs of production are raised, the price of the final product must rise, and correspondingly, sales must decline. Workers lose their jobs, which depresses wages in other industries. Up to this point we may agree with the wage fund theory on the effects of nonmarket wage boosts. That which the workers in one industry are gaining is lost by the workers in other industries. In order to avoid such consequences, the imposition of minimum wages must be accompanied by the prohibition to dismiss workers. The prohibition in turn reduces the industry's rate of return because unneeded workers must be paid, or they are used and paid in full pro- duction while their output is sold at a loss. Industrial activ- ity then tends to decline. If this, too, is to be prevented, government must intervene again with new regulations. If the minimum wage is not limited to a few industries, but is imposed on all industries of an isolated economy, or on the world economy, the rise in product prices caused by 148 it cannot lead to a reduction in consumption.2 The higher wages raise the workers' spending power. They can now buy the higher-priced products coming to the market. (To be sure, there may be shifting within the industries.) If en- trepreneurs and capitalists do not want to consume their capital they must limit their consumption since their money income has not risen and they are unable to pay the higher prices. To the extent of this reduction in consumption, the general wage boost has given the workers a share of entre- preneurial profits and capital income.

Production costs of Atlantean in- dustry remain at the old pre-import-duty levels. As sales in Thule decline Atlantean industry must discharge some workers. Unemployment compensation prevents the flow of unemployed labor to agriculture. Unemployment thus be- comes a permanent institution.7 The exportation of coal from Great Britain has declined. Inasmuch as the unneeded miners cannot emigrate-be- cause other countries do not want them-they must move to those British industries that are expanding in order to com- pensate for the smaller imports that follow the decline in ex- ports. A reduction in wage rates in coal mining may bring about this movement. But labor unions may hamper this unavoidable adjustment for years, albeit temporarily. In the end, the decline in the international division of labor must bring about a reduction in standards of living.

There is hope, perhaps, that the prod- uct price will rise again. In the meantime, production is con- tinued because the disadvantages of the shutdown are thought to be greater than the operating losses during the bad time. Until recently most unprofitable railroads were in this situation because automobiles and airplanes entered the competition. They counted upon an increase in traffic, hoping to earn profits some day. But if such special condi- tions do not exist, production is shut down. Enterprises la- boring under less favorable conditions disappear, which establishes the equilibrium between production and de- mand. Schmalenbach's error lies in his belief that the cutback in production, necessitated by the decline in prices, must take place through a proportionate cutback of all existing opera- tions. He forgets that there is yet another way, namely, the complete shutdown of all plants working under unfavorable conditions because they can no longer stand the competi- tion of plants producing at lower costs. This is true espe- cially in industries producing raw materials and staples. In finishing industries, where individual plants usually manu- facture various items for which production and market con- ditions may vary, a cutback may be ordered, limiting output to the more profitable items. This is the situation in a free economy unhampered by government intervention. Therefore, it is utterly erroneous to maintain that a rise in fixed costs denies our economy the ability to adjust production to demand.

The result is always the same: a given expenditure of capital and labor yields less with the restriction than without it, or from the beginning less capi- tal and labor is invested in production. This is true with protective tariffs that cause grain to be grown in less fertile soil while more fertile land is lying fallow, with class restric- tions of trade and occupation (such as the certificates of qualification for certain occupations in Austria, or the fa- vored tax treatment of small enterprises) which promote less productive businesses at the expense of more productive ac- 21  tivity, and, finally, with the limitation of labor time and of the employment of certain labor (women and children), which diminishes the quantity of available labor.

Wage controls can raise rates only temporarily, and only at the price of future wage reductions. The problem of wage controls is of such great importance today that we must analyze it in yet another way, taking into consideration the international exchange of goods. Let us suppose that economic goods are exchanged between two countries, Atlantis and Thule. Atlantis supplies industrial products, Thule agricultural products. Under the influence of Friedrich List,* Thule now deems it necessary to build its own industry by way of protective tariffs. The final outcome of Thule's industrialization program can be no other than that fewer industrial products are imported from Atlantis, and fewer agricultural products exported to Atlantis. Both countries now satisfy their wants to a greater degree from domestic production, which leaves the social product smaller than it used to be because production conditions are now less favorable. This may be explained as follows: in reaction to the im- port duties in Thule the Atlantean industry lowers its *Editor's note: A nineteenth century (1789-1846) German advocate of the use of pro- tective tariffs to stimulate national industrial development. 27  wages. But it is impossible to offset the whole tariff burden through lower wages. When wages begin to fall it becomes profitable to expand the production of raw materials. On the other hand, the reduction in Thulean sales of agricultural products to Atlantis tends to lower wages in the Thulean raw material production, which will afford the Thulean in- dustry the opportunity to compete with the Atlantean indus- try through lower labor costs.

Regarding the problem itself, Strigl's per- ceptive analysis comes to no conclusion other than that drawn in scientific economic analysis. The gist of his doc- trine is visible in the sentence: "The greater the service a worker can render, the more he will earn, provided his ser- vice is useful in the economy; it does not matter whether his wage is determined in the free market or agreed upon by collective contract."27 It obviously grieves him that this is so, but he cannot and will not deny it. Strigl emphasizes that artificial wage increases create un- employment. 28 This is undoubtedly the case where wages are raised in individual industries only, or in individual countries only, or where they are raised unevenly in differ- ent industries and countries, or where monetary policies are used to stem a general rise in prices. Undoubtedly Strigl's case is important for an understanding of present-day con- ditions. For a thorough understanding of the problem, how- ever, we must rely upon another basic assumption. To have universal validity our analysis must assume that the rise in wages occurs evenly and simultaneously in different indus- tries and countries, and that monetary factors do not inter- vene.

Supply and demand no longer coincide; demand exceeds supply, and the market mechanism, which tends to bring supply and demand to- gether through changes in price, no longer functions. Mere coincidence now eliminates as many buyers as the given supply cannot accommodate. Perhaps those buyers who come first or have personal connections with the sellers will get the goods. The recent war with its many attempts at price controls provided examples of both. At the official price, goods could be bought either by a friend of the seller or by an early bird in the "polonaise." But government can- not be content with this selection of buyers. It wants every- one to have the goods at lower prices, and would like to avoid situations in which people cannot get any goods for their money. Therefore, it must go beyond the order to sell; it must resort to rationing. The quantity of merchandise coming to the market is no longer left to the discretion of sellers and buyers. Government now distributes the avail- able supply and gives everyone at the official price what he is entitled to under the ration regulation. But government cannot even stop here. The intervention mentioned so far concerns only the available supply. When that is exhausted the empty inventories will not be replen- ished because production no longer covers its costs.

Inasmuch as the Socialists of the Chair repre- sented etatism, and inasmuch as they demanded the nation- alization of large enterprises and government supervision and control of all other enterprises, they engaged in socialis- tic politics. But not all Socialists of the Chair were etatists. Lujo Bren- tano and his School promoted a syndicalistic program, al- though in many questions of daily politics they joined ranks with the other Socialists of the Chair and, together with the Social Democrats, fought against liberalism. As set forth, their syndicalism is no more definite and straightforward than any other program. As a matter of fact, it is so contra- dictory and leads to such absurd consequences that it could never be unswervingly advocated. Brentano carefully veiled his position, but nevertheless it was syndicalism. It became visible in his position on the problems of labor union coer- cion and strike, and the protection of workers willing to work. If employees receive the right to shut down an enterprise as long as its owner rejects their demands, the control over production, in final analysis, has been placed in the hands of labor unions. The problem must not be obscured by the confusion between free collective bargaining-the workers' freedom to organize-and the impunity of workers guilty of breach of contract. The protection of workers willing to work is an entirely different matter. As long as the work stoppage of the workers of one enterprise or in an entire in- dustry can be rendered ineffective through employment of workers from other industries or from a given reservoir of unemployed workers, the labor unions are unable to raise wage rates above those paid without them.

The other group seeks to fix prices that differ from those of the market. The former may be called "restrictions of production"; the latter, generally known as price controls, we are calling "interference with the structure of prices." 3 3. There may be some doubt about the suitability of a third group: interference by taxation which consists of expropriation of some wealth or income. We did not allow for such a group because the effects of such intervention may in part be iden- tical with those of production restrictions, and in part consist of influencing the distribution of production income without redirecting production itself. 20 3. Restrictions of Production Economics need not say much about the immediate effect of production restrictions. Government or any organization of coercion can at first achieve what it sets out to achieve through intervention. But whether it can achieve the re- moter objectives sought indirectly by the intervention is a different question.

Let us further ignore increased demand for money due to delayed money delivery or clear- ing system limitations and other restrictions. We merely wish to analyze the consequences of a policy that aims at stabiliz- ing prices while the quantity of money is enlarged. The ex- pansion of money creates new demand that did not exist be- fore, "new purchasing power," as it is called. When the new buyers compete with those already in the market, and prices are not permitted to rise, only a part of demand can be satisfied. There are potential buyers who are willing to pay the price, but cannot find a supply. Government, which is circulating the newly created money, is seeking thereby to redirect commodities and services from previous uses to more desirable uses. It wants to buy them, not to commandeer them, which it certainly could do. Its intent is that money, only money, shall buy everything, and that potential buyers shall not be frustrated in their search for economic goods. After all, government itself wants to buy, it wants to use the market, not destroy it. The official price is destroying the market on which com- modities and services are exchanged for money.

Since the growth of fixed costs has not yet stopped and will probably continue for a long time, it is obviously hopeless to count on a return of the free economy.7 Schmalenbach at first offers proof for the relative rise in fixed costs with the remark that the continuous growth of enterprise size "is necessarily connected with an expansion, even a relative expansion, of the department that is heading the whole organization."8 I doubt that. The superiority of a larger enterprise consists, among other things, in manage- rial costs lower than those of smaller enterprises. The same is true for the commercial departments, especially the sales organizations. Of course, Schmalenbach is completely correct when he emphasizes that the costs of management and many other general costs cannot be reduced substantially when the en- terprise works only at one-half or one-fourth of its capacity. But as management costs decline with the growth of the en- terprise, calculated per unit of output, they are less signifi- cant in this age of big business and giant enterprises than formerly in the age of smaller operations. But Schmalenbach's emphasis is not here; it lies on the rise in capital intensity.

Obviously, the formation of cartels does not result from some development in the free economy, but is rather the consequence of the government interven- tion, i.e., the tariff. In the case of coal and brick, the trans- portation costs, which are so high relative to product value, may, under certain conditions and without government in- tervention, lead to the formation of cartels with limited local effectiveness. A few metals are found in so few places that even in a free economy the producers may attempt to form a world cartel. But it cannot be said too often that all other cartels owe their existence not to a tendency in a free econ- omy, but to intervention. International cartels generally can be formed only because important production and con- sumption areas are sheltered from the world market by tariff barriers. The formation of cartels has nothing to do with the ratio of fixed to proportional costs. The fact that the cartel forma- tion in the finishing industries is proceeding more slowly than in staple industries is not due to the slower rise in fixed costs, as Schmalenbach believes, but to the complex manu- facture of goods nearer to consumption, which is too intri- cate for cartel agreements. Furthermore, it is due to the dis- persal of production over numerous enterprises that are more vulnerable to competition by outsiders. The fixed costs, according to Schmalenbach, prod an en- terprise to embark upon expansion in spite of lacking de- 66 67  mand.

The concept of intervention as- sumes that private property is not abolished, but that it still exists in substance rather than merely in name. Nationaliza- tion of a railroad constitutes no intervention; but a decree that orders an enterprise to charge lower freight rates than it otherwise would is intervention. 3. Government measures that use market means, that is, seek to influence demand and supply through changes of 19  market factors, are not included in this concept of interven- tion. If government buys milk in the market in order to sell it inexpensively to destitute mothers or even to distribute it without charge, or if government subsidizes educational in- stitutions, there is no intervention. (We shall return to the question of whether the method by which government ac- quires the means for such actions constitutes "interven- tion.") However, the imposition of price ceilings for milk signifies intervention. Intervention is a limited order by a social authority forcing the owners of the means of production and entrepreneurs to employ their means in a different manner than they otherwise would. A "limited order" is an order that is no part of a socialist scheme of orders, i.e., a scheme of orders regulating all of production and distribution, thus replacing private prop- erty in the means of production with public property. Par- ticular orders may be quite numerous, but as long as they do not aim at directing the whole economy and replacing the profit motive of individuals with obedience as the driv- ing force of human action they must be regarded as limited orders.

In short, government as issuer of new money cannot escape the consequences described by the quantity theory. If government imposes a price higher than that deter- mined by the unhampered market, and prohibits the sale at lower prices (minimum prices), demand must decline. At the lower market price supply and demand coincide. At the 147  official higher price demand tends to trail supply, and some goods brought to the market cannot find a buyer. As gov- ernment imposed the minimum price in order to assure the sellers profitable sales, the result was unintended by gov- ernment. Therefore, it must resort to other means, which again, step by step, must lead to complete government con- trol over the means of production.

Such rates may be set either directly by government or indirectly by promoting labor union policies that aim at establishing minimum wages.

If wages are freely determined in the labor market, no raise in wages above the market rate can occur as a result of interventions, such as the shortening of labor time, mandatory insurance of workers at the expense of employers, regulations of work- shop conditions, vacations of workers with full pay, et cetera. All these costs are shifted to wages and are borne by 17. See my Gemeinwirtschaft, Jena, 1922, p. 382 et seq.

This fact could be overlooked because such social interventions were introduced mainly at a time when real wages were rising and the purchasing power of money was falling. Thus, net wages paid to workers continued to rise in terms of both money and purchasing power despite the ever-rising social costs placed on the employer. His calculations include not only the workers' wages, but also all costs resulting from their employment. Clark's further remarks have no bearing on our problem. He believes that wage increases, like other interventions on behalf of workers, "may prove self-sustaining through rais- ing the level of personal efficiency, through furnishing an added stimulus to the employer's search for improved methods, and through hastening the elimination of the least efficient employers and transfering their business to those who will conduct it more efficiently." 19 All this can also be said about an earthquake or any other natural catastrophe. Professor Clark is trained too well in theory and is too per- ceptive not to notice how untenable his reasoning actually is. He concludes, therefore, that the question of whether or not a given intervention is a "violation of economic law" is ba- sically "a question of degree." In the final ana

But this escape has been closed. Unem- ployment, a friction phenomenon that soon disappears in an 6. It should be noted that we are not dealing here with the question of whether or not wage rates can be raised permanently and universally through collective bar- gaining, but with the consequences of a general wage boost achieved artificially through physical coercion. To avoid a theoretical difficulty pertaining to money, namely that a general rise in prices is impossible without a change in the ratio be- tween the quantity of money and its demand, we may assume that together with the boost in wages a corresponding reduction in the demand for money takes place through a reduction in cash holdings (e.g., as a result of additional paydays). 26 unhampered market order, becomes a permanent institu- tion in interventionism. As government did not mean to create such a condition, it must intervene again. It forces employers either to rein- state the unemployed workers and pay the fixed rate, or to pay taxes that compensate the unemployed. Such a burden consumes the owners' income, or at least reduces it greatly. It is even conceivable that the entrepreneurs' and owners' income no longer can carry this burden, but that it must be paid out of capital. But if nonlabor income is consumed by such burdens we realize that it must lead to capital con- sumption. Capitalists and entrepreneurs, too, want to con- sume and live even when they are earning no incomes. They will consume capital. Therefore, it is unsuitable and illogical to deprive entrepreneurs, capitalists, and land owners of their incomes and leave control over the means of produc- tion in their hands. Obviously, the consumption of capital in the end reduces wage rates. If the market wage structure is unacceptable the whole private property order must b

The workers' real raise is visible in that prices do not rise by the full amount of the wage boost because of the entrepreneurs' and capital- ists' cutback in consumption. That is, the rise in consumer prices is less than that of wages. But it is well known that even if all property income were divided among the work- ers, their individual incomes would rise very little, which should dispel any illusion about such a reduction in prop- erty income. But if we were to assume that the wage boost and rise in prices should allocate a large part, if not all, of the real income of entrepreneurs and capitalists to workers, we must bear in mind that the former want to live and will therefore consume their capital for lack of entrepreneurial income. Elimination of capital income through coercive wage boosts thus merely leads to capital consumption, and thereby to continuous reduction in national income. (By the way, every attempt at abolishing capital income must have the same consequence unless it is achieved through all- round nationalization of production and consumption.) If again government seeks to avoid these undesirable effects, no alternative is left, from the etatist point of view, but to seize control over the means of production from the owners. Our discussion applies only to those price controls that endeavor to set prices differing from those of the un- hampered market. If the controls should seek to undercut monopolistic prices, the consequences are quite differ- ent. Government then may effectively intervene anywhere 2. We are ignoring the monetary forces' exerting their influence on prices. 149  in the range between the higher monopolistic price and the lower competitive price. Under certain conditions price con- trols may deprive a monopolist of specific monopolistic gains. Let us assume, for instance, that in an isolated econ- omy a sugar cartel is holding sugar
