The consolations of religion have for the moment lost their efficacy in large sections of the European population. The zeal of the young and ardent is thrown into schemes of social regeneration. Such schemes are everywhere, whether they take the form of personal work among the poor and the sick, or trades-union politics, or visions of progressive legislation moving step by step towards an improved society, or propaganda leading up to the social revolution and common ownership of all land, machinery and productive organization ; or the blind schemes of murder and destruction nursed in garrets and basements by the half-mad apostles of militant Anarchism. All these schemes alike are materialistic in their aims ; their kingdom is of this world; they seek for no spiritual compensations, they admit no spiritual rapture ; their professors represent all grades between the extreme of self-devotion and the culmination of hate, envy and greed. But the belief in the possibility of social reform by conscious effort is the most dominant in the modern European mind ; it has superseded the old belief in Liberty as the one panacea ; even Bismarck paid homage to it ; and no modern statesman can afford to ignore it. Its substantial achievements, and perhaps its disappointments, are in the future ; but its currency in the present is as significant and as pregnant as the belief in the Rights of Man about the time of the French Revolu- tion."

THE YEAR OF MORAL ATTRITION Though the physical attrition of 1916 was to continue, the main characteristic of 1917 was the moral attrition of all sides. On the part of the Central Powers this was inevitable. The world having now turned against Germany, its moral support was denied to her, and without it she was henceforth reduced to make demands on the morale of her people without being in any way able to replenish it from outside. On the part of the Entente Powers, the reason for their moral decadence was the opposite. The world was now definitely ranged on their side, and, as we shall see, early in this year America full-heartedly joined their cause. It was not, therefore, outside influence which depressed them, but inside lack of co-ordination. Whilst Germany was able to back her fighting forces by her superb though dwindling patriotism, the Entente Powers had no similar force to unify and stimulate them. The lack of a controlling brain, an organ which could consider one thing at one time, in place of all things at any time, led to intense friction-military and political. Whilst Germany was still controlled by a national spirit, the Entente, as an entity, was obsessed by mob instincts-its members were not only fearful of the common enemy but sus- picious of each other. Germany was being morally exhausted through outside pressure, and the Entente Powers through a creeping internal paralysis. No sooner had the Entente Governments rejected the German peace proposals than the Central Powers made one further attempt to regain world opinion by repudiat- ing any further responsibility for continuing the war, and declaring that, as the war was now forced upon them, they would fight for their hearths and homes to the bitter end. Having thus attempted to place herself in the right, eight days later, on January II, Germany committed an egregious poli

On Septem- ber 26, 1815, two months before the second Treaty of Paris was signed, Alexander of Russia, a religious fanatic, persuaded the Emperor of Austria and the King of Prussia to sign with him, " In the name of the Most Holy and Indivisible Trinity," a treaty named " The Holy Alliance." Metternich called it " loud-sounding noth- ing," and Castlereagh " a piece of sublime mysticism and nonsense." It was both, and to it may be traced turmoil and revolution from then onwards to 1849. The " blessings which it has pleased Divine Providence to shower down " on the conquering States were to be rendered permanent, while the spirit of awakened nationalism was to be suppressed. The principles of rule were to be those of " Holy Religion .. . Justice, Christian Charity and Peace." Princes were to look upon themselves as delegates of Providence, and the peoples were to be brought to realize this and exercise " the duties which the Divine Saviour has taught to mankind." Later on the Kings of Naples and Sardinia, Louis XVIII and Ferdinand of Spain subscribed to this treaty. In England the Prince Regent refused to do so, and the only two potentates who received no invitation were the Pope and the Sultan of Turkey ! In the West the answer to this sublime nonsense was the establishment of the " Monroe Doctrine " on December 2, 1823.

The inmates of a lunatic asylum could have foreseen that this was the only answer, and as the statesmen of the Allied Powers were not altogether insane, why did not they foresee it ? They probably did, but were afraid to say so because the truth would have run counter to popular opinion, which is always wrong. So, fearing popular opinion more than they reverenced truth, when Germany offered to pay in goods or in service they answered : " Oh ! no, that would reduce the standard of living of our workers and throw them out of employment. Pay you shall, but not in goods." Then when no payment was made Germany was threatened with punishment for evading payment. Meanwhile the Americans, who had come into the war to make the world safe for democracy, instead of 247 looking upon the debts the Allied Powers had contracted with them as subsidies towards the accomplishment of this end, saw in these debts a political instrument whereby they might coerce Europe ; for the post-war United States, like pre-war Germany, wanted to make history as well as gold. In the ancient days of monarchies kings would at times pawn their crowns to help their friends ; but the Americans are a democratically minded people ; for over two generations they had been breaking each other by trade corners and graft ; and as they are an ignorant people it was only natural and logical for them to con- sider that this was the opportunity to break Europe. But instead, with the assistance of France, they broke the back of their own prosperity and then, realizing that their debts would never be paid to them, because to receive them in goods would dislocate their own industries, President Hoover, in June, 1932, with a gesture of " generosity " seldom equalled in history, hinted : " If you European nations will disarm I will forego these debts !

THE GROUPING OF THE NATIONS Meanwhile other forces, more occult, have been at work ; for in spite of the rise of new nations, and the increasing agitation by fractions of old nations to gain their political liberty however much it might clash with their economic interests, simultaneously with the ending of the war do we see emerging out of nationalism itself the formation of amorphous groups of nations. In Russia, the revolution of 1917, shattering an empire, theoretically at least created a number of Soviet republics which socially and politically were autonomous ; yet it simultaneously gave birth to the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics, which super-State retains economic autonomy in its own hands. In America this evolution had been reached after the Civil War, which in its own sphere may be compared to the Russian revolution.

During the conflict with Russia many troops had left India for the seat of war ; and in 1856 Canning, a weak man, who succeeded Dalhousie as Viceroy, upset the Indian Army by changing the recruiting regulations. All this was extremely foolish, for regimental mutinies had already occurred in 1843, 1844 and 1849. The condition of the Army was normal ; that is to say it was rotten, for military efficiency is a rarity in India. The officers were inefficient and untrained, and were very much as they are described in the following letter addressed to Colonel Doyle, Military Secretary, on October 31, 1817, by a subordinate officer stationed at Agra : "My dear Doyle,-The dawk [post] hour is approaching, so I must address you quickly. I had this morning for the first time a field day of instruction for my infantry brigade. . . " Commanding officers very rusty. One is deaf and blind- literally so. The second has never been before out acting with another regiment in line. " A third has never been in command till within the last few days. The fourth has a voice like thunder, a figure like Lumbo Panjo, a seat in his saddle like a washball, but a clear head, and knows what he is about." (14) In 1857, officers were sent out totally ignorant of the customs of the country. For instance, one engaging a servant asked him what his caste was, and got the reply : " Same caste as master, drink brandy sahib." Another, Colonel David Wood, of the Horse Artillery, " during dinner .. . turned gravely to one of the old Indian officers and said, ' Can you tell me what is a dhobie ?

I told mine to clean my horse and he refused.' " (15) The Mutiny began at Meerut on May 11, 1857.

" There can be no doubt that, by instituting unrestricted submarine warfare the Germans violated certain laws of war made long before the advent of this weapon ; but also there can be no doubt that, if the slow starvation of German men, women and children by means of investment did not contravene the spirit of international law, then neither did unrestricted submarine warfare contravene it, though it may have infringed the letter of the tradition which this law had created.

The drowning of non-combatants is but an incident in the operation of killing by starvation, it does not affect the principle underlying this act."

Economically every nation depended on the combined prosperity of all nations. and in the main, being followers of Clausewitz, soldiers and statesmen should have realized that when he declared that war was a continuation of peace policy in another form he did not mean that it was a negation of peace policy. Yet their actions resulted in this negation, because in the days when Clausewitz outlined his doctrine all nations were economically independent, and during the three generations following his death they had become economically interdependent.

These two men were to found a new form of war which reached its climax in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and has not yet run its course. Opposed to Socialism, yet akin to it, was the rising spirit of Humanitarianism. Whilst the one caught hold of the principle of equality the other caught hold of that 43 of fraternity. Both were symptons of the religious revival which the prolonged wars had stimulated, and it is no coincidence that the word " Socialism " became current about the same time that Newman began the Oxford Movement in 1833. Whilst Socialism aimed at bettering the condition of the workers Humanitarianism aimed at bettering the condition of the Negroes. In 1807 the slave trade was abolished by act of Parliament, and in 1834 the slaves were emancipated in the West Indies. These fervent one-eyed people " could spare no sympathy for men of their own colour. They did not rally, as might have been expected, to the help of the Tory Lord Ashley when, in 1833, he sought to regulate the employment of English children in factories " ; (10) neither did they in the least interest themselves in the welfare of the soldier who lived in conditions far worse than most of the West Indian slaves.

As the nineteenth century passes away we enter an age of contradictions, of blood-red sunsets and glimmer- ing false dawns ; of disquisitions on peace and war, wealth and poverty, socialism and capitalism and this thing and that thing, all girt about and riveted loosely together by ignorance and opportunism, and fused into an amorphous mass by a venal, sensation-loving Press which stood for the spirit of democracy, and did in fact fairly represent it, since it howled for action with one voice and condemned it with the other. It is an age of excessive spending. Thus, in 1872, elementary education in Great Britain cost £1,500,000, in 1908 it cost £16,000,000 ; the cost of the British Army in 1892 was £17,000,000, and in 1906 £29,000,000. 18I  182 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION RET TURMOIL OF THE NATIONS From these figures we can clearly deduce one fact, namely that the increased education of the masses does not necessarily tend towards peacefulness. This fact is, I think, supported by history ; for if the period 1814- 1914 is examined it will at once be discovered that during its first forty years there were thirteen wars of import- ance, and during its last sixty, thirty-three. This is scarcely an earnest of the peaceful nature of democracies. Nevertheless, in 1907 the second Peace Conference assembled at the Hague, yet it accomplished so little that two years later Lord Rosebery said ; " Armaments are increasing, this calm before the storm is terrifying." (1) Between 1898 and 1908 the European war budgets rose by £100,000,000, and again between 1908 and 1914 by a similar sum. As expenditure on armaments tended towards war, so did expenditure on social reforms tend towards revolution. Both meant national and inter- national bankruptcy. War, or revolution, which was it to be ? We will attempt to trace the answer to the question.

This is realized by Germany and her Allies, for, on December 12, they each separately presented notes to the United States Ambassadors in their respective countries request- ing them to inform the Governments of the Entente Powers that they were ready to negotiate for peace. On December 30, the Entente Powers rejected these proposals. During this year we see developing the physical attrition of both sides ; but, added to this, the Central Powers are also suffering from a moral attrition, and as they lose neutral support so do their opponents gain it. The Entente Powers began to attempt some co-ordina- tion of policy and effort. On January 24 the first Military Service Bill was passed by the House of Commons, and, before the end of the year, National Service was established in Great Britain. On March 26-28 an Inter-Allied Conference was assembled at Paris to enquire into military, economic and diplomatic affairs, and another was assembled, on November 15, at which policy and strategy were discussed. Then, on December 7, the greatest impetus was given for the continuance of the war : Mr. Lloyd George succeeded Mr. Asquith as British Premier, and two days later a War Cabinet was formed in London. The reconstruc- tion of the British Government was immediately followed by the reorganization of the French, and on the very day that this took place, namely, December 12, the Central Powers indented their peace notes to the United States Ambassadors.

Whether or not it halts to fire, it will be a target for the other body which awaits it, calm, ready, sure of its effects. The whole first rank of the assailant falls, smashed. The remainder, little encouraged by their reception, disperse automatically or before the least indication of an advance on them. Is this what happens ? Not at all ! The moral eff

Delcassé was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs, a more friendly feeling was shown towards England. During the South African War no advance could be made, but shortly after its ending, as an answer to the German naval threat, King Edward VII, who had succeeded to the throne on January 22, 1901, visited Paris and by his charm and astuteness won the hearts of the French. A return visit to London was made by President Loubet, and a bargain having been arranged over the Egyptian and Morocco questions, a definite entente was established in 1904. This understanding shattered the German policy of setting France and England at loggerheads, so Germany turned to Russia. On July 23, 1905, a meeting took place between the Kaiser and the Czar at Bjorko, and the following day, on board the Hohenzollern, William, in order to establish a coalition against England, persuaded Nicholas to sign a secret treaty pledging that " if any European State shall attack either Power the other will aid with all its forces." Nicholas was to make these terms known to France and " invite her to sign it as an ally."(3) The Czar's ministers were astounded when they discovered what had taken place, and the treaty was scrapped because it was obvious that France would never agree to an alliance with Germany, as this would carry with it a recognition of the settlement made under the Treaty of Frankfort. Great Britain then turned to Russia and an arrange- ment was arrived at in which the outstanding difficulties over Tibet, Afghanistan and Persia were settled. Thus was a Triple Entente established to face the Triple Alliance. As Mr. Gooch says : " The two parties- Great Britain and Japan on the one side, Russia and France  186 WAR AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION RET TURMOIL OF THE NATIONS on the other-had now made friends. Russia had no longer to think of the perils of the Far East, and could turn her undivided attention to the even more dangerous game of European politics."(4) This year Franc

(19) All this was gradually changed by the spirit of the French Revolution. A new order of living and of killing emerged out of the cry of " Vive la nation ! Vive les sansculottes !" The occult powers behind the destiny of the efflorescent world were wealth and public opinion -economics and emotionalism. " The only premonitory indication of war, in our democratic epoch," writes M. René Pinon, "is the temper of public opinion. When a nation's pulse beats at the fever cadence, when its blood is boiling and the whole organism shivers and trembles, the danger is near. At such psychological moments in the life of a people, arguments based on Constitutional Law have no longer any hold, and Gov- ernments become powerless to arrest the impulses of the nation. The epoch of the old " politiques des Cabinets " has gone by, and the best diplomatist to-day is he who is able to penetrate the deep-lying intentions of the people and to divine their spontaneous impulses." (20) These impulses in their present day form date from 1789-1792, from the day of the storming of the Bastille and the Garde Nationale, a force of some 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 citizens, out of which emerged Napoleon's 29 conscript army. An army living on the countries it invaded, an army which welcomed talent and which reduced fighting to bludgeon work. Nevertheless, how different was war then from what it is to-day. At Jena we find the Prussian army nearly perishing of cold close by huge stacks of felled wood and not daring to touch them, whilst after Auerstädt the troops went for two days without provisions because to requisition from the peasants would have been a " system of robbery ... unknown in the Prussian army, and repugnant to

On his release he organized " La Giovene Italia," or Young Italy Movement, upon whose banner was inscribed on one side " Unity " and " Independence," and on the other " Liberty," " Equality " and " Humanity "-its national and international aims. Between 1824 and 1847 it was Mazzini more than any other man who broke the period of " pacific beatitude " in Tuscany. In March revolution broke out in Vienna ; whereupon Metternich fled to England to walk the parade of Brighton. Then followed a general upheaval throughout the Empire. Revolution in Vienna at once led to revolution in Milan and then in Venice, where, on March 22, a Republic was proclaimed to the shouts of " Viva San Marco." Where- upon Radetzky, the Austrian commander, moved on Verona and Mantua placing his army in the Quadrilateral flanked by the rivers Mincio and Adige, and protected by the fortresses of Verona, Mantua, Peschiera and Legnano. Charles Albert King of Piedmont, now decided on war, and he was urged on by that formidable patriot Camillo di Cavour in his paper Risorgimento. All Italy was behind the King ; but whilst in Rome people breathed war, the Pontiff breathed peace, for nationalism terrified him, and what he wanted was a League of Italian States. Whilst a Tuscan army watched Mantua and a Sardinian lay siege to Peschiera, Charles Albert and the bulk of his forces moved northwards to cut Verona from the Tyrol. Then, on April 29, the Pope denounced the war which deprived the king of the support of the Southern States, and, on May 6, Charles Albert was defeated at Santa Lucia and compelled to fall back on the Mincio. On July 25 he was again defeated at Custozza and the Austrians entered Milan. But Radetzky, fearing the intervention of France and Great Britain, in place of marching on

On January 14 an attempt on the life of the French Emperor was made by Orsini, and though it failed it had a strange influence on the political situation. As the plot had been hatched in London, France accused England of sheltering political assassins. This led to the " Panic of 1859," the fear that France was about to invade England, and 79 the Volunteer Movement of this same year. Then, on February 11, Orsini wrote to Louis Napoleon exhorting him to support Italian freedom. The Emperor, thoroughly terrified, thus came to believe that unless he took up arms in favour of Italy other attempts on his life would follow. Orsini had attacked him because he was an autocrat, and this attack had turned him into a democrat. Seldom, if ever, has a would-be political assassin so completely gained his point. And in the meanwhile other influences were at work. From the fatal field of Novara onwards, Cavour, that " scientific intriguer," never for a moment changed his purpose-the driving of the Austrians out of Italy. Italy could not do so single-handed, an alliance was essential, and to gain an ally he plunged Sardinia into the Crimean War. It was a premeditated act to liberate Italy, and it had nothing whatever to do with maintaining the Ottoman Empire. Of it Fyffe writes : " His Crimean policy is one of those excessively rare instances of statesmanship where action has been determined not by the driving and half-understood necessities of the moment, but by a distinct and true perception of the future. He looked only in one direction, but in that direction he saw clearly . . . every Italian whom Cavour sent to perish on the Tchernaya or in the cholera-stricken camps died as directly for the cause of Italian independence as if he had fallen on the slopes of Custozza or under the walls of Rome." (20) As Cavour found it impossible to establish an alliance with England he somewhat reluctantly turned to France. Louis Napoleon wanted to regain Savoy and Nice, which
