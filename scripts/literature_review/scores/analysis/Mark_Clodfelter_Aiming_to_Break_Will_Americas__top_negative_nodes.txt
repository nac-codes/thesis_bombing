Much of the Air Force’s focus on will stems fromprewar bombing doctrine and America’s initial effort to break an enemy’s morale with bombs – the aerial assault on Nazi Germany. That bombing revealed that a nation-state’s will to resist actually consists of three distinctive elements – the willof its populace, government leaders, and the armed forces – which together form a collective desire to ﬁght. The bombing also showed that the resilience of the individual components depends on the strength of the bonds that connect them andthe war aims pursued by all belligerents. It further illustrated that the individualelement most likely to break from air attack is the will of the armed forces.

By announcing that the German people had no recourse save total capitulation, Allied leaders greatly diminished the possibility that a single blow, or that even a series of disasters, couldproduce surrender. 68The Allied policy undercut resistance efforts in Germany, and caused many German generals to keep ﬁghting afterall hope of victory had vanished.69For civilians struggling to survive the bombing, unconditional surrender strengthened their stoic deter-mination to endure the ordeal. ‘The civilian population bore the burdenplaced on it because no one offered any alternative’, observed Hans Rumpf, a German civil defense ofﬁcial during the war. ‘There was nothing else they could do. There was no way out.’ 70 While nationalism was a unifying factor, so too were the Nazis’ chief elements of state control, the Schutzstaffel (SS) and the Gestapo. Themilitary organization of the Nazi Party, the SS contained ﬁve millionmembers by the end of the war. In 1938 it absorbed the Gestapo,or state secret police, which ultimately totaled between 40,000 and50,000 personnel. 71Together,

They will destroy the means of making war.’17These attacks would also wreck the enemy’s will to ﬁght by driving civiliansaway from cities so that they could not work, creating a ‘wild anddisorderly exodus’ in which the populace could be neither fed nor housed. ‘There is only one alternative and that is surrender’, Mitchell elaborated in 1930, but to him capitulation would stem fromhopelessness rather than rebellion. 18 The conviction that a nation’s ‘will to ﬁght’ matched the desire of its populace to support the war effort was shared not only by Gorrell andMitchell, but also by the instructors at Maxwell Field’s Air CorpsTactical School, Montgomery, Alabama. Those instructors furtherbelieved that national morale was vulnerable to bombing. At the school, which provided an intense, year-long, airpower-focused curriculum to many of the future air commanders of World War II,instructors reﬁned the notions of Gorrell and Mitchell. Majors DonaldWilson, Harold Lee George, and Muir S. Fairchild debated the meritsof attacking civilian morale, and ultimately developed an approach thatwould guide not only American air offensives in World War II, but alsothose in the limited wars that followed. The Tactical School instructors acknowledged that direct attacks on civilian populations were ‘one recognized method’ of attacking an enemy state. ‘There is, however, considerable question that this methodof attack is the best and most efﬁcient method’, Major Fairchildasserted in a 1938 lecture on ‘National Economic Structures’: Obviously we cannot and do not intend, to actually kill or injure allthe people.

The American ofﬁcer based this assertionon his analysis of German newspaper articles. 14 Aircraft production delays prevented the implementation of Gorrell’s plan, but the young planner was not alone in believing that aconcentrated air offensive against Germany could have achievedvictory. ‘I was sure that if the war lasted, airpower would decide it’,Brigadier General William ‘Billy’ Mitchell stated after the armistice. 15 Had the war continued into 1919, Mitchell planned an aerial assaultagainst the interior of Germany that would have combined incendiaryattacks with poison gas to destroy crops, forests, and livestock. He mused that such an air offensive ‘would have caused untold sufferings’ and forced a German surrender. 16Like Gorrell, Mitchell believed that an enemy’s will to ﬁght equaled popular support for the war effort, andMitchell thought that bombs could destroy morale effectively withoutdirectly targeting the civilian populace.

Observers seem to be of the opinion that the Japanese air attacks on cities have hadthe effect of unifying the Chinese people in opposition to theJapanese to a greater extent than any other factor. It is apparent that if Air Warfare is to succeed in the direct attack against morale, that it must create such an abnormal environmentthat continued sacriﬁce of the individual for the common good becomes intolerable. 19 Fairchild concluded that the uncertain results of direct attacks on civilian morale precluded such a focus if an air campaign were to have areasonable chance of success.

A series of such front-line collapses like ‘Cobra’ – especially ones occurring simultaneously on the Eastern, Italian and Western Fronts – could have ultimately produced awidespread collapse of will from the Germany military. That loss ofwill may well have been the linchpin triggering a comprehensivecollapse in the nation-state’s overall desire to continue the war.

Moreover, the greatly enhanced accuracy provided by truly smart bombs has takenaway the fear factor that Gorrell and Mitchell believed would induce apopulace to rise against a government that could not protect it from airattack. Although the continued reﬁnement of precision-guided munitionsmakes it less likely that air strikes will kill civilians or crack their morale,today’s accuracy signiﬁcantly improves the prospects that airpower canbreak the will of troops in the ﬁeld. The desertion of almost 100,000 Iraqi soldiers after 38 days of continual pounding from the air during the First Persian Gulf War provides just one example of the impact that‘modern’ bombing can have on the psyche of front-line troops. 105 Nonetheless, since the air war against Germany, US Air Force doctrine has continued to stress airpower’s perceived ability to wreckenemy will, and it has equated will to civilian morale or the fortitude ofgovernment leaders. Part of the problem is that many American airmenhave viewed subsequent examples of seemingly successful strategic 104Perret, Winged Victory , 199–201; Christopher F.

Moral qualms and the ﬁrmly held conviction that attacks aimed at war-making capability were more productive than those aimed at theenemy populace combined to prevent American air leaders from launching a wholesale campaign aimed at killing German civilians. Air commanders continued to believe that the essence of German moralewas public support for the war, and that such support was fragile, butthey agonized over how best to attack it. In their minds, attackingcivilians indirectly – by terrorizing them rather than killing them, or by depriving them of needed goods and services – was the answer. Yet thedifference between attacks intended to terrorize, and those intended tokill, was a ﬁne one, and the distinction tended to blur as the war progressed. General Eaker, who had left the Eighth Air Force in January 1944 to become the Allied air commander in the Mediterra-nean, commented at length on the dilemma. Spaatz had requestedEaker’s views on ‘Clarion,’ a plan designed not only to disrupttransportation links in small towns, but also to showcase the might ofAllied airpower to German citizens unfamiliar with its fury. Eaker didnot mince his words on the proposal: It [‘Clarion’] will absolutely convince the Germans that we are the barbarians they say we are, for it would be perfectly obvious tothem that this is primarily a large-scale attack on civilians as, infact, it of course will be. Of all the people killed in this attack over95% of them can be expected to be civilians. It is absolutely contrary to the conversations you and [Air Secretary] Bob Lovett had with respect to the necessity of sticking to military targets. . . . If the time ever comes when we want to attack the civilian populace with a view to breaking civil morale, such a plan as theone suggested is

For most American airmen, though,airpower made the decisive difference in breaking Japanese will. Theexample of Japan served as proof that the effort against Germany hadbeen worthwhile and the principles that guided it were correct. TheJapanese example further provided signiﬁcant impetus to fulﬁll theairmen’s dream of service independence, a goal achieved in September 1947. After gaining autonomy, the airmen hearkened to the teachings of the Air Corps Tactical School when they ﬁrst committed their doctrineto paper during the early years of the Dwight Eisenhower administra-tion. Most considered the recently concluded Korean War, with itspolitical constraints on bombing, as an anomaly that would vanish inthe era of ‘massive retaliation’. Yet they also believed that airpower wasthe answer to winning anyconﬂict that appeared on the horizon. ‘Of the various types of military forces, those which conduct air operations are most capable of decisive results’, proclaimed the AirForce’s Basic Doctrine Manual in April 1955. ‘They provide the dominant military means of exercising the initiative and gaining 109See Message, War Dept. to CG US Army Strategic Air Forces, Guam to War Dept., 8 Aug. 1945, eyes only for Spaatz from Marshall; and Message, Headquarters, US ArmyStrategic Air Forces, Guam to War Dept, 9 Aug. 1945, eyes only for Gen.

The precision attacks against industry and transportation failedto disrupt the ‘normal, day-to-day lives’ of the German people to such adegree that they stopped supporting the struggle. The radar bombing,which mirrored the RAF’s area attacks in destructiveness and accuracy,and became more and more common as the war continued, also failed to wreck the morale of the populace. Bombing’s direct effects on daily activities, such as the loss of mail, telephone, gas, water, electric andsanitary services, the disruption of public transportation, and thereduction in both quality and quantity of food, caused civilian moraleto decline, but the decline was never signiﬁcant enough to stimulateaction against the Nazi regime. Moreover, the members of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey found that once bombing had produced a ‘moderate’ level of deprivation, increased destruction had a marginal impact on reducing the will to ﬁght. 54The Survey noted that the morale of individuals subjected to very heavy bombing actually improved slightly comparedto the morale of those subjected to less intense attacks. Theimprovement came not because people supported the war moreenthusiastically, but because the heavy bombing made them apatheticand less likely to criticize the war effort. ‘Under conditions of severeraids their thoughts centered on the immediate personal problems of 52Letter, Eaker to Spaatz, marked ‘General Spaatz’ Eyes Only’, 1 Jan. 1945; Personal Diary (Jan. 1945) File, Box 20, Spaatz Papers. 53Craven and Cate, Army Air Forces in World War II , Vol. III, 733–5. 54USSBS, The Effects of Strategic Bombing on German Morale , Vol. I, May 1947, 28.America’s World War II Bombing of German Morale 417  File: --- clodfelter_will.pdf --- Page 19 --- foxhole existence’, the Survey observed.55To the typical German civilian, the disruption of the ‘industrial web’ created inconveniencesthat could be overcome; heavier attacks produced fatalistic attitudesand a
