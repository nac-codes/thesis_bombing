The destruction of those target systems would, the plannersbelieved, also destroy the ‘means of livelihood of the German people’and their will to support the war. 25The planners estimated that wrecking German war-making capability would take six months of concentrated aerial assaults, and that such attacks probably could not begin until the spring of 1944 (assuming war began in early 1942)because of the time needed to produce an adequate bomber force. Although they stressed precision attacks against industry, the planners did not completely rule out the possibility of direct attacks on theGerman civilian populace. Their rationale for such attacks was twofold:they believed that raids on urban centers might provide the ﬁnal impetusneeded to make a battered Germany surrender, thus saving Allied lives that would be lost if the struggle persisted; and a coup de gra ˆce administered by airpower would demonstrate in convincing fashion thatthe independent application of airpower had won the war and providestrong rationale for an independent Air Force.

Kuter thought that the impetus for theBritish proposal might have stemmed from their desire to retaliate for the recent buzz (V1 ﬂying) bomb attacks against England. He noted that area bombing had caused little absenteeism and only apathy anddiscouragement among the German workers, which were doubtfulqualities to spark a revolt. Although Kuter realized that the intent of‘Thunderclap’ was to break the will of the German leaders, he alsoobserved that civilians would bear the brunt of the attacks. ‘Thebombing of civilian targets in Germany cannot be expected to havesimilar effects to those which might be expected in a democratic country where the people are still able to inﬂuence the national will’, he asserted. Kuter reiterated that American target policy hinged onattacking military objectives and German production centers, and thatit was ‘contrary to our national ideals to wage war against civilians’.Yet he conceded that a time might arrive when attacks ‘against otherthan objectives immediately related to the battle’ might tip the balance.Thus, although strongly opposed to the British proposal, he recom-mended preparing a plan for it. 39 After examining the arguments, General Arnold directed USSTAF to develop a plan for including British and American air forces in an ‘all-out, widespread attack’ against Germany that would last roughly aweek.

The ‘carpet’ bombing was not a perfectreplication of the apocalypse, though, for 42 heavy bombers mistakenlydropped their ordnance on friendly troops and killed 111 of them,including observer Lieutenant General Lesley McNair. 90Journalist Ernie Pyle was with American front-line soldiers as the bombs crept towards his position and wrote afterwards: ‘An indescribable kind ofpanic comes over you at such times. We stood tensed in muscle andfrozen in intellect.’ 91 Despite the losses from ‘friendly’ ﬁre, ‘Cobra’s’ thunder paved the way for American forces to break through dense German defenses in thehedgerows and begin the sweep across northern France.

Once over Berlin, however, crews foundthe skies predominantly clear, and most bombed visually. Almost 1,000B-17s dropped 2,279 tons of bombs on the city, causing heavy damageto the Reichschancellery, Air Ministry, Foreign Ofﬁce, Ministry of Propaganda, and Gestapo headquarters, as well as to numerous railroad marshaling yards. 47The raid also killed an estimated 25,000 people.48 Against Leipzig and Dresden, the Eighth Air Force again attacked rail yards. In the attacks on Dresden on 14–15 February, clouds obscuredthe target, and crews mistakenly dumped their bombs on Dresden’smain residential district, which had been heavily bombed on the nightof 13 February by the RAF. Refugees ﬂeeing the Russians clogged the city, and between 25,000 and 35,000 civilians perished in the multiple assaults. 49 Technically, the attacks on Berlin and Dresden were aimed at military objectives. Two days after the Berlin raid, Spaatz revealed thathe had little faith in the notion that a single, massive bombing raidcould compel German surrender.

Although bombing caused many Nazi leaders great consterna- tion, the raids did not cause them to abandon the war effort. Speer later remarked that ‘Hamburg had put the fear of God in me.’ 75Joseph Goebbels, Hitler’s Minister of Propaganda, wrote on 12 March 1945:‘The air terror which rages uninterruptedly over Germanhome territory makes people thoroughly despondent.

The people will continueto do their duty and the front-line soldier will defend himself as far ashe has a possibility of doing so.’ 78In short, bombing could not remove the Nazi leadership from power. Only the German Army had the force required to decapitate the Nazi state, and most generals refused to take that action. Hitler took greatpains to cultivate the loyalty of his top commanders with an elaboratesystem of bribes that included estates in conquered territories. 79One indicator of the Fu ¨ hrer’s overwhelming support from his generals was the decision that most made, when they received orders from the 20July 1944 conspirators in Berlin as well as from Hitler’s East Prussiaheadquarters in the aftermath of the Bomb Plot, to

Spaatz’s US Strategic AirForces (USSTAF) in the United Kingdom, as well as from Arnold’s airstaff in the Pentagon. Spaatz’s ofﬁcers noted that a large portion ofthe German government had evacuated Berlin, making the operation’s ability to cause a sudden administrative breakdown problematic. Still, the daylight population of the targeted area was roughly 375,000, ofwhom 275,000 were expected to be killed or seriously injured, and ‘itmay well be that an attack on the proposed area of Berlin would havea greater effect upon national administration than is at presentappreciated’. 37Spaatz informed Allied Supreme Commander General Dwight D.

According to the Strategic Bombing Survey, a majority of Germans based their support of the war on Germany’s overall progress during the conﬂict rather than on the destruction caused by Allied air raids. Forty-four percent of those interviewed by the Survey listed ‘military factorsother than bombing’ as the main reason for declining wartime morale,while 36 percent stated that bombing was primarily responsible. 64Those numbers reﬂected the attitudes of Germans living in the Westernoccupation zones after the war. Had the Survey included inhabitants ofEast Germany, the percentage stressing ‘military factors other than bombing’ would likely have increased. The fear of Soviet Communist occupation caused most members of the German ofﬁcer corps tocontinue to back Hitler until the ﬁnal days of the Nazi regime, 65and the same can be said regarding the bulk of the German populace. Two additional factors limited airpower’s ability to affect German civilian will: the widespread degree of popular support for Hitler andNational Socialism; and the controlled nature of the Nazi state. For alarge segment of the German populace, Adolf Hitler was the messiah who had erased the humiliation of Versailles, overcome the economic 60Martin Middlebrook, The Berlin Raids (New York: Viking 1988; reprint ed.

The war, and its savagery,had gone on far too long by that point to permit less than totalcapitulation. ‘Unconditional surrender was the only option available toany 1944 regime’, contends historian Sir Max Hastings. ‘The Russians,with more than 20 million dead, wanted vengeance on an appropriately titanic scale . . . The US would have been as unwilling in 1944 as it was in 1945 to go to war with the Soviet Union for the freedom of EasternEurope.’ 83That the conspirators viewed their unfettered peace terms as viable demonstrates the depth of appeal that German nationalism stillhad for an ofﬁcer corps staring at defeat on all fronts. The example of Nazi Germany illustrates that the will of a highly nationalistic populace, intimately tied to its leadership, is exceedinglydifﬁcult to break with bombs. Germany’s ‘will to resist’ included the will of its populace as well as the will of its leaders. Both were tightly interwoven, and neither could be wrecked with airpower alone. The bulkof the German people embraced Hitler and his message with open arms,and they continued to do so long after the tide of war turned against theAxis; 84the relentless Soviet advance in the East heightened German resolve. The Gestapo and the SS further assured that the German populacewould continue to support Hitler’s war until the last shot was ﬁred. Finally, the Allied policy of unconditional surrender gave the German people no alternative to ﬁghting, and increased the apathy of those enduring the bombs. Moreover, the policy removed the key ingredientfrom bombing that allows it to be an effective instrument against anenemy nation: its ability to threaten the enemy state’s survival.Unconditional surrender guaranteed that Nazi Germany would not survive if it lost the war; both its government and it
