Tru- man claimed after the war that Marshall had estimated an inva- sion might cost five hundred thousand American lives,165 though in the 18 June 1945 meeting with the Joint Chiefs (that Arnold had missed), the president had received conflicting projections. Marshall’s calculation of thirty-one thousand casualties in the first thirty days of fighting on Kyushu was among the lowest totals, but that estimate omitted potential Navy losses and did not proj- ect when the fighting would end; Admiral William Leahy antici- pated Kyushu losses exceeding two hundred thousand.166 Ultra in- telligence intercepts in the month after the meeting indicated that triple the number of estimated Japanese troops actually defended the selected Olympic invasion beaches, and Marshall likely noti- fied Truman of the update in late July.167 The impetus to obtain a rapid, inexpensive victory—from the American perspective—led Truman to approve the atomic attacks even if his numbers were indefinite. Yet he framed the first atomic raid from a progressive perspective resembling Norstad’s and noted on 9 August that Hi- roshima was “a military base . . . because we wished in this first attack to avoid, insofar as possible, the killing of civilians.”168 Brit- ish Prime Minister Winston Churchill provided a similar progres- sive view of the atomic bomb’s utility—with questionable num-bers as a rationale—in his typically vivid prose: To quell the Japanese resistance man by man and conquer the coun- try yard by yard might well require the loss of a million American lives and half that number of British. . . .

More than 1,500 bombs and cruise missiles struck Iraqi governmental and military installations that night in a fantastic display of American military prowess. Although the raids caused few civilian casualties, they garnered widespread media atten- tion, and much of the coverage from around the globe was highly critical.44 Bush was upset that many observers failed to appreci- ate the American ability to apply lethal doses of air power pre- cisely. He later remarked that “it was not understood that the United States had found a way to wage war that as much as pos- sible spared civilians, avoided collateral damage and targeted the leaders and their means to fight and maintain power. Wars of an-nihilation, carpet-bombing, and fire-bombing of cities should be a thing of the past.” 45 twenty-First-Century dilemmas of Progressive american air Power Progressive sentiments have continued to guide America’s appli-cation of air power in both Iraq and Afghanistan, but the results have not matched the rhetoric. Both conflicts have evolved into struggles against irregular units in which ground combat has dom- inated. Enemy fighting techniques have varied from guerrilla war - fare, replete with suicide terrorism, booby traps, and roadside bombs, to occasional massed uprisings. Generally, when the en- emy chooses to fight, civilians are likely to be close at hand, which increases the chances of bombing mistakes even with the sophis-ticated technology now available in the likes of Predator drones and satellite-guided bombs. In Iraq, an estimated 1 ,560 civilian deaths resulted from air strikes between 2006 and 2008. 46 In Af- ghanistan, according to un assessments, air raids killed 116 civil- ians in 2006, 321 in 2007, and 522 in 2008.47 The trend is especially discouraging in Afghanistan, where ef-p r o g r e s s i v e  l e g a c i e s EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

Roosevelt be- lieved that memories of such destruction would help dissuade the Axis populations from pursuing future war.131 Against the Japa- nese, American airmen generally reflected the sentiments of most Americans and felt little compassion for an enemy that they in- creasingly viewed as treacherous.132 By early 1945, the American public had learned of atrocities that the Japanese had commit-ted against captured American troops in the Philippines, which heightened the hunger for revenge that had emanated from Pearl Harbor. Kamikaze attacks that began at Leyte Gulf in October 1944 also intensified the call for retribution. Arnold, who visited the Philippines in June 1945, noted in his diary: “There is no feeling of sparing any Japs here, men, women or children: gas, fire, any-thing to exterminate the entire race exemplifies the feeling.” 133 Rosy O’Donnell wrote LeMay a week after the war ended that his service in XXI Bomber Command “gave me an opportunity, not only to repay the humiliating experience which I suffered at the hands of the Japs in the early days of hostilities, but also to put in a lick for the many fine men who were not so fortunate in get- ting out of their clutches.” 134 The priority on quickly ending the war to save Allied lives meshed well with the desire for revenge.

Democrat Woodrow Wilson, the winner of the 1912 election, also considered himself a progressive, and worked hard to assure the success of the “individual entrepre-neur” against the perceived evils of “big business.” The progres- sive movement’s span across political party lines demonstrated its wide national appeal. The devastation and ugly realism of World War I ended the progressive era for most Americans; the repudiation of the Ver - sailles Treaty and Wilson’s League of Nations exemplified the pub- lic’s postwar rejection of the movement’s ideals.

Mitchell dismissed stockpiles of materiel, especially food, and he also re - jected reserves of morale. 19 He bestowed on the governments un- der attack a degree of rationality that ignored the enemy’s war aims and the possibility that the population would willingly suf-fer to avoid capitulation. His examples intimated that all indus- trial powers were alike—and that all resembled his view of the United States.

His quick tongue and steadfast beliefs prevented him from command- ing the Air Service; he had to settle for Assistant Chief, which car - ried with it a brigadier general’s rank. As such, he refused to de- fer to Major General Charles T. Menoher, a non-flying Air Service chief who had led the Forty-second “Rainbow” Division in World War I. Mitchell published his report of the Ostfriesland sinking despite Menoher’s warning not to do so. Instead of confronting Mitchell afterward, Menoher resigned his post.

Upon replacing Menoher, Patrick stated that he would be chief in deed as well as name in a remark aimed at Mitchell. When Mitch- ell responded with an offer of resignation, Patrick told him that the offer would be accepted, and Mitchell reconsidered. 9 Patrick realized his deputy’s brilliance and even came to share his views on an independent ai

Air Force Colonel “BA” Andrews, who has taught at both National War College and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, provided invaluable sug- gestions, both in terms of research and structure. Professor Peter Maslowski, who has served as my mentor since 1982 when I became one of his graduate students at the Univer - sity of Nebraska, provided continual support and a tremendous critique of an early draft of this work. I never cease to be amazed by his continued drive for excellence and his absolute commit - ment to making his students better people—in all facets of life. Pete has been my definition of the ideal teacher for as long as I have known him, and he is the example I have tried to emulate throughout my teaching career. This book would not have occurred without the guidance pro- vided by two key people in my life—my father-in-law and my fa- ther. My father-in-law, Dr. David MacIsaac, wrote the definitive study of World War II’s U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, and taught me when I was a senior cadet at the Air Force Academy—long be- fore his daughter Donna caught my eye. He was a rigid disciplinar - ian when it came to historical scholarship then, and nothing has changed in almost thirty-five years since. He read an early draft of this work and took me to task on many parts of it, and the result- ing product is far better than it would have been without his com- ments. I cannot thank him enough for his help—in this endeavor and many others—and I dedicate this book in part to him. My dad—Walter Allen Clodfelter Jr.—is a part of Ameri- ca’s greatest generation, and served in a control tower on Tin-ian during the early morning of 6 August 1945  when the Enola Gay took off on its fateful mission to Hiroshima.

As a re- sult, Lovett and others close by, including relatively junior offi- cers like Lauris Norstad, Jacob Smart, and Hoyt Vandenberg, who served on Arnold’s handpicked Advisory Council, would some-times speak on Arnold’s behalf. 18 All of them understood—and accepted—the Commanding General’s unwavering commitment to wrecking the Axis with air power—and to accomplishing that goal in such a way that air power’s contribution to victory would provide an unmistakable impetus for an independent air force. Marshall did little to curb Arnold’s zeal. After becoming Chief of Staff, Marshall had added the study of air power to the Ar - my’s Command and General Staff College curriculum.19 Following Pearl Harbor he emphasized his “desire to impress upon higher commanders especially their responsibility for taking all measures which will contribute to our control of the air.”20 Andrews’s pre- war overtures influenced Marshall’s favorable view of the Army Air Forces, but so too did a shared strategic vision with the aaf Commanding General.
