Ploesti, Regensburg, and Schweinfurt exemplified the carnage that Luftwaffe defenses inflicted on Eighth Air Force throughout the summer and early autumn of 1943. Eaker tried to offset the losses by increasing his total of bombers and crews. He possessed almost 700 bombers by July, allowing him to launch some raids with as many as 300 aircraft, but he still lacked the numbers to do so on a consistent basis, plus his crew totals remained insuffi-cient. 113 Production problems in the United States left him short 240 bombers, and the diversions that had plagued him during the spring continued. 114 At his April briefing to the Joint Chiefs, he stated that he would likely need to replace a third of his force each month because of attrition, 115 but loss rates often neared 10 percent on the missions flown against Germany in August. Losses among new crews were higher still—four new groups that arrived in April averaged a loss of 21 aircraft in eighteen missions, while four experienced groups on the same missions averaged 9.116 Eaker told Arnold that new crews needed at least two weeks of train-ing to make them mission ready and that several losses occurred because “the formations are not always flown as instructed.” Yet b r e a c h i n g  f o r t r e s s  e u r o p e EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

The balding, forty-seven-year-old Eaker was fond of late-night poker games with his staff, but to him Re- gensburg and Schweinfurt were not gambles—they were exactly the types of targets that would hurt Germany’s war-making ca-pability the most. Though a fighter pilot for most of his career, he was well-versed in the principles of high altitude, daylight, precision bombing and had graduated from the Air Corps Tacti-cal School in 1936. Hap Arnold had chosen him as coauthor for two books promoting air power during the late 1930s, plus Ar - nold had also made him Chief of Air Corps Information. With a degree in journalism from Southern Cal, a charming smile, and a tremendous ability to convey his ideas (his promotion of the Rex intercept was just one example), Eaker had been an apt choice to help carve the American public’s image of air power. Arnold believed him well suited to lead Eighth Air Force after its initial commander, Tooey Spaatz, departed England in late 1942 to take a command in North Africa.b r e a c h i n g  f o r t r e s s  e u r o p e EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

Engineers thus far had limited success de- veloping “drop tanks” to extend the American fighters’ range. At- tempts to protect bombers with the yb-40, a b-17 that carried no bombs and sported extra turrets and machine guns, failed miser - ably—the aircraft’s performance characteristics differed too much from standard bombers to keep place in formation. Eaker believed that with more bombers he could ultimately overcome the Luft-waffe, and that his bomber crews had already inflicted substan - tial losses on the German fighter force. He surmised that more bombers and larger formations offered greater firepower to shoot down German fighters. Eaker also pressed for fighter escorts, but he did not completely dismiss the yb- 40, which he thought was “a good idea but we have not quite gotten the correct aircraft for carrying it out.”119 To the pilots, navigators, bombardiers, and gunners who bat- tled the Luftwaffe, the prospects for success appeared grim in - deed.

The Luftwaffe defended tenaciously, and 75 bombers were shot down, crashed, or written off. Yet the statistic that mattered most to Spaatz was enemy losses, and his fighter pilots claimed 82 German aircraft downed for a cost of 14 American fighters.37 On 8 March the onslaught continued. Spaatz sent 600 bomb- ers and 900 fighters against Berlin, losing 13 bombers and 17 fighters. Three hundred bombers returned the next day, bombing through the clouds with h2x. Nine heavies fell to flak—but none were lost to Luftwaffe fighters, which did not oppose the attack.

The Fourth Bomb Wing would depart for Regensburg fifteen minutes before the First Wing followed it for Schweinfurt, which would prevent German fighters from attacking both formations on the way to their targets. The Regensburg mission would initially draw the Germans’ attention, and by the time the First Wing’s bombers approached Schweinfurt, the German fighters would have landed to refuel and rearm, which would allow the Schweinfurt force to proceed to its target unhindered. In the meantime, after the Fourth Wing bombed the Messerschmitt complex at Regensburg, it would avoid further combat by flying south across the Mediterranean to land in North Africa. The Schweinfurt bombers would then bat- tle the rearmed German fighters on the trip home to British bases. If everything worked as planned, the Germans would suffer ma- jor damage to two of their most important war-making facilities, and the American bombers would inflict that pain at minimal cost to the attacking force.1 Yet the plan that appeared so appealing on paper turned out to be lacking in practice. To succeed, it required near-perfect weather, crisp coordination between multiple layers of command, and zero mishaps as two large formations of heavy bombers took shape in the skies over East Anglia. Those demands were a lot to ask for from a bombing force that had never flown so far across hos-tile territory.

The defending fighters often failed to locate the bomber formations, and if they did so, it was often too late to intercept them. Major Walter H. Frank, the Tactical School’s Assistant Commandant, remarked after watching 1929 air maneuvers in Ohio: “There is considerable doubt among the umpires as to the ability of any air organization to stop a well- organized, well flown air attack.” 98 Mitchell’s former aide, Lieu- tenant Kenneth Walker, echoed this sentiment as a Bombardment instructor from 1929 to 1933, and the notion found its way into Tactical School texts. Most instructors believed that the defensive firepower of tight formations would ward off any fighters that happened to intercept a bomber attack. Still, they considered the possibility of an escort fighter that could accompany bombers to target, but dismissed the notion for two reasons: (1 ) they could not envision an aerodynamic design that successfully melded a fighter’s speed and maneuverability with a bomber’s range; and (2) money for both fighter and bomber development simply did not exist during the Depression, and fighters were not going to gain the independent victory that would lead to an autonomous air force. 99 Major Claire Chennault, who directed the Tactical School’s Pursuit section from 1934 to 1935, adamantly opposed using fighters as escorts—in his mind, their sole mission was air defense. 100 Dogmatic views also prevailed regarding anti-aircraft artillery.

The fighters that initially arrived as part of Eighth Air Force did so to protect friendly bomber airfields from German attack; awpd- 1’s designers had intended them for that purpose, not to protect bombers in flight. 28 Although Hansell and a few others argued before the war that pursuit aircraft (fighters) would prove useful as bomber escorts, their pleas fell on mostly deaf ears, and those who listened did not believe that a suitable single-seat fighter could be built with sufficient range to accompany bombers to tar - get.29 The b-17 and the b-24 (the other four-engine bomber that comprised Eighth Air Force’s “heavy” bomber force) would have to fight through the toughest German defenses alone, as would two-engine “medium” bombers such as the b-25 and b -26 that also were a part of the Eighth. Spaatz, for one, expressed little concern about the challenges ahead. One week after the Eighth Air Force’s first bombing raid of the war, a 17 August 1942 attack by 12 b-17s against a marshal- ling yard near Rouen, France, he wrote Arnold that with 1 ,500 heavy and medium bombers, plus 800 fighters to defend his air - fields, he would have “complete aerial supremacy over Germany within a year, with the resultant insurance of he

Spaatz had achieved what Eaker could not because Spaatz pos- sessed an abundance of resources that allowed him to conduct an air campaign based on attrition.41 Eaker had counted on the Luft- waffe’s aerial losses to spur his quest for air superiority as well, but anxiety about the survival of his bomber force prevented per - sistent attacks deep into Germany. Neither Eaker nor Spaatz com- pletely abandoned their progressive belief that the destruction of key targets like aircraft factories and ball bearing plants would produce rapid results; their concern was whether the results would occur rapidly enough.

Yet the cost was enormous. Eaker’s painstaking commitment of a weak bomber force that lacked escort fighters, and Spaatz’s ruthless use of the strength that he possessed, combined to make a staggering 77 per - cent of all American airmen who flew against the Third Reich be- fore D-Day casualties.42 Eaker and Spaatz had accurately surmised the importance of the German aircraft industry to Hitler’s war machine. The Luft-waffe was not going to risk losing its production centers without a fight—which was exactly what Spaatz hoped in early 1944. Be- tween January and the end of April, the Germans had 1 ,684 pi - lots killed, and Ultra intercepts made Spaatz aware of the loss.43 Eaker, who now “owned” Fifteenth Air Force as a part of his Med- iterranean Allied Air Forces (Spaatz, as usstaf Commander, di-rected the heavy

Besides inflicting substantial damage in the air, Big Week also hurt the German aircraft industry. Radar bombing occurred on few missions; crews conducted most attacks with the Norden bomb- sight.33 b-17s and b-24s dropped more than ten thousand tons of bombs during the six-day span—more tonnage than the Eighth Air Force had dropped on all targets for all of 1943.34 The attacks completely wrecked the Regensburg complex and damaged other facilities as well, but analysts’ claims that the attacks had reduced production to 650 aircraft a month were wishful thinking. In ac- tuality, the large amount of slack in the German aircraft indus-try enabled the monthly production rate to increase despite the raids; many factories with only one shift of workers changed to twenty-four-hour operations. 35 Still, Big Week stymied German production plans. Nazi economic leaders had calculated that they could produce 80, 000 aircraft a year by 1945, yet they reached only 36,000 in 1944.36 Big Week was a key reason that they could not produce more. Buoyed by Big Week’s success, Spaatz turned his attention to the target that American airmen had most wanted to bomb since their first raid over Hitler’s Europe—Berli

Unlike the dismal weather in Britain, German skies were crys- tal clear, making them ideal for bombing—and for fighter assaults against the bombers. LeMay’s b-17s formed a stream fifteen miles long at staggered intervals from sixteen thousand to twenty thou- sand feet. A Messerschmitt Me-110 quickly positioned itself along- side the formation, out of range, and relayed information to wait- ing German fighters. Colonel Beirne Lay Jr., who flew as a copilot in the bomber stream’s last squadron, later wrote: “I had the lone- some foreboding that might come to the last man about to run a gauntlet lined with spiked clubs.”5 An enormous aerial melee soon engulfed the bombers.

Hansell estimated that forty-two groups of heavy bombers, composed of 48 aircraft each and totaling 2,016 aircraft, would arrive in the United Kingdom by 1 January 1944, along with 960 medium bombers. The plan estimated 2,500 fighters as well, but did not consider them as bomber escorts. “Our heavy bombers are far superior in fire power and capacity to absorb punishment to the bombers used by the Germans,” awpd-42 observed. “Our daylight penetration of German defenses has up to this time in-dicated a relatively low attrition rate to our bombers and a rela-tively high attrition rate to German fighters.” 35 Despite awpd- 42’s optimistic appraisal, prospects for bomb- ing Germany were dim, and the Rouen raid set the pattern for the next five months of Eighth Air Force operations. Spaatz never came close to receiving the 1 ,500 bombers he had mentioned in his prediction to Arnold and was unwilling to risk his meager force against targets in Germany. President Roosevelt had spurred bomber production with his May 1941 order to build 500 “heav- ies” a month, but it took time for assembly lines to gear up for that total. By March 1942  American industry topped the 4,000 mark in monthly aircraft production, yet 40 percent were train- ers, and transport aircraft and fighters consumed a sizable chunk of the rest.36 In October, just as the Eighth Air Force had gained four more groups of heavy bombers, each containing 35 aircraft, Spaatz received word that he had to surrender 1,250 airplanes and their crews to help create Twelfth Air Force for the invasion of North Africa.37 Eighth Air Force would have only seven “heavy” groups remaining, and of those, only two were fully operational at the end of October. 38b r e a c h i n g  f o r t r e s s  e u r o p e EBSCOhost - printed on 10/13/2024 9:54 PM via .

Most bombardiers trained at “high” altitudes of twelve thousand feet, rather than at the twenty-thousand-foot level they would frequently use for com- bat.39 Gunners arrived without having fired at tow targets. Pilots arrived with no experience in formation flying, essential not only for mutual protection, but also to assure concentrated bombing patterns. Not until LeMay appeared with his 305th Bomb Group in November 1942 did Eighth Air Force truly begin to solve the problems of formation flying. After several days of directing train- ing missions from the top turret of his b-17, he devised the “com- bat box” formation that massed three squadrons of six aircraft each to form a combat group of eighteen aircraft.40 Two or more combat groups formed a combat wing. LeMay further took his best pilots, navigators, and bombar - diers, and made them “lead” crews who dictated by radio when the entire group formation dropped its bombs. Most b -17s had their bombsights removed and replaced by a machine gun in the aircraft’s Plexiglas nose. The resulting “pattern bombing” tech- nique ultimately became standard operating procedure for Eighth Air Force. “At one stroke you raised the accuracy of the whole Group from the common denominator to the level of your best man, and navigation improved accordingly,” he later remarked.41 LeMay also mandated that his crews fly “straight and level” two minutes prior to target to allow the gyro in the Norden bomb-sight to stabilize while the lead bombardier fed in ground speed and cross-wind information. Though initially apprehensive about the inability to take evasive action on the bomb run, crews found that their loss rate to German flak actually declined with a steady approach to target.

Other crews were not so fortunate. By August 1943 the life expectancy of a typical bomber crewman had dipped to fifteen missions—and would stay at that number for the remainder of the year. 120 Eaker wrote Arnold in October, “I think it is perfectly marvelous the morale we have been able to maintain,”121 but the truth was better revealed in the first stanza of a poem written by one of LeMay’s crewmen: They call him the “Aerial Gunner.” His hopes, they say, are dim And his life is said to hang by a thread That is long and weak and slim.122 The progressive tenets of the Air Corps Tactical School had forecast a bomber offensive that achieved success by minimizing crew losses instead of through attrition. Yet the longer the day-light campaign persisted, the more it resembled an aerial slugfest that would continue until only one side demonstrated that it could still respond after absorbing massive punishment. Eaker could not allow that fight to persist indefinitely, but he could see no way to avoid the slaughter in the sky given the time constraints that he faced. Indeed, based on his receipt of intercepted German mes-sage traffic, he believed that the Luftwaffe fighter force had suf- fered severe losses that threatened its ability to control the air. 123 If he could break that force through continued assaults on vital centers, then he might yet achieve daylight air superiority within the allotted time. The time available, though, continued to slip away. In mid-August, the Combined Chiefs of Staff solidified the 1 May 1944 date for the invasion of France and reaffirmed that the successful prosecution of the Combined Bomber Offensive was a prerequisite for it.b r e a c h i n g  f o r t r e s s  e u r o p e EBSCOhost - pri
