By so doing, he anticipated a debate that took place in academia when historians of the Holocaust and World War II discovered these reports in the 2000s ( Kulka & Jäckel, 2004 ). Second, one of his collaborators (or himself) felt that the reports are limited in that the Germans did not avail themselves of modern scientific techniques for the study of popular thought and feeling. Quantitative controls, sampling methods, and research design were completely lacking in the collection and interpretation of the material for those reports.17 Rensis Likert became known in the 1930s for having proposed a method of sta - tistical analysis that consists of measuring attitudes on a numbered scale. This method, commonly referred to as the Likert scale ( Likert, 1932 ), is still used today. The questions used as indicators can be closed or open-ended. In the first case, the interviewees are asked to specify their degree of agreement with a statement by choosing among the formulas “completely agree,” “rather agree,” “neither disa - gree nor agree,” “rather disagree,” and “completely disagree.” In the second case, the interviewees answer as they see fit. The analyst then assigns a code to each respondent’s answers to classify them on the scale. Likert convinced the USSBS secretariat to give him the means to carry out a large-scale survey with open-ended questions and coded answers among 3,700 German bombing survivors (and almost as many Japanese). The interviewees were asked about 50 questions on various subjects, including their reactions during and after the air raids. The interviewers were then asked to look for any sequences in the answers where the interviewees mentioned their “morale.” These indicators were then subsumed into a “morale index” which was set up as a “dependent” variable, i.e., to be explaine

The context of the interviews was not conducive to the expression of free speech. The interviewers were soldiers of an occupying army. They conducted the interviews in uniform, which could give them an air of police interrogation. Moreover, the “denazification” process had started and rumours had begun to circulate about the administration of a questionnaire that was supposed to deter - mine the degree of complicity of each individual with the Nazi regime (the future “Fragebogen zur Entnazifizierung ,” questionnaire for denazification). Although the interviewers explained the USSBS did not aim at assessing their proximity to the Nazi regime, this was far from an ideal interview situation as described in social science textbooks. The following excerpt from a “control interview” pub - lished as an appendix to the main report of the Morale Division  gives an idea of the biases induced by this method of investigation: Q: “In your opinion, what was the Allies’ objective through these raids?” (A21) A: “The Allies wanted to exhaust the population, incite them to rebel, and thus end the war. If they had not bombed the cities, the war would have lasted much longer and more men would have died at the front” Q: “Did you blame the Allies for the air raids” (A20) A: “Really not.

During his hearing in the House of Representatives during the debate over the creation of the air force, Vice Admiral Ofstie used a technique documented by sociologists of controversy (Latour, 2005 (1989 )): he opened the “black box” of the study he intended to disqualify. Without mentioning Galbraith by name, he explained that certain “civilian” members of the board did not, at first, consider validating the thesis of the effectiveness of “strategic” bombing or recommending the creation of an air force. These ideas were absent, he added, from the interim reports produced on 5 March 1946, 10 March 1946, and 1 May 1946. According to him, the USSBS secretariat had modified the text under “pressure” from supporters of the creation of an air force.15 According to David MacIsaac, this grand unpacking of a kind of inter-army war surprised some members of Congress who “complained about the damned militarists who seemed unwilling to give up their private armies” (MacIsaac, 1976 , p. 123). At the time, the Morale Division  had not produced any official and public study of its own (only internal pre-reports), not even on the German case. This came in May 1947 with the publication of the report on “The Effects of Strategic Bombing on German Morale.” The timing was particularly opportune. The US Congress was debating the bill that would lead, two months later, to the creation of the Air Force. The Morale Division  officially concludes that “strategic” bombings demoralized civilians The United Kingdom had also undertaken, in 1945, to assess the effects of “strate - gic” bombing. The summary report of this British Bombing Survey Unit  (BBSU) that began circulating in military circles in June 1946 stated that the bombing of transportation systems had had an interesting military effect, that the bombing of factories had had no measurable impact on productivity, and that the bombing of civilian morale had been a complete failure: “Insofar as the offensive against German cities

In the first draft of the summary report that they wrote, they ignored Galbraith’s “discovery” and presented the Allied air war as a success story. All USSBS directors were expected to sign the summary report on Germany prepared by Cabot and Perera. Galbraith refused to do so, arguing that it was a matter of “intellectual honesty” ( Galbraith, 1981 , p. 226). Diplomat George Ball proposed a compromise solution. The USSBS would produce not one but two synthesis reports: a relatively short “summary” report and a longer “overall” report. Both would be signed by all members of the executive team, but Galbraith would have leadership on one and the secretariat on the other. Ball added that both sides could draw on the work of the other group of USSBS scientists: the Morale Division  headed by psycho-sociologist Rensis Likert. The Morale Division  takes position against Galbraith The USSBS Morale Division  conducted an exploratory survey in February‒March 1945 among the population of the cities of Krefeld and Darmstadt, which had been bombed in June 1943 and September 1944, respectively.

As a matter of fact, the USSBS synthesis reports ‒ the only reports that had an impact on the public debate ‒ all concluded that the Allied strategic bombing was “decisive,” including those that were intended to “demoralize” the population.5 This chapter revisits this key moment in the constitution of the belief of a part of the strategic studies field in the effectiveness of strategic bombing: the production of the main USSBS reports. I show that the conclusions of the synthesis reports are indeed very favourable to strategic bombing but that they mask a dissension within the USSBS board.

He came to the conclusion that “strategic” bombing in general had been ineffective and that those directed against civilian morale had even been counterproductive because they had contributed to remobilizing the bombed people against the aggressors.6 The conclusion of the synthesis reports on the “decisive” character of “strategic” bombings in general and of those directed against the “morale” of civilians in particular is due to the marginalization of Galbraith’s minority report. The argument follows a chronological plan. Most of the discussion focuses on the production of the reports between 1945 and 1947 and the knowledge/power operations that were associated with it.

One thing is sure though: it was not  File: --- delori_memory.pdf --- Page 9 --- The memory of the Allied bombings of World War II 163 published until 1998. This left to the USSBS Morale Division  a sort of monopoly on the assessment of the effect of “strategic” bombing on civilian morale. At the end of 1945, the Morale Division  came across some documents that were, at first sight, interesting for the evaluation of the psychological effects of “strategic” bombing: the “Stimmungsberichte” (literally “mood reports”) of the German intelligence services. These confidential reports were intended to inform the Nazi authorities about the attitude of the population towards the war and the regime. They thus directly crossed the problematic of the Morale Division  of the USSBS. These documents also went against the theory of a demoralizing effect of the bombings. In essence, they explained that the population was tired of being bombed, but that allegiance to the regime remained strong and even increased when the regime managed to show that the bombs were not aimed at factories but at women and children. The USSBS records show that the Morale Division  did consult these reports but chose to ignore them for two reasons. First, Likert felt that documents of this type produced in a totalitarian context could not be taken at face value. By so doing, he anticipated

The MIMEN kept working after World War II. Besides, the supporters of strategic bombing implemented an article- and interview-based communication campaign which “persuaded the American public that creating air supremacy would be the least costly and most effective strategy in the face of a Soviet threat that the air itself helped to overstate” ( Lazarowitz, 2005 , pp. 477‒478). However, this view evolved during the mid-1960s. Michael Sherry sees Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 film, Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb , as a turning point ( Sherry, 2008 , pp. 181‒192). Of course, the critical gaze on strategic bombing only strengthened with the rise of a (sub)culture of anti-militarism after the Vietnam War. The debate on strategic bombings, then, moved from “proph - ecy to memory” ( Sherry, 2008 ), that is to say from belief in the virtues of the air weapon to sympathy for the victims. Since then, comments have ranged from characterizing the “strategic” bombings as a crime against humanity or a war crime ( Bloxham, 2006 ) to formulations suggesting, in a more euphemistic way, that this piece of the Allied war effort was not the most glorious. The development of this moral condemnation of the Allied air wars has gone along, like in Britain, with a critical assessment of their very military effects. This set of critical civil views on the Allied air war contrasts with that found in the field of Anglophone “strategic”4 expertise, and more precisely in the United States. In this field, dominated by think tanks such as the Rand Corporation, the question of the effects of the Allied air war is approached in a more nuanced manner. A distinction is made between bombings directed against civilians and those targeting factories or transport systems, and questions are asked about their respective effects.

I conclude, however, with a section pre - senting the legacy of the USSBS in US “strategic” thinking during the Cold War, a legacy that contributed to the fragmentation of memories between the field of “strategic” studies and other research fields. The initial debate on “strategic” bombings Historians have shown that a multitude of motives helped produce the Allied air war against Germany and Japan: the belief in the effectiveness of “strategic” bombing, the bureaucratic interests of the RAF and the USSAF Air Corps ( Eden, 2004 ), a logic of mimetic rivalry leading to blindness about the military meaning of one’s actions ( Zinn, 2010 ), the “technological fanaticism” of some decision- makers and military commanders ( Sherry, 2012 ), etc. Whatever the practical rea - sons, two strategic rationales contributed to giving meaning to this public action. The first was that the destruction of civilian infrastructure such as railway stations, ports, airports, and factories would lead to a collapse of war production and, in turn, to surrender. The second stated that the disorganization and terror caused by the bombing of residential areas would “demoralize” the population, leading them to revolt against their government or at least to participate less in the war effort. The former was called “precision” bombing and the latter “area” bombing. At the time, the debate on these two types of bombing was posed in different terms. In the case of “precision” bombing, the question initially raised was that of the degree of effectiveness of the bombing and the cost/benefit ratio. Indeed, it is hard to imagine that the destruction of infrastructure useful to the war effort could, in itself, have no positive effect at all. However, there were two hypotheses regarding the possible effects of “area” bombin

This trend is perceivable in the rhetoric of the history of the air war published by the official historians of the Royal Air Force in the early 1960s (Frankland & Webster, 1961 ). It sharpened following the publication of the first scientific (and critical) book on the issue ( Hastings, 1979 ). The civilian public debate on the Allied air war followed a different path in the United States. During the war, the collusion between the arm industries, the military, the propaganda services, and the cinematographic industry generated a “Military-Industrial Media-Entertainment Network” (MIMEN) which spread out the idea that strategic bombings could help to win the war at a lower eco - nomic and human cost (for Americans). For instance, “Walt Disney imagined an orgiastic destruction of Japan by the air in his 1943 animated feature Victory Through Air Power (based on Alexander P. de Seversky’s 1942 book), well before the United States could carry it out” ( Sherry, 2008 , pp. 177‒292).

In 1948, the US Air Force set up a research group on the European (mainly British) expertise on aerial “pacification” of the colonies during the interwar period. For five years, ten officers and six civilians paid by the fledgling air force sought to understand how the Royal Air Force had “pacified” Iraq, the Gulf of Aden, Palestine, Transjordan, East Africa, or the Indian subcontinent before World War II. These men reproduced what others have called the “myth of air control” ( Gray, 2001 ), i.e., the (disputed (Omissi, 1990 )) idea that punitive bombing of rebellious villages and tribes had helped Britain, France, and to a lesser extent Italy to preserve their colonial empires. This belief met the USSBS-produced belief in the “demoralizing” effects of “strategic” bombing. The synthesis between the USSBS and air control myths contributed to giving meaning, internally, to the bombing of civilians in Vietnam. Thomas Hippler notes in this regard that the war in Vietnam combined “the worst of two traditions: that of the total war between nation-states and that of the ‘small war’ of the insurrectionary or colonial type” ( Hippler, 2014 , p. 179). This tradition was also present in the US war in Laos and, to a lesser extent, in the Gulf War in 1991 ( Gentile, 2001 ), in Afghanistan in 2001, and in Iraq in 2003 ( Grosscup, 2006 ). The publication in 1998 (50 years after its production) of the critical report of the British Bombing Survey Unit contributed to weakening the Douhetian narrative within the field of “strategic” studies. Moreover, the “counter-insurgency” turn of the “war on terror” in the 2000s mechanically prompted many proponents of air power to cast some doubt on “classical,” “strategic” bombing. Indeed, the precepts of coun - terinsurgency warfare emphasize the importance of mastering violence against non- rebel populations in order to prevent them from becoming rebellious ‒ an idea that is the exact opposite

I was listening to the English radio and I knew that we had bombed cities.”18 These questions and the interview context combined to generate responses in which 68 per cent of those bombed explained that they “did not blame the Allies for the bombing” and 59 per cent had “wished” that their government would sur - render after a raid.19 The Morale Division  concluded, then, that bombing severely depressed the morale of German civilians. (…) Its main psychological effects were defeatism, fear, hopelessness, fatalism, and apa - thy. War weariness, willingness to surrender, loss of hope for German vic - tory, distrust of leaders, feelings of disunity and demoralizing fear were all more common among bombed than unbombed people.20 The report on the Japanese case appeared a month later, in June 1947. It told the same story, using the same statistical artefacts. However, it included an origi - nal argument: the idea of an indirect demoralizing effect. According to this the - ory, the drop in morale would not only be observed in the bombed areas. When the chosen targets were symbolic, as in the bombing of the Japanese capital in February‒March 1945, the psychological effect was perceptible throughout the country. Paul Nitze took up this idea in his summary report on the war in the Pacific. Major-General Lauris Norstad also stressed this point during his hearing before Congress during the debate over the creation of the US Air Force.21 The latter was officially instituted in July 1947. Some of the flying fortresses that had  File: --- delori_memory.pdf --- Page 11 --- The memory of the Allied bombings of World War II 165 bombed Germany and Japan were transferred to this new organization.

The most illustrious representative of this epistemic community is Bernard Brodie ( Brodie, 1946 ). However, these proponents of a “revolution in strategic thinking” did not totally reject the USSBS’s conclusions on the usefulness of conventional “strategic” bombing, especially those directed against the morale of populations. Brodie, for example, relied on USSBS findings to argue that the July 1943 Hamburg bombing had an impact on civilian morale throughout the country and that a repeat of this type of area bombing would have forced the Reich to surrender earlier. This idea did not completely contradict that of revolution in military affairs: for Brodie, the USSBS demonstration of the “demoralizing” effect of area bombing was also an argument in favour of his thesis of a demoralizing effect of thermonuclear bombing ( Brodie, 1959 , p. 137). Another important legacy of the USSBS can be found in the writings of soci - ologist Hans Speier, the first director of the Rand Corporation’ s social science department. In the 1950s, Speier argued that it was immoral to target German and Japanese civilians without dismissing the idea that it could have some interesting military effects. Speier overcame this potential cognitive dissonance by propos - ing a new approach to the “demoralization of civilians.” According to him, it should be possible to demoralize enemy civilian populations by employing less  File: --- delori_memory.pdf --- Page 12 --- 166 Mathias Delori violent instruments – such as propaganda ‒ or by intensifying bombing over a short period of time ( Dafinger, 2018 , 2020 b).

The investigators interviewed 200 survivors as well as various local notables. These interviews did not support the thesis of a “demoralizing” effect of the bombings on civilians. For example, a police officer named Puetz explained to investigators that “the people were dazed and depressed for about two weeks following the attack, but soon recovered and were of course very mad at the attackers. Their belief in the ultimate German victory was not affected.”9 The Morale Division  did not communicate the above data to the USSBS sec - retariat. In an undated document, probably produced in the spring of 1945, the person in charge of the survey in Krefeld and Darmstadt explained, on the con - trary, that the bombings had had an interesting strategic effect: “the desire to stop the war as a result of the bombings was reported by 58% of the inhabitants of Krefeld and 55% of the population of Darmstadt. As Darmstadt was “bombed more heavily than Krefeld, and the damage […] much greater,” it appeared, according to him, that “the most heavily bombed city suffered a greater loss of morale.”10 Perera and Cabot relied on the pre-reports of Morale Division  to marginalize Galbraith’s critical theses. In practice, they let the economist produce his special - ized report11 but they took control of the key sections of both the “summary” and the “overall” report: the abstract, the introduction, and the conclusion. These sec - tions contain the idea that has marked the post-war field of “strategic” studies, i.e., that “strategic” bombings played a “decisive” role in defeating Germany. Both synthesis reports remain vague concerning the effects on German war production.

The people lost faith in the prospect of victory, in their leaders, and in the promises and propa - ganda to which they were subjected. Most of all, they wanted the war to end. They resorted increasingly to “black radio” listening, to circulation of rumor and fact in opposition to the Regime; and there was some increase in active political dissidence ‒ in 1944 one German in every thousand was arrested for a political offense. If they had been at liberty to vote themselves out of the war, they would have done so well before the final surrender.12 The synthesis reports were presented to the press on 30 September 1945, six weeks after the surrender of Japan. In the euphoria of victory, the mainstream press only retained the paragraphs validating without nuance the thesis of the effectiveness of “strategic” bombing: “air power defeated Reich, d’Olier concludes” (Philadelphia Enquirer); “Civilian study concludes bombers defeated Germany” (Washington Times-Herald); “Strategic bombing of Germany is touted as decisive to victory” (New York Tribune); “they missed the barrel but crushed Hitler” (Philadelphia record editorial) ( MacIsaac, 1976 , p. 144). The bombed Japanese are unable to continue the war The American public hardly heard about the disagreements between Galbraith and the other members of the board concerning the effects of “strategic” bomb - ings on Germany. However, the debate concerning Japan turned into an open con - troversy. The US Navy, which had played a major role in the war in the Pacific, was given the direction of a new division within the USSBS: the Naval Analysis Division . Its head, Vice Admiral Ralph A. Ofstie, requested that the summary report emphasize the contribution of naval forces but also of the two atomic bombs. While this last request may have reflected his sincere conviction of the decisive role

However, it would be wrong to think that US “strategic” studies have definitively buried the USSBS. In 2008, a Rand Corporation expert wrote, for example, that some of the USSBS’s theses may be debatable, but that no expert questions its major conclusion that “strategic” bombing made a “decisive” contribution to the victory over Germany and Japan. This, she wrote, “has stood the test of time.”24 If that is true, the horizontal fragmentation of civilian and “strategic” memories of the Allied air war may not be quite over.

While this last request may have reflected his sincere conviction of the decisive role played by these bombs, one cannot exclude that it was underpinned, once again, by a bureaucratic interest. Indeed, the US Navy was radically opposed to the project of creating an independent air force, arguing that one does not need such a force ‒ and its thousands of flying fortresses ‒ to wage war with atomic bombs. A few planes launched from an aircraft carrier can suffice. Vice Admiral Ofstie expressed this opinion internally while other sailors spoke publicly to criti - cize “strategic” bombing ( Dickens, 1947 ). In this context, the “air force supporters” relied, once again, on the analyses of the Morale Division . In his pre-reports of early 1946, Likert hammered home the idea that the bombing of Tokyo in February‒March 1945 had had a devastat - ing effect on Japanese morale, rendering them “incapable of continuing the war.” Paul Nitze, the main author of the summary report on Japan, recycled this idea to establish the central thesis of the report:  File: --- delori_memory.pdf --- Page 8 --- 162 Mathias Delori Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts, and supported by the testi - mony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey’s opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.13 Moreover, the summary report  explicitly called for the creation of an independent air force.14 This text outraged the senior officers of the Navy. During his hearing in the House of Representatives during the debate over the creation of the air force, Vice Admiral Ofstie used a technique documented by sociologists of controversy (Latour, 20

The USSBS produced about 200 reports on Germany and almost as many on Japan. Although the USSBS was officially an “independent and scientific” study, it is important to highlight that a particular interest weighed on the decision to launch the study and the production of the reports. At that time, the United States did not have an air force. The majority of US “strategic” bombing had been carried out by Army air forces grouped in what was called the “Air Corps.” Senior Air Corps officers were eager to become autonomous from their parent organization, the Army. They hoped for the creation, after the war, of an independent air force similar to the British Royal Air Force. They were supported in this endeavour by the industries who produced the flying fortresses, notably Boeing and the Douglas Aircraft Company. For these companies, the creation of an air force with strate - gic forces appeared to be the condition for the perpetuation of contracts with the War Ministry after the end of hostilities. These airmen and industrialists formed an alliance in 1944 to convince the War Department and President Roosevelt to launch an evaluation of strategic bombing, the results of which they hoped to control in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of such bombing. Hence, “Senior air officers had spent the preceding seven months establishing the survey’s scope, framing its questions, and building an organizational framework that reflected the AAF’s conceptual approach to strategic bombing” ( Gentile, 2001 , p. 50). These airmen and industrialists formalized their lobbying activities in 1946 in a network hosted by the Douglas Aircraft Company: the “Rand Project,” the ancestor of the Rand Corporation created in the wake of the USSBS in 1948 ( Dafinger, 2018 ). As a matter of fact, the USSBS synthesis reports ‒ the only reports that had an impact on the public debate ‒ all concluded that the Allied strategic bombi
