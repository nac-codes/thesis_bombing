According to an investigation conducted by the US government in 1945, “about one third of the houses of the city were destroyed and German estimates show 60,000 to 100,000 people killed.”2 This quantitative depiction of the bombing does not give an accu - rate picture of how the population of Hamburg experienced the event. The blow caused by the firestorm caused the asphyxiation of thousands of people who had taken refuge in air raid shelters whilst others died in the Elbe river after having thought that it would save them from the fires. The bombing of Hamburg is only one segment of the air war that the Allies conducted against Germany and Japan. This air war caused about ten times more civilian deaths than the German and Japanese “strategic”3 bombings. Nowadays, most historians think that it had no significant effect on the course of the war ( Kershaw, 2011 ; Overy, 2013 ). The civilian social memories of the Allied airwars in Germany and Japan have varied in space and time. However, generally speaking, they have become critical, and thus both from a normative and military perspective. This was rapidly the case in Germany ( Friedrich, 2003 ; Sebald, 2004 (2001 )) and Japan ( Yoneyama, 1999 ), but it is also true for the countries that conducted this policy of massive bombing of civilian targets and people. In the United Kingdom, a moral and strategic cri - tique of these bombings emerged as early as 1941 thanks to the Committee for the Abolition of Night Bombing , which became the Restriction Bombing Committee a year later. The activities of this organization, as well as the stances taken by pacifist intellectuals such as Vera Brittain, were strengthened after the terrible bombings of Hamburg (July 1943) and Dresden (February 1945) ( Overy, 2016 ).

They immediately infused a multitude of key texts in American strategic thinking. The first and most influential is the infamous NSC-68, written by Paul Nitze and sub - mitted to President Truman two months before the outbreak of the Korean War. This document called for a drastic increase in US military capabilities in all areas, starting with strategic air forces. One year later, while US flying fortresses were bombing Korean cities and villages, another report produced by the Air Force used the conclusions of the USSBS summary reports to justify its demands for the consolidation of its strategic forces ( Irving, 1951 ). In 1953, the Stanford Research Institute submitted another voluminous report to the US government on the les - sons to be learned from the strategic bombings of World War II for the prepara - tion of the US defence system. The text was mainly based on the “canonical” texts of the USSBS, i.e., the three synthesis reports. The Stanford researchers concluded, on this basis, that both precision and area bombing produced interest - ing militarily effects.23 This tradition seemed to run out of steam in the mid-1950s when the Soviet Union began to produce its arsenal of thermonuclear bombs and proved, particu - larly following the successful launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957, that it could strike directly at the territory of the United States. A second tradition then took off. Its leitmotiv was that the entry into the “nuclear age” made conventional strategic bombing partially obsolete. The most illustrious representative of this epistemic community is Bernard Brodie ( Brodie, 1946 ). However, these proponents of a “revolution in strategic thinking” did not totally r

While there is no shortage of criticism, particularly among defence intellectuals close to the Navy and the Army ( Andrews, 1950 ; Copeland, 2017 ; Gentile, 2001 ), there is also an articulate discourse validating the thesis of the effectiveness of the Allied air war, including the controversial “area” bomb - ings directed against civilians. The supporters of these bombings are sometimes called the “Douhetians” in reference to Giulio Douhet, the Italian officer who prophesied during the interwar period that “By bombing the most vital civilian centres it could spread terror through the nation and quickly break down B’s mate - rial and moral resistance” ( Douhet, 1942  (1921) p. 37). It is difficult to measure  File: --- delori_memory.pdf --- Page 3 --- The memory of the Allied bombings of World War II 157 precisely the weight of Douhetian thought in the American military field after World War II. We do know, however, that it was sufficiently important until the 1990s to give meaning, internally, to the carpet-bombing of Korea, Vietnam, and Laos ( Dafinger, 2020 a; Gibson, 1986 ) and, to a lesser extent, to the bombing of Iraqi cities during the first Gulf War ( Gentile, 2001 ). A specific vector of memory ( Rousso, 1990 ) played an important role in the social construction of this spectacular case of horizontal fragmentation of memo - ries: the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS). The USSBS is an expertise launched at the end of World War II by President Roosevelt to under - stand the effects of the Allied air war. For several months, some 300 civilians, 350 military officers, and 500 soldiers stayed in Germany and Japan in order to gather empirical material concerning the effects of strategic bombings.

More generally, the German people did not revolt against the Nazi regime, and the workers seemed to have gone to the factory with the same fervour until the very end. The Japanese case was different in that the war had been fought primarily from the air. However, capitulation did not come after the conventional bombings of Tokyo in February 1945 but on September 2, i.e., after the USSR entered the war against Japan (9 August 1945) and the two atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (6 and 9 August 1945). The discovery of the increase in German war production Since the US air forces engaged in Europe had mainly carried out “precision” bombing against civilian infrastructure, the “airmen” and the Rand Project had high expectations for the report of the Overall Economic Effects Division  headed by John K. Galbraith. In the absence of convincing documents, the work of Galbraith and his team stalled until May 1945 when Galbraith had the oppor - tunity to interview a key witness: Albert Speer. Speer’s testimony is obviously situated, but as Minister of Armaments (February 1942–May 1945), he was able to observe firsthand the effects of the bombings on workers and the economy. Besides, he gave Galbraith a document that summarized the evolution of German war production during the war: the “Wagenführ” report, named after its author, Rolf Wagenführ.7 This report showed that “in two and a half years, Germany’s military production of aircraft, armaments and munitions more than tripled, and even increased six times as far as tanks were concerned,” and that it only col - lapsed in the autumn of 1944, at the time of the conquest of the Reich’s vassal territories by Allied ground forces.8 Galbraith told the other members of the management team about this “discov - ery.” The latter caused outrage among the partisans of strategic bombings. In his memoirs, Galbraith mentions the case of Orvil Anderson, the USSBS military advisor: On the evening when we first discussed these

However, there were two hypotheses regarding the possible effects of “area” bombing on civilian “morale”: a strategi - cally interesting effect, and a counterproductive effect. In 1943, the US Air Force Command had asked historians to produce an expertise on the effects of Allied “strategic” bombing. The group included Carl L. Becker (Cornell University), Henry S. Commager (Columbia University), Edward Mead Earle (Princeton University), Louis Gottschalk and Bernadotte Schmitt (University of Chicago), and Dumas Malone (Harvard University). They concluded that both effects cancel each other out. In their view, it could happen that a person who saw their child  File: --- delori_memory.pdf --- Page 5 --- The memory of the Allied bombings of World War II 159 die before their eyes might feel so “demoralized” that they would no longer par - ticipate in war effort. However, the opposite effect ‒ that of radicalization against the “air terrorists”‒- also existed. Therefore, these historians wrote that “there is no evidence that the British and American bombing of German cities actually weakened the hold of the Nazi government on the German population” ( Gentile, 2001 , p. 30). In 1945, the general data on the outcome of the war against Germany and Japan made it impossible to determine whether each sort of “strategic” bomb - ing had been effective, ineffective, or counterproductive. In the case of Germany, the destruction of numerous civilian infrastructures (factories, train stations and entire cities) suggested that the extraordinary Allied firepower had contributed to the victory. However, Germany’s capitulation came after the capture of Berlin by Soviet ground forces. More generally, the German people did not revolt against the Nazi regime, and the workers seemed to have gone to the factory with the same fervour until the very end. The Japanese case was di

The USSBS produced about 200 reports on Germany and almost as many on Japan. Although the USSBS was officially an “independent and scientific” study, it is important to highlight that a particular interest weighed on the decision to launch the study and the production of the reports. At that time, the United States did not have an air force. The majority of US “strategic” bombing had been carried out by Army air forces grouped in what was called the “Air Corps.” Senior Air Corps officers were eager to become autonomous from their parent organization, the Army. They hoped for the creation, after the war, of an independent air force similar to the British Royal Air Force. They were supported in this endeavour by the industries who produced the flying fortresses, notably Boeing and the Douglas Aircraft Company. For these companies, the creation of an air force with strate - gic forces appeared to be the condition for the perpetuation of contracts with the War Ministry after the end of hostilities. These airmen and industrialists formed an alliance in 1944 to convince the War Department and President Roosevelt to launch an evaluation of strategic bombing, the results of which they hoped to control in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of such bombing. Hence, “Senior air officers had spent the preceding seven months establishing the survey’s scope, framing its questions, and building an organizational framework that reflected the AAF’s conceptual approach to strategic bombing” ( Gentile, 2001 , p. 50). These airmen and industrialists formalized their lobbying activities in 1946 in a network hosted by the Douglas Aircraft Company: the “Rand Project,” the ancestor of the Rand Corporation created in the wake of the USSBS in 1948 ( Dafinger, 2018 ).

While this last request may have reflected his sincere conviction of the decisive role played by these bombs, one cannot exclude that it was underpinned, once again, by a bureaucratic interest. Indeed, the US Navy was radically opposed to the project of creating an independent air force, arguing that one does not need such a force ‒ and its thousands of flying fortresses ‒ to wage war with atomic bombs. A few planes launched from an aircraft carrier can suffice. Vice Admiral Ofstie expressed this opinion internally while other sailors spoke publicly to criti - cize “strategic” bombing ( Dickens, 1947 ). In this context, the “air force supporters” relied, once again, on the analyses of the Morale Division . In his pre-reports of early 1946, Likert hammered home the idea that the bombing of Tokyo in February‒March 1945 had had a devastat - ing effect on Japanese morale, rendering them “incapable of continuing the war.” Paul Nitze, the main author of the summary report on Japan, recycled this idea to establish the central thesis of the report:  File: --- delori_memory.pdf --- Page 8 --- 162 Mathias Delori Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts, and supported by the testi - mony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey’s opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated.13 Moreover, the summary report  explicitly called for the creation of an independent air force.14 This text outraged the senior officers of the Navy. During his hearing in the House of Representatives during the debate over the creation of the air force, Vice Admiral Ofstie used a technique documented by sociologists of controversy (Latour, 20

However, it would be wrong to think that US “strategic” studies have definitively buried the USSBS. In 2008, a Rand Corporation expert wrote, for example, that some of the USSBS’s theses may be debatable, but that no expert questions its major conclusion that “strategic” bombing made a “decisive” contribution to the victory over Germany and Japan. This, she wrote, “has stood the test of time.”24 If that is true, the horizontal fragmentation of civilian and “strategic” memories of the Allied air war may not be quite over.

If they had been at liberty to vote themselves out of the war, they would have done so well before the final surrender.12 The synthesis reports were presented to the press on 30 September 1945, six weeks after the surrender of Japan. In the euphoria of victory, the mainstream press only retained the paragraphs validating without nuance the thesis of the effectiveness of “strategic” bombing: “air power defeated Reich, d’Olier concludes” (Philadelphia Enquirer); “Civilian study concludes bombers defeated Germany” (Washington Times-Herald); “Strategic bombing of Germany is touted as decisive to victory” (New York Tribune); “they missed the barrel but crushed Hitler” (Philadelphia record editorial) ( MacIsaac, 1976 , p. 144).

The investigators interviewed 200 survivors as well as various local notables. These interviews did not support the thesis of a “demoralizing” effect of the bombings on civilians. For example, a police officer named Puetz explained to investigators that “the people were dazed and depressed for about two weeks following the attack, but soon recovered and were of course very mad at the attackers. Their belief in the ultimate German victory was not affected.”9 The Morale Division  did not communicate the above data to the USSBS sec - retariat. In an undated document, probably produced in the spring of 1945, the person in charge of the survey in Krefeld and Darmstadt explained, on the con - trary, that the bombings had had an interesting strategic effect: “the desire to stop the war as a result of the bombings was reported by 58% of the inhabitants of Krefeld and 55% of the population of Darmstadt. As Darmstadt was “bombed more heavily than Krefeld, and the damage […] much greater,” it appeared, according to him, that “the most heavily bombed city suffered a greater loss of morale.”10 Perera and Cabot relied on the pre-reports of Morale Division  to marginalize Galbraith’s critical theses. In practice, they let the economist produce his special - ized report11 but they took control of the key sections of both the “summary” and the “overall” report: the abstract, the introduction, and the conclusion. These sec - tions contain the idea that has marked the post-war field of “strategic” studies, i.e., that “strategic” bombings played a “decisive” role in defeating Germany.

The most illustrious representative of this epistemic community is Bernard Brodie ( Brodie, 1946 ). However, these proponents of a “revolution in strategic thinking” did not totally reject the USSBS’s conclusions on the usefulness of conventional “strategic” bombing, especially those directed against the morale of populations. Brodie, for example, relied on USSBS findings to argue that the July 1943 Hamburg bombing had an impact on civilian morale throughout the country and that a repeat of this type of area bombing would have forced the Reich to surrender earlier. This idea did not completely contradict that of revolution in military affairs: for Brodie, the USSBS demonstration of the “demoralizing” effect of area bombing was also an argument in favour of his thesis of a demoralizing effect of thermonuclear bombing ( Brodie, 1959 , p. 137). Another important legacy of the USSBS can be found in the writings of soci - ologist Hans Speier, the first director of the Rand Corporation’ s social science department. In the 1950s, Speier argued that it was immoral to target German and Japanese civilians without dismissing the idea that it could have some interesting military effects. Speier overcame this potential cognitive dissonance by propos - ing a new approach to the “demoralization of civilians.” According to him, it should be possible to demoralize enemy civilian populations by employing less  File: --- delori_memory.pdf --- Page 12 --- 166 Mathias Delori violent instruments – such as propaganda ‒ or by intensifying bombing over a short period of time ( Dafinger, 2018 , 2020 b). The notion of “psychological war - fare” comes directly from this translation work. The main legacy of the USSBS, however, lies elsewhere: in the thinking (and practice) of warfare against groups or states of the Global South. In 1948, the US Air Force set up a research group on the European (mainly British) expertise on aerial “pacification” of the colonies during the interw

I was listening to the English radio and I knew that we had bombed cities.”18 These questions and the interview context combined to generate responses in which 68 per cent of those bombed explained that they “did not blame the Allies for the bombing” and 59 per cent had “wished” that their government would sur - render after a raid.19 The Morale Division  concluded, then, that bombing severely depressed the morale of German civilians. (…) Its main psychological effects were defeatism, fear, hopelessness, fatalism, and apa - thy. War weariness, willingness to surrender, loss of hope for German vic - tory, distrust of leaders, feelings of disunity and demoralizing fear were all more common among bombed than unbombed people.20 The report on the Japanese case appeared a month later, in June 1947. It told the same story, using the same statistical artefacts. However, it included an origi - nal argument: the idea of an indirect demoralizing effect. According to this the - ory, the drop in morale would not only be observed in the bombed areas. When the chosen targets were symbolic, as in the bombing of the Japanese capital in February‒March 1945, the psychological effect was perceptible throughout the country. Paul Nitze took up this idea in his summary report on the war in the Pacific.

In 1948, the US Air Force set up a research group on the European (mainly British) expertise on aerial “pacification” of the colonies during the interwar period. For five years, ten officers and six civilians paid by the fledgling air force sought to understand how the Royal Air Force had “pacified” Iraq, the Gulf of Aden, Palestine, Transjordan, East Africa, or the Indian subcontinent before World War II. These men reproduced what others have called the “myth of air control” ( Gray, 2001 ), i.e., the (disputed (Omissi, 1990 )) idea that punitive bombing of rebellious villages and tribes had helped Britain, France, and to a lesser extent Italy to preserve their colonial empires. This belief met the USSBS-produced belief in the “demoralizing” effects of “strategic” bombing. The synthesis between the USSBS and air control myths contributed to giving meaning, internally, to the bombing of civilians in Vietnam. Thomas Hippler notes in this regard that the war in Vietnam combined “the worst of two traditions: that of the total war between nation-states and that of the ‘small war’ of the insurrectionary or colonial type” ( Hippler, 2014 , p. 179). This tradition was also present in the US war in Laos and, to a lesser extent, in the Gulf War in 1991 ( Gentile, 2001 ), in Afghanistan in 2001, and in Iraq in 2003 ( Grosscup, 2006 ). The publication in 1998 (50 years after its production) of the critical report of the British Bombing Survey Unit contributed to weakening the Douhetian narrative within the field of “strategic” studies. Moreover, the “counter-insurgency” turn of the “war on terror” in the 2000s mechanically prompted many proponents of air power to cast some doubt on “classical,” “strategic” bombing. Indeed, the precepts of coun - terinsurgency warfare emphasize the importance of mastering violence against non- rebel populations in order to prevent them from becoming rebellious ‒ an idea that is the exact opposite

This was obviously a minority voice, but the small controversy over the meaning of this air war, particularly the so-called “area” raids on city centres and civil - ians, was significant enough to prompt the British authorities not to highlight this aspect of the war during the victory celebrations in July 1945 ( Knapp, 2016 ).

This trend is perceivable in the rhetoric of the history of the air war published by the official historians of the Royal Air Force in the early 1960s (Frankland & Webster, 1961 ). It sharpened following the publication of the first scientific (and critical) book on the issue ( Hastings, 1979 ). The civilian public debate on the Allied air war followed a different path in the United States. During the war, the collusion between the arm industries, the military, the propaganda services, and the cinematographic industry generated a “Military-Industrial Media-Entertainment Network” (MIMEN) which spread out the idea that strategic bombings could help to win the war at a lower eco - nomic and human cost (for Americans). For instance, “Walt Disney imagined an orgiastic destruction of Japan by the air in his 1943 animated feature Victory Through Air Power (based on Alexander P. de Seversky’s 1942 book), well before the United States could carry it out” ( Sherry, 2008 , pp. 177‒292). The MIMEN kept working after World War II. Besides, the supporters of strategic bombing implemented an article- and intervie

Most of the discussion focuses on the production of the reports between 1945 and 1947 and the knowledge/power operations that were associated with it. I conclude, however, with a section pre - senting the legacy of the USSBS in US “strategic” thinking during the Cold War, a legacy that contributed to the fragmentation of memories between the field of “strategic” studies and other research fields. The initial debate on “strategic” bombings Historians have shown that a multitude of motives helped produce the Allied air war against Germany and Japan: the belief in the effectiveness of “strategic” bombing, the bureaucratic interests of the RAF and the USSAF Air Corps ( Eden, 2004 ), a logic of mimetic rivalry leading to blindness about the military meaning of one’s actions ( Zinn, 2010 ), the “technological fanaticism” of some decision- makers and military commanders ( Sherry, 2012 ), etc. Whatever the practical rea - sons, two strategic rationales contributed to giving meaning to this public action. The first was that the destruction of civilian infrastructure such as railway stations, ports, airports, and factories would lead to a collapse of war production and, in turn, to surrender. The second stated that the disorganization and terror caused by the bombing of residential areas would “demoralize” the population, leading them to revolt against their government or at least to participate less in the war effort. The former was called “precision” bombing and the latter “area” bombing. At the time, the debate on these two types of bombing was posed in different terms. In the case of “precision” bombing, the question initially raised was that of the degree of effectiveness of the bombing and the cost/benefit ratio. Indeed, it is hard to imagine that the destruction of infrastructure useful to the war effort could, in itself, have no positive effect at all. However, there were two hypotheses regarding the possible effects of “area” bombin

The MIMEN kept working after World War II. Besides, the supporters of strategic bombing implemented an article- and interview-based communication campaign which “persuaded the American public that creating air supremacy would be the least costly and most effective strategy in the face of a Soviet threat that the air itself helped to overstate” ( Lazarowitz, 2005 , pp. 477‒478). However, this view evolved during the mid-1960s. Michael Sherry sees Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 film, Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb , as a turning point ( Sherry, 2008 , pp. 181‒192). Of course, the critical gaze on strategic bombing only strengthened with the rise of a (sub)culture of anti-militarism after the Vietnam War. The debate on strategic bombings, then, moved from “proph - ecy to memory” ( Sherry, 2008 ), that is to say from belief in the virtues of the air weapon to sympathy for the victims. Since then, comments have ranged from characterizing the “strategic” bombings as a crime against humanity or a war crime ( Bloxham, 2006 ) to formulations suggesting, in a more euphemistic way, that this piece of the Allied war effort was not the most glorious. The development of this moral condemnation of the Allied air wars has gone along, like in Britain, with a critical assessment of their very military effects. This set of critical civil views on the Allied air war contrasts with that found in the field of Anglophone “strategic”4 expertise, and more precisely in the United States. In this field, dominated by think tanks such as the Rand Corporation, the question of the effects of the Allied air war is approached in a more nuanced manner. A distinction is made between bombings directed against civilians and those targeting factories or transport systems, and questions are asked about their respective effects.

Andrew Knapp favours the first thesis without excluding the second ( Knapp, 2013 , 2016 ). One thing is sure though: it was not  File: --- delori_memory.pdf --- Page 9 --- The memory of the Allied bombings of World War II 163 published until 1998. This left to the USSBS Morale Division  a sort of monopoly on the assessment of the effect of “strategic” bombing on civilian morale. At the end of 1945, the Morale Division  came across some documents that were, at first sight, interesting for the evaluation of the psychological effects of “strategic” bombing: the “Stimmungsberichte” (literally “mood reports”) of the German intelligence services. These confidential reports were intended to inform the Nazi authorities about the attitude of the population towards the war and the regime. They thus directly crossed the problematic of the Morale Division  of the USSBS. These documents also went against the theory of a demoralizing effect of the bombings. In essence, they explained that the population was tired of being bombed, but that allegiance to the regime remained strong and even increased when the regime managed to show that the bombs were not aimed at factories but at women and children. The USSBS records show that the Morale Division  did consult these reports but chose to ignore them for two reasons. First, Likert felt that documents of this type produced in a totalitarian context could not be taken at face value. By so doing, he anticipated
