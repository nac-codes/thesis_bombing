A new kind of professionalism began to develop among regular officers: without ceasing to be heroic leaders they had to learn, in addition, to be managers and engineers. This change of style was accomplished without too much difficulty in France, where the officer corps had been ever  108 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE WARS OF THE NATIONS since the Revolution a largely middle-class institution. In the Habsburg Empire the aristocracy had always been flexible and eclectic. In Russia there was never any question of the nobility finding enough officers for the army, which was very largely led by the middle- and lower-middle-class products of cadet training schools known as junkers. But in Germany the situation was far less flexible. There, as we have seen, the officer-corps and the monarchy stood in a peculiarly intimate relationship of reciprocal loyalty : the officers swore allegiance to their War Lord and expected confirmation of their privileges in return. As the century entered its troubled middle years, the Prussian officer corps saw itself as the defenders not only of the monarchy against its external adversaries but of the social order against internal forces of disruption. Although they recognized the military necessity for the expansion of the army pressed on them by the General Staff, their leaders viewed with appre- hension a process which threatened to swamp their officers' messes with middle-class parvenus from liberal backgrounds, and to fill the ranks with young men infected by socialistic ideas. They need not have worried. The middle-class radicals of the 1820s and 3os who carried on the intellectual and political ferment of the Erhebungszeit were certainly revolutionary in 1848, and continued to

In their activities, either in war or in peace, the rest of the community took little interest, and was not encouraged to do so. Even in England, where popular support was as great as anywhere for wars, especially maritime wars, which en- riched the community and involved only a minute proportion of the population, Laurence Sterne could get as far as Paris on 73 his Sentimental Journey before anyone reminded him that, since Britain and France were at war, he ought to equip him- self with a passport. On the Continent commerce, travel, cultural and learned intercourse went on in wartime almost unhindered. The wars were the king's wars. The rôle of the good citizen was to pay his taxes, and sound political economy dictated that he should be left alone to make the money out of which to pay those taxes. He was required neither to partici- pate in making the decision out of which wars arose nor to take part in them once they broke out, unless prompted by a spirit of youthful adventure. These matters were arcana regni, the concern of the sovereign alone. It might be suggested that it was not the least achievement of European civilization to have reduced the wolf packs which had preyed on the defenceless peoples of Europe for so many centuries to the condition of trained and obedient gun dogs- almost, in some cases, performing poodles. Yet this very success bred a reaction. As the wealth of Europe developed, so did the prosperity and self-confidence of a bourgeoisie which regarded this military element in their societies, with its aristocratic officers and outcast soldiery, with a total lack of sympathy : at best as a group of specialists whose affairs were no concern of theirs, at worst as an object of derision and contempt.

The concept of discipline has become so much a part of our idea of military life that it is hard for us to realize what a new phenomenon it was in European warfare in the seventeenth century. Feudal men-at-arms were totally, gloriously undisciplined; so were the landsknechte and the tercios, men who simply arrived with their tools and did their job and who regarded one another very much as equals, distinguished by function but not by status. Discipline was not a welcome concept: in spite of their pay, the rate of desertion from the armies employed by the United Provinces was high. Nor was it an entirely original one. In the same way as Maurice, like so many other cultivated soldiers of his age, scanned the military textbooks of antiquity, especially the frequently reprinted works of Aelian and Vegetius, for ideas about the organization and deployment of 57 armies derived from the Greeks and the Romans, so did his more scholarly associates (particularly Justus Lipsius of the University of Leyden) rediscover those Stoic philosophers whose teaching about self-control, self-abnegation, and sub- mission to authority provided the necessary counterpart to the mechanism of Roman military models, the spirit of which alone would make them work. This stoical philosophy of self- sacrifice and obedience harmonized well with the sober life- style of Protestantism. It proved more acceptable, not only to the Dutch, but to the Swedes, the Scots, the Brandenburgers, and not least the troopers of the New Model Army in England, than it did to Spaniards, and French and Italians among whom individualism, sense of honour, love of panache, and quest for glory continued to play a very dominant rôle. Although Maurice and his colleagues studied and discussed all these questions, practised the formations, drilled the troops, and actually founded a military academy at Siegen where Protestant noblesse could be educated in the new doctrines, the infrequency of pitched battles gave l

Nevertheless the experience of the two World Wars-not least, the experience of historians who had taken part in them- had gradually made clear how sterile such a separation was for specialists and generalists alike. For the specialist, to abstract the conduct of war from the environment in which it was fought-social, cultural, political, economic-was to ignore dimensions essential to its understanding. For the generalist, it was impossible to understand how societies had developed without understanding how the warfare in which most of them continuously engaged had shaped their economies, their political framework, and often their entire culture. My initial object in writing this book-and of the publishers in commissioning it-was simply to provide a brief guide to the development of European warfare.

Barbarous as these foreigners were, the Italians sometimes found that as employees they had advantages over their own warriors who were liable, not simply to cheat their employers, but to take over political power. But by the end of the fourteenth century the foreigners had become absorbed into the local aristocracy, or had gone home, or were dead, and the 'condottieri' had become institu- tionalized. 'Condottieri' means simply 'contractors', being so called after the condotta which was their contract of service specifying  WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY 26 THE WARS OF THE MERCENARIES the size of the force to be provided, the length of time it was to serve, and the scale on which it was to be paid. They came in all shapes and sizes, from the leaders of small bands to great nobles like the Gonzagas, the Este, or the Colonnas, who took their rewards in lands or fiefs. Some established themselves, as did Frederick of Montefeltro at Urbino, as independent princes with whom any contract was virtually a treaty between sovereign powers. Others either became politically dominant in the states which employed them, as did the Visconti and the Sforzas in Milan, or became their permanent professional advisers on defence and the commanders and trainers of the citizen levies. The forces provided by the condottieri were predominantly mounted; that is, they consisted of 'lances' of at least one armoured man-at-arms with his train of attendant squire, page, and foot soldiers armed with spear or cross-bow, or, by the end of the fifteenth century, arquebus. The conduct of battle, especially in the hands of experts like Andrea Braccio and Francesco Sforza, became a subtle affair of feints and surprises, of forces held in reserve until the decisive moment, of manoeuvre as well as shock. Tactics and strategy became something of an art form. But their employers, having paid good money, demanded decisive results of a kind that the condottie

This phase of what was later to be termed 'The War Against Terror' may be said to have opened when in 1979 the American-sponsored regime of the Shah of Iran was overthrown and an Islamic Republic established under the clerical dictatorship of the Ayatollah Khomeini; who thereupon summoned the entire Muslim world to join him in purifying Islam from the influence of the United States, 'the Great Satan'. In consequence the United States did little to prevent Iran's neighbour and rival Iraq, under its secularist leader Saddam Hussein, from invading Iranian territory and starting a war that lasted a decade. Saddam went on to claim possession of his oil-rich neighbour Kuwait, which he invaded and occupied in 1989. But he chose his moment badly. A few months earlier the collapse of the Soviet Union had restored the effectiveness of the United Nations, so the United States was able to assemble a coalition that for the first time since the Korean war could put into effect the principle of 'collective security'. In a lightning campaign American-led forces expelled the Iraqi army from Kuwaiti territory. But they were restrained by their Arab allies from pressing their advantage any further, and Saddam remained in power in Baghdad. This intensification of American presence in the region further infuriated Islamic extremists throughout the Middle East. It was an ayatollah from America's most loyal ally in the region Saudi Arabia, Osama bin Laden, 143 who issued a fatwah calling on the youth of the entire Islamic world to take arms against the United States and Israel to expel them from 'the sanctuaries of Islam'.

As the soldier had to provide his own arms and equipment the utterly indigent were excluded; but once enrolled, the prospects before a tough, ambitious, and unscrupulous young man of moving upwards in the social lad- der were very fair. Pay was erratic; but if he survived diseases and battle, was not robbed by his colleagues, and did not drink or gamble his fortune away, then loot, ransom, and booty might provide him with the capital needed to set up business on his own account. This anyhow was the prospect which lured men into becom- ing soldiers-a trade which by the end of the sixteenth century was classless, international, and precarious. The mercenary served any master: Protestant Germans happily fought under Spanish or French colours; Italian specialists served the queen of England or the Dutch; served them, that is, so long as they were paid. If they were not, they levied their subsistence and anything else they could get from the peasants and merchants among whom they were billeted. The Spanish Fury of 1574, when unpaid Spanish troops sacked and ransacked Antwerp, was only the most gruesome and spectacular example of the fate which befell countless towns and villages in north and central Europe in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as armies grew larger and more unmanageable, their pay more irregular, and they crawled with their crowds of camp followers over the face of the land like locusts, destroying any community luckless enough to find itself in their path. Not many of these soldiers of fortune attained great wealth and power. As so often happens, those did best who went in at the top. The men who set their stamp on the armies of the early seventeenth century were noble in their own right: the Marquis of Spinola, the Genoese who managed the military affairs of the king of Spain in the Netherlands; Count Ernest of Mansfeld who raised an army for the luckless Elector Pala- tine in 1618 and then put his sword at the dis

The International Red Cross Society had been founded after the Franco-Austrian War of 1859. International conferences had met, at Geneva in 1864 and 1906 and the Hague in 1899 and 1907, to regulate the treatment of civilians, of the wounded, and prisoners of war and (with considerably less success) the lethality of the weapons used. Partly as a result of these humanitarian activities and of the continuing operation of the spirit they expressed, the onset of 'mass-war' did not involve a relapse into barbarism. The Red Cross was on the whole respected. Enemy wounded were treated with humanity. Reciprocal caution and international inspection ensured the fair treatment of prisoners of war. As a result soldiers even in the front areas often lived in conditions which their predecessors would have had good reason to envy. They were regularly and adequately fed. Many of them indeed were better cared for, thanks to the development of ancillary military services, than they had been in civilian life at home. The image of the Great War which later developed in Europe as a period of almost unrelieved horror was not shared by many of the soldiers themselves when they returned to a post-war world which was for many of them disappointing and drab and for some one of real deprivation. At post-war regimental reunions they were able to persuade themselves-perhaps with increasing facility as they grew older-that the war with its comradeship and its adventures, its challenges and triumphs, its economic security and freedom from domestic responsibilities, had really been the happiest time in their lives.1 This nostalgia for a lost world of security,  118 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE WARS OFTHE TECHNOLOGISTS status, and purpose was to be a significant element in the confused political movements which were in the 1920s to give birth to various forms of Fascism.

It can be said that once Europe had shed her colonies it became a healthier and happier place. The same could not, alas, be said of all her former colonial possessions. These overseas campaigns may have been seen by the Europeans concerned as rearguard actions to defend their imperial sovereignty, but in Washington they came to be regarded as fronts in a global campaign against world communism. Even before the confrontation with the Soviet Union in Europe had been stabilized, war flared up in the Far East: a conflict that led the United States to place herself on a war footing and persuade her European partners to do the same. For the next two decades the focus of world conflict was to be in the Far East, and the main concern of European powers was to ensure that American attention did not become so absorbed in that region that the defence of their own continent became neglected. There had always been a strong lobby in Washington that had resented the priority American strategists had given to Europe in the Second World War, as against the recovery of American possessions in the Pacific, assistance to America's Chinese protégé Chiang Kai-shek, and the defeat of Japan. Japan had indeed been defeated , but immediately afterwards China had been 'lost': that is, the communist leader Mao-Ze-dong turned the guerrilla tactics that he had been using against Japanese occupation since 1937 against Chiang's corrupt and ineffective regime, and in 1949 drove it into exile on the island of Taiwan, establishing in its place the communist Peoples' Republic of China.

Washington, seeing it as her forward defence against the advance of global communism, provided first economic aid, then military advisers, finally massive military support. The US Army attempted to dominate the terrain by using helicopters and aerial gunships. The US Air Force used massive carpet-bombing, both on the battlefield and against North Vietnam herself, on the scale of the Second World War. But they did no better than the French. Air bombardment that might have been devastating against a Western army and an industrialized society had little effect against troops subsisting on handfuls of rice whose logistics depended on human porterage. American forces could give no ad- equate protection to villagers whose language they could not understand and whose sympathies naturally lay with their own countrymen. Nor, with all their enthusiasm, could the Americans motivate a government that appeared incor- rigibly lethargic and corrupt. Within the United States the war grew increas- ingly unpopular. In 1969 the Americans 'Vietnamesed' the war, leaving its conduct to the South-Vietnamese armed forces and withdrawing the bulk of their own troops. For a further five years they negotiated with the North Vietnamese government for an 'honourable solution'; but when in 1975 South Vietnamese resistance collapsed in front of a massive offensive, there was nothing to be done but cut their losses.

The Prussian officer corps was probably the most socially exclusive in Europe, and the Hohenzollerns kept it so; partly in fulfilment of what we would now term a social compact, partly because they placed particular reliance on the aristo- cratic code of honour and loyalty in ensuring both courage on the battlefield and obedience to the royal command. In France the nobility had a harder time asserting their prior claims to officers' commissions. The Bourbons, like other European monarchs, emasculated the political independence of the  70 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE WARS OF THE PROFESSIONALS aristocracy, the noblesse de l'épée, by providing them with jobs at court, in the army, and in the Church; but they considered an even more important qualification than noble lineage for the colonel of a regiment to be a full purse. So wealthy bourgeoisie were able to purchase social mobility with a commission, and they set a life-style with which the poor provincial noblesse, the equivalent of the Prussian junkers, were quite unable to keep up. The upper ranks of the French army in the eighteenth century thus became choked with the sons of well-to-do rôturiers and fashionable court families while the keen young nobles whose parents had neither wealth nor influence found promotion barred to them. Many, as a result, became increasingly alienated from the régime, looked longingly at the example of Spartan yet aristocratic efficiency provided beyond the Rhine and even at the yet more exciting modes of warfare which after 1776 appeared to be developing beyond the Atlantic.

Arguably, the long strug- gle in Vietnam had given those states breathing space to consolidate their post- colonial regimes and build up their economies, but none the less America's European allies viewed her involvement in Vietnam with apprehension if not outright disapproval, and refused to become involved. Of more concern to the Europeans were events in the Middle East. There the consolidation of the state of Israel after three wars with her Arab neigh- bours in 1948, 1956 and 1967, involving as they did the expulsion of much of the indigenous Arab population, had created widespread resentment through- out the Muslim world. Israel's Arab neighbours did nothing to absorb the Palestine refugees, who remained pinned up in crowded settlements on Israel's borders meditating revenge. Their young activists turned to terrorism, the weapon of the weak, to draw world attention to their plight, and Europe became part of the wider battlefield on which they fought their struggle for liberation. The most terrible incident occurred in September 1972 , when at the Munich Olympic Games Palestinian terrorists kidnapped the Israeli ath- letics team and murdered them in the course of a botched rescue operation. In 1985 another group hijacked the Italian cruise liner Achille Lauro, brutalizing the passengers and throwing one overboard.

The easy camaraderie of the old mercenaries, when seniority went with experience and young nobles trailed a pike or bore a musket with the ordinary soldiers of fortune, had given place to a rigidly hierarchial structure sharply divided between 'commissioned officers', who stood in a direct and personal relationship to the crown and who, whether they were born to it or not, adopted an aristocratic life style; and 'other ranks' regarded as a different order of being altogether, recruited from all over Europe by impressment or bounty, kept in order by a watchdog class of non-commissioned officers, disciplined by copious application of the lash and drilled until they were able even on the battlefield to perform like automata the elaborate evolutions which alone gave mobility to their long unwieldy lines, or-even more important-to stand immobile for hours while the enemy blazed away at them from point- blank range. Battles indeed were so destructive, and professional soldiers so difficult to replace, that generals in the eighteenth century 71 displayed the same reluctance to engage in them as had their mercenary predecessors two centuries earlier. Marshal Saxe in his Rêveries de Guerre (1732) made the much quoted state- ment: 'I do not favour pitched battles, especially at the beginning of a war, and I am convinced that a skilful general could make war all his life without being forced into one'. It was a view with which Frederick the Great in his Instructions for his Generals of 1747 expressed sympathy. 'The greatest secret of war and the masterpiece of a skilful general is to starve his enemy. Hunger exhausts men more surely than courage, and you will succeed with less risk than by fighting.

'To bear arms', to have a crest on one's helmet and symbols on one's shield instantly recognizable in the heat of battle, became in European society for a thousand years a symbol of nobility. For what it is worth it still is. But in the Middle Ages it was a symbol of function and available to all who performed that function. The nobility was not yet a close hereditary caste; war was still a career open to the talents. But having achieved nobility through military prowess, the man-at-arms was expected to comport himself according to a certain code of conduct. Very rapidly the warrior function became enhanced with a dimension of semi-numinous cere- mony. Much of the 'Middle Ages' is still seen through the distorting lenses of fifteenth century legend, which cast upon the whole world of 'chivalry' a golden and fictitious glamour, a sunset glow from a consciously disappearing society.3 But the concept of 'chivalry' itself, which was in essence simply the behaviour of chevaliers or knights, was certainly older-as old at least as the troubadours whose poetry in the dawn of European literature in the twelfth century hymned the virtues not only of courage but of honour, gentleness, courtesy and, by and large, chastity. The chevalier had to be not only sans peur but sans reproche.

The moment it was over a West India Company was formed to prey on the closed trading system which the Portuguese had built up over the past century in the South Atlantic : purchasing gold and ivory from West Africa, transporting slaves under hideous conditions from Africa to Brazil to work there on the sugar plantations, exporting the sugar thus grown to Europe. This involved the Dutch in an ill-judged and prolonged land war with the Por- tuguese in Brazil which swallowed many of their assets; but none the less when in 1640 Portugal again separated itself from the Spanish crown and sued for peace, both the East and the West India Companies petitioned against it. The directors of the former argued 'that the Honourable Company had  44 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE WARS OF THE MERCHANTS waxed great through fighting the Portuguese, and for this reason they had now secured a monopoly of most of the sea- borne trade in Asia; that they expected on average yearly return of between seven and ten millions; and that if they were allowed to continue in the same way, the above return would increase yearly.'3 For the Dutch, as for other merchants of the period, war paid off handsomely. We must not overestimate the contribution of these maritime enterprises to the growth of Dutch wealth in the seventeenth century. Only 0·2 per cent of the entire Dutch merchant fleet was involved even in the East India trade, and the West Indian venture was always suspect to the solid regents of Amsterdam.4 The staple trade of the Dutch was still that with the Baltic, an activity so essential to their economy that they happily continued, throughout the Eighty Years War with Spain, to act as carriers for the naval stores which Spain needed to maintain the fleets which protected Spanish com- merce against Dutch

For if war be- tween Christian and infidel could be exported, so also could war between Christians; and if Spanish and Portuguese Catholics could be led to the East and to the New World by a mixture of religious enthusiasm and avarice, a search for souls and a search for gold, so also could their Protestant enemies when, in the second half of the sixteenth century, the dynastic conflicts of western Europe broadened into the Wars of Religion. Sooner or later adventurers from north-west Europe would probably have broken in on the Iberian monopolies anyway. Much the same social forces were at work there as had driven the Castilian nobility to seek their fortunes beyond the sea. Internal pacification deprived the lesser nobility of their tradi- tional occupations; inflation made it impossible for them to keep up traditional standards; laws of inheritance either divi- ded estates into uneconomical parcels or reserved them for the eldest son, leaving the younger to seek their fortunes by their wits or their swords. In central Europe these were the men who became mercenaries. Those within reach of the coasts, the squireens of Normandy, Brittany, Devon, Cornwall, Holland, and Zeeland, provincials remote from the royal courts where they were anyhow far too poor to make their fortunes, turned to the sea. It was probably the same mixture of historical forces that inclined such men towards Protestantism; and the fact that they were so inclined made it an agreeable duty to turn 'privateer' and break in on monopolies established by author- ity of the Pope of Rome.

And if their nuclear research had taken a rather different turn and received greater political backing, they might have developed nuclear weapons, in the face of which the heroism of the Soviet peoples and the massive armadas of the Western allies would have been as ineffective as the charges of the Mahdi's tribesmen against Kitchener's armies at Omdurman. As it was, the first two atomic bombs were dropped on Japan by the United States in August 1945, each destroying a fair-sized city, between them killing 130,000 people outright. Used by one extra-European power against another, in termination of a conflict between them in which Europeans had figured only as auxiliaries, they marked the end of that era of European world dominance which the voyages of Columbus and Vasco da Gama had opened nearly five hun- dred years earlier. And they marked the close of the age of mass-warfare, of conflicts in which the fully-mobilized popu- lations of industrialized countries had devoted their full energies to overthrowing one another. Within a few years thermonuclear weapons were to be developed, each con- taining more destructive power than had been used by man- kind in its entire recorded history, with missiles capable of delivering them within minutes to any point on the surface of the world. Was there to be any place in the nuclear age for the traditional skills of professional soldiers or for the loyal participation of patriotic peoples? Had 'war', as it had been understood and conducted in Europe for a thousand years, come to an e

Michael Howard April 2008 I The Wars of the Knights "The origins of Europe', a historian of the Middle Ages has recently reminded us 'were hammered out on the anvil of war';1 and indeed 'war' is really too benign a term to describe the condition of the European continent once the precarious Pax Romana had disintegrated and waves of invaders swept over it; Goths and Vandals from the east, Moslems from the south and finally, most terrible of all, Vikings from the north. Nearly six hundred years elapsed between the first barbarian incursions in the fourth century and the end of the tenth century, when the last of the invaders had been either assimi- lated or repulsed. Then in their turn the peoples of Europe began to expand, first eastward and then, as they learned the arts of navigation, southward and westward. So for a time- span as long as that which divides the thirteenth century from our own day, 'peace' in Europe, that peace for which the congregations in Christian churches so sincerely prayed, existed only in exceptional and precarious oases of time and place. It is hardly surprising that an entire social pattern should have come into being to enable the peoples of Europe to survive in such an environment: the pattern to be known to later generations of historians as 'feudalism'. The successive quasi-nomadic warrior societies followed, clashed with, and absorbed one another like the waves of a turbulent sea. Following the Gothic and other invaders of the fourth century came those Frankish tribes who, loosely asso- ciated under the leadership of the Merovingian family, were to repulse the Moslems invading France from the south in the eighth century and to create, under the Carolingians at the beginning of the ninth, the short-lived unity of the west.

But the gens d'armes of the compagnies d'ordonnance established in the fifteenth century, and the corresponding infantry 'legions' raised by Francis I and paid from the royal exchequer in the sixteenth, were only a small part of armies which, in France as elsewhere in Europe, were raised, maintained, and led into battle by a class of entre- preneurs whose only bond of loyalty to their employer was the assurance of cash payment, punctually and in full. Military contractors of this kind had been flourishing in the Italian peninsula a couple of centuries before they took root north of the Alps. In Italy, as was mentioned in the last chapter, the fragmentation of the feudal structure by the Wars of Investiture left the nobility to their own devices, and the precocious development of an urban economy produced clients in the form of wealthy city-states who were prepared to pay them well for the hire of their military skills. In addition bands of foreign knights brought south by the German Emperors or washed up by the receding tides of the crusades were prepared, in the fourteenth century, to put their swords at the service of anyone who would pay them and to make life hell for anyone who did not. Among the most outrageous of these was the 'Great Company', a band nearly ten thousand strong and totally international in membership which persisted for fifteen years between 1338 and 1354 and ran what would now be called a protection racket on a very large scale. This group was succeeded a few years later by a mass of routiers, left unem- ployed by the ending of the Hundred Years War between France and England in 1361, who rode south from France under the standard of the Englishman Sir John Hawkwood and formed the famous White Company. Barbarous as these foreigners were, the Italians sometimes found that as employees they had advantages over their own warriors who were liable,
