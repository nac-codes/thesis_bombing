After the first checks inflicted on German forces by the superior French chassepot rifles, the Prussian generals kept their infantry out of range and used their guns to batter the French armies into submission. Already by 1870, therefore, it was becoming difficult for an attacking force to close with the enemy. Prussian infantry assaulting French positions and French cavalry attacking Prussian positions suffered horribly. Prussian victories in the field were due partly to their artillery and partly to the out- flanking tactics made possible by their superiority in numbers. After 1870 this difficulty was to be yet further increased. The 1 88os saw the development of high explosives-lyddite, cordite, melinite: materials which, unlike gunpowder, combusted totally and instantaneously, making no smoke to betray the position of the firer, leaving little deposit in the barrel to slow down the rate of fire, and increasing the range of all weapons to a hitherto inconceivable extent. Infantry rifles could now be made effective up to a thousand yards. Their calibre could be reduced, rendering them lighter and more accurate and making it possible for infantrymen to carry more ammunition. Magazines and metal cartridges improved the ease and rapidity of loading. And the performance of even these improved weapons was to be dwarfed by the introduction, towards the end of the century, of belt-fed, water-cooled machine-guns, firing several hundred rounds a minute. How could positions defended by such weapons possibly be assaulted? Tactical writers at the close of the century all agreed that the attack could succeed only by developing a greater intensity of fire than the defence. Concurrent developments in artillery made this appear possible. Increased ranges meant that field- guns no longer had to fire at a range of a few thousand yards over open sights, as in 1870: they could now be brought into action from up to five miles, firing from concealed positions

In the great spaces of eastern Europe where no continuous fronts were established, cavalry remained effective well into the twentieth century. In western Europe a few weeks were enough to make it clear, to all except some of their own commanders, that heavy cavalry was now an expensive anachronism. Even its rôle in reconnaissance was soon to be taken over by the motor-cycle and the armoured-car. Military thinkers in general did not underestimate the problems raised by the new weapons. The experiences of 1870 were to be reinforced by those of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-8, the British-Boer War in South Africa in 1899-1901, and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5; all of which illustrated 105 with increasing clarity the capacity of infantry dug into well- prepared positions and armed with modern weapons to inflict unsupportable casualties on assaulting forces. One independent observer, the Polish banker Ivan Bloch, on the basis of careful analysis of weapon performance, concluded in his book La Guerre Future (1898) that since it was now statistically impossible for attacks to succeed, war was no longer a viable instrument of policy at all. Military leaders understandably did not draw the same conclusion, but they did not deny that any force launching a frontal attack against prepared positions had to be prepared for very heavy casualties indeed ; while outflanking manoeuvres of the kind practised by the German armies in 1870 would call for enormous numbers. In either case the army with the greatest resources in man-power would enjoy a decisive advantage, and between 1871 and 1914 General Staffs vied with one another in demanding ever larger forces as the solution to their problems. The men who did so with the greatest urgency were the military planners in Berlin. The German General Staff had to plan to fight a two-front war, against both France and Russia.

Early in the sixteenth century the arquebus gave way to the long, heavy musket. This suffered the disadvantage of needing a fork to support it and a lengthy and cumbrous process for loading and firing; but it fired a ball which could crash  32 THE WARS OF THE MERCENARIES WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY through the heaviest armour at 300 yards, and so was invalu- able against charging cavalry. The English clung on to their beloved long-bows until almost the end of the century, their defenders arguing that they were lighter and handier than the musket, and enjoyed a higher rate of fire. But to be effective they required a prolonged and intensive training which was ceasing to be available even in England; and against armoured cavalrymen all seasoned campaigners preferred to rely on the heavy shot of the musketeer. Defence against cavalry however was not the original func- tion of 'shot'. As with the cross-bowmen whom they replaced, the hand gun men had the task of disorganizing and harassing the enemy force before the main encounter took place, when they slipped into the protection of the squares of pikemen who did the real business of fighting. It was the pikemen who stood steady to receive cavalry charges, checking horses at the end of their pikes, hauling off the riders with the hooks of their halberds, and finishing them off with their great swords. It was the pike squares which moved on the offensive, marching for- ward to the tap of drum and hacking their way through all opposition. In all sixteenth-century armies, save one, it was the man trailing the puissant pike who was held in highest honour.

Clumsily used against steady and well-sited regular troops like the British in the Peninsula or at Waterloo, such tactics could be suicidal. But the Prussians at Jena were no less steady and professional, and even their discipline collapsed after hours of bombardment and skir- mishing fire from adversaries they could not even see. And then when the line had at last collapsed Napoleon unleashed his cavalry in a pursuit designed to complete the destruction of the enemy and the enemy state; a deep penetration to spread panic among the enemy population and destroy all hope of recovery. But as wars continued and the quality of the conscripts deteriorated, Napoleonic tactics became little more than straightforward slogging matches. The troops raised after 1806 were taught neither to march nor to manoeuvre; barely even to fire their weapons. Such rudimentary skills as they needed 85 they picked up from their comrades on the march. At Aspern- Essling in 1809 Napoleon threw his columns into battle against the Austrians with minimal preparation, and suffered as a result a well-deserved defeat. Thereafter he tried to make up for the poor quality of his troops by multiplying the number of his guns, but even so he bought his victories at the expense of increasingly heavy casualties. Aspern was revenged at Wagram a few days later, but Napoleon lost 30,000 men in the process (as against 8,000 at Austerlitz). At Borodino in 1812 he did not attempt any manoeuvres against the Russian position but charged it head on, carrying it eventually with a loss of 30,000 men he could ill afford but entirely failing to destroy Kutusov's army.

More generally the kings of France developed a train of siege artil- lery before which the castles protecting the lands of the English crown in France crumbled into heaps of stones. The English military dominance which characterized Europe at the end of the fourteenth century had fifty years later completely dis- appeared; and the archers of Crecy and Agincourt were looked on as a historical curiosity. The future was to lie with foot soldiers of another kind. The simplest weapon with which a man on foot can be armed against cavalry is a spear; and if the spears are long enough, and the ranks are dense enough, and the morale of the men is high enough, such a formation can be almost invincible unless it can be broken up by some kind of bombardment. The Macedonian phalanx, after all, was the first infantry formation of which we have record. The supremacy of cavalry in the Middle Ages had been as much moral and social as technical. Developed because of its mobility, endowed with a total social and economic dominance, it had for centuries a virtual monopoly of military activity. Foot soldiers were simply despised auxiliaries. But the limitations on its effectiveness which had appeared in the thirteenth century when the house of Plantagenet tried to extend its rule into the mountains of Wales became yet more evident a hundred years later when the house of Austria tried to do the same in the mountains of Switzerland. 15 The original weapon of the Swiss mountaineers was not the pike which made them famous, but a simple axe, a halberd some eight foot long, with which they slaughtered the Austrian knights, hacking through their armour, not only when they trapped them in the defiles at Morgarten in 1315, but in the open field at Laupen in 1339 and Sempach in 1386; which bears out the view that the revival of infantry was due far more to moral, and thus social, factors than

Thus as shot became increasingly important and formations increasingly flexible the Swiss pike phalanxes became left behind like dinosaurs unable to adapt to a new environment, as much of a curiosity in the history of infantry as the English bowman of the later Middle Ages. Infantry fighting in the sixteenth century was to be shaped by professionals from Germany, and from Spain. The great rivals of the Swiss, the south German landsknechte, adapted themselves more easily to the changing requirements of war, if only because for their leaders war and its associated techniques was a pure business proposition and not, as it tended to become with the Swiss, an inflexible social institution. The landsknechte made their reputation with the pike, but as 'shot' became more important on the battlefield, they recruited that as well. Their area of recruitment, both socially and geographi- cally, was wider than that of the Swiss. The original landsknechte were drawn from the minor nobility of south Germany and their retainers. Early in the sixteenth century some of these knights began to expand and diversify their activities, recruit- ing cavalry 'lances' and artillery as well as pike and shot; and though German nobility remained for so long the backbone of these forces, minor knights who, without land or revenue, could not compete with the increasing wealth and display of their more fortunate neighbours, experienced troops of all classes and all nations were gradually drawn to their colours. By the end of the sixteenth century war was an international trade, and the proportion of nobility in these armies declined as the forces grew in size and attracted the adventurous or the desperate from every class.

H. Liddell Hart, who was already devising means of countering them by a combination of minefields, anti-tank guns, and armoured counter-attack. Certainly the blitzkrieg tactics of 1940 and 1941 need not have worked so effectively as they did. In their attack on the West in May 1940 the Germans took very great risks-risks indeed so great that the strategic concept behind their attack had at first been dismissed out of hand by the German High Command and it required, again, Hitler's intervention to make them accept it. Competent adversaries who kept their heads might have sealed off the penetration achieved by the German armoured spearheads in the Ardennes, and the campaign would have gone down to history as a disastrous gamble. Like Napoleon's victories it owed its success primarily to the demoralization of opponents who, after the leisurely pace of previous conflicts, could not adjust themselves to tactics based so overwhelmingly on speed, concentration, and surprise. And in 1941 against Soviet forces already dis- organized by the massive political épuration of their officer corps three years earlier, the success was to be even more far-reaching. == But such tactics could be rapid and decisive only against unprepared adversaries. The sceptics were in the long run right. If tanks could attack, tanks could counter-attack.

The pike came a little later, in time for the Swiss victories over the Burgundian chivalry in 1476 and 1477. By then the Swiss pikemen had learned not only how to stand on the defensive like a huge and invulnerable hedgehog, but how to move as well, their phalanxes-'battles' several thousand strong-trundling forward and annihilating anything unwise enough to remain in their path. Moreover once they had assured the independence of their own cantons they were prepared to rent out their 'battles' to neighbouring armies; a natural enough way of supporting a population becoming too great for its own sparse pastoral economy. But there was nothing in the Swiss tactics that could not be copied by others. Their neighbours in south Germany and Austria, equally impoverished, no less bellicose, began to raise their own formations, known as landsknechte or lansequenets. Their only difference from the Swiss was that they were drawn from a broader social spectrum: the nobility did not scruple, not only to raise and organize them, but to serve on foot in their ranks. Thereafter 'to trail a pike' became a perfectly acceptable form of military activity for the nobly-born in Germany, as later in England. As for Spain, heavy cavalry had never been a major component of the Christian armies in a country lacking forage and in the slow campaigns of the reconquista; and the Spanish kings found no problem in recruiting the poor, proud Castilian nobility to serve on foot in their wars. So by the end of the fifteenth century 'battles', or 'batta- lions', of pikemen were a necessary part of every serious armed force; and increasingly there were being attached to them contingents of men armed with hand guns, especially the 'hooked' gun, Hackenbüchse or arquebus, which with

Even then the defence developed night-fighters and learned how to confuse the electronic directional signals on which the attack depended. Like war at sea, war in the air became an immensely sophisticated exercise in tactical and technical ingenuity in which the professional fighting men were at least as dependent on the expertise of the scientist as they were on their own skills to carry out their task. It was only in the last years of the war, after a struggle demanding the full participation of the United States as well as the Royal Air Force, that the Allies secured a command of the air over Germany sufficient to enable them to inflict the degree of destruction on the enemy homeland that the prophets of air power had foretold. And even then civilian morale remained intact. The German people went stoically on with their business and obeyed their government until the very end of the war. The impact of technological change on the conduct of war by land was more diffuse. Within a few months of the outbreak of war in 1914 it had been realized that the internal combustion engine might be used to drive fighting vehicles as well as transportation. Within two years the first 'tanks' were in action. 131 But the design and use of these early armoured fighting vehicles was geared to the requirements of trench warfare. They were seen primarily as mobile fire power to help the attack break into the enemy's defensive lines; and once the first tactical surprise was over it was not too difficult to find means of countering them. The most spectacular breakthrough of the war, that achieved by the Germans on the Western Front in March 1918, was not the work of tanks at all, but of infantry. The Germans deployed, not in long lines of riflemen as had always been habitual, but as small groups of 'storm troops' armed with mortars, light machine-guns, and grenades, by-passing strong-points and penetrating wherever they f

But once these formations were broken by hostile fire, infantry were at the mercy of cavalry. So heavy cavalry armed with sword or sabre or-an importation from eastern Europe -lances, remained an effective arm. And it was from eastern Europe that there came, by way of the Habsburg armies, light cavalry for skirmishing and reconnaissance, always necessary in the wars against the Turks; while mobile fire power was provided by 'dragoons', horsemen so named after the light musket with which they were armed, and who could also be used, as their name implies, for internal coercion. As for guns, the process of their improvement after Gustavus Adolphus was very gradual until the eighteenth century, when the French once again took the lead. Under the supervision of the Inspector of Artillery, Jean-Baptiste de Gribeauval (1715- 89), artillery pieces became standardized, their parts were made interchangeable, improvement in charges increased the range and gunsights the accuracy of fire, and lighter carriages, by greatly reducing the draught power needed to move them, made them truly flexible weapons both on and off the battle- field, capable of concentration against any desired point. But more important than any technical development was that which occurred among the gunners themselves. They ceased to be regarded as a group of civilian specialists concerned only with the obscure technicalities of their sinister craft, and became in all European armies an integrated branch of the armed forces, uniformed and disciplined like all the rest if somewhat more scientific in their approach to war.

The effect of these lumbering convoys on the movement of armies over the un- surfaced roads of Europe may be well imagined. War in the winter was out of the question. Nor when they reached the battlefield did the guns really earn their keep. Their immobility meant that for maximum effectiveness they had to be drawn up in front of the army, or in the interstices of its formations, to give a single thunderous salvo or 'greeting' to the opposing force. This might indeed be horribly effective on the great squares of infantry, several thousands strong, which were deployed in front of them, and the immediate objective of the Swiss was always to overrun the enemy guns before they could do any serious harm. But with their slow rate of fire and the inaccuracy which resulted from a combination of the recoil and of the 'windage' which gun- founders prudently allowed between the projectile and the barrel, they often did no harm at all. As Machiavelli put it, 'Great Guns do without comparison oftener miss the Infantry than hit them, because the Foot are so low, and the Artillery so hard to be pointed, that if they be placed never so little too high, they shoot over; and never so little too low, they graze and never come near them.' An English writer a hundred years later, in 1604, said the same : 'Great artillery very seldom or never hurt', so long as the infantry 'upon their giving fire do but abase themselves on their knee till the volew be passed.'4 Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden was to change all that, as much else, but throughout the sixteenth century the infantry were to remain indisputably the queen of the battlefield. Small arms were quicker to make their mark. Hand guns were cheaper to produce and easier to use than cross-bows, and though they could not sustain a comparable rate of fire, their killing power against armoured horsemen was not less.

Simultaneously the flintlock firing mechanism was replaced by the far more reliable percussion cap. With these weapons the French, British, Russian, and Austrian armies fought their campaigns in the Crimea and in Italy in the 1850s. In these campaigns the Prussians played no part; so it was not until their war against Austria in 1866 that the effectiveness of the Dreyse 'needle gun' with which they had been equipping their infantry for the last twenty years could be gauged. This was the first rifled breech-loader-a clumsy weapon which lacked the range of the muzzle-loader and was, thanks to the massive escape of gas from the breech, very disagreeable to fire. But it fired three shots to the muzzle-loader's one, and posses- sed the supreme advantage that it could be fired lying down. For the first time in the history of war the infantryman could kill his adversary at a range of several hundred yards without presenting a target himself-an advantage which the Prussians put to such good effect in 1866 that all other European armies rapidly acquired improved breech-loaders of their own. In artillery the same development took place. By 1860 all European armies were equipped with various kinds of muzzle- 103 loading rifled cannon with ranges of between one thousand and three thousand yards. Here the Prussian army lagged behind both the Austrian and the French; but the indifferent performance of their guns in 1866 led to a rapid revolution in their tactics and the introduction of the new steel breech- loading cannon developed by Friedrich Krupp. These guns dominated the battlefields of 1870.

After 1871 the Prussian institutions-conscription, stra- tegic railways, mobilization techniques, above all the General Staff-were copied by every state in continental Europe. Thirty years later, after disastrous experiences in South Africa and Cuba, Britain and the United States adapted the model to their own needs. Side by side with this administrative revolution went the technological. We have seen how slowly, between the fifteenth and the nineteenth centuries, weapons-systems developed within the stable economic framework of European society; the gradual, piecemeal fashion in which cannon became more mobile and slightly more accurate, the adaptations which converted matchlock into flintlock, pike into bayonet, without  102 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE WARS OF THE NATIONS substantially increasing the range of fire or transcending the limits on mobility imposed by human and equine capabilities. But between 1815 and 1914, as the revolution in communica- tions was to transform strategy, so the revolution in weapons technology was to transform tactics. Already by 1870 firearms had undergone one transformation. First came rifling-the spiral grooves on the inside of the barrel which increased both range and accuracy by a factor of about five. The principle had been applied to sporting guns since the sixteenth century and rifles had been used by light infantry specialists since the eighteenth. But loading them at the muzzle made for a very slow rate of fire; they were generally regarded as weapons of precision too delicate for general issue, and sheer volume of fire was considered more important in the infantry line than either range or accuracy.

The remarkable thing about Creçy was not so much the havoc the long-bowmen caused to the French chivalry- more than 1500 killed, according to reliable authorities, for about a hundred English casualties5-but the fact that they remained to cause any havoc at all; instead of fleeing, as infantry normally did in medieval warfare, at the first onset of the enemy horse. Crecy was not the first occasion on which the mounted feudal host had been worsted by foot soldiers. In 1302 the bur- ghers of Courtrai had successfully stood their ground with pike and spear against the mounted knights of the Count of Artois. But the humiliation of Crecy forced the French chivalry, the fashionable pacemakers of the western world, to reconsider their equipment and their tactics. They abandoned chain mail for plate armour-a material which anyhow lent itself far more readily to decorative ornamentation indicating wealth and status; and they also dismounted for battle. This they did partly because of the vulnerability of their horses; partly because of the growing expense of maintaining a force of fully- equipped 'lances'; but partly out of considerations of pure gallantry: a dismounted knight could not flee to save himself but had to stand and fight. So long as they stood and fought the French chivalry enjoyed some success. But when they attacked, their invulnerability to arrows was outweighed by their ponderousness of movement and restriction of vision, which enabled the English to notch up two further victories at Poitiers in 1356 and most notably in Agincourt in 1415; where the English killed probably five thousand Frenchmen (a thou- sand after they had taken them prisoner) for the loss of a few hundred men of their own.6 By the fifteenth century a 'man-at-

So when in the 1930s Britain began with enormous reluctance to re-arm, resources were allocated, not to an army equipped to fight a traditional land campaign, but to an air force capable of striking terror into the heart of the enemy-a capacity which would, it was hoped, deter Germany from initiating war at all. As it happened, the British aircraft industry showed itself unable to compete with the German, and it was Germany who first built up an air force apparently capable of inflicting  130 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE WARS OF THE TECHNOLOGISTS immediate and unavoidable destruction on her neighbour's cities; a threat which Hitler used to good effect in the imple- mentation of his policy. It was taken for granted that there could be no defence against air attack-that the bomber, in the words of Stanley Baldwin, would always get through. It was also assumed, largely on the basis of two German air raids on London in July 1917, that the bomber, having got through, would wreak havoc on a vast and unacceptable scale. Events were to show both assumptions to be, if not false, at least greatly over-stated. In the later 1930s the development of fast-climbing low-wing monoplanes, and of radar interception techniques to give early warning of enemy attack, made it possible for defending forces to exact an unacceptably high price from bombers attempting to penetrate deep into their territory by day. When attacking forces took to bombing by night it took them some time to learn how to use radar offensively by the projection of beams which made possible accurate blind navigation, and scanning devices which re- vealed the topography of the ground through darkness or cloud.

The Spanish commander Gonsalvo di Cordova quickly accommodated him- self to the new style. He provided not merely pike but arque- buses in greater numbers than his adversaries; and like Edward III of England with his long-bows at Crecy, he transformed the arquebus from an auxiliary harassing weapon for the attack into a decisive one in the defence. This he did by using it in combination with field fortifications. The battle of Cerignola in 1503 set a pattern to be frequently repeated. The Spaniards allowed their enemies, both French cavalry and Swiss pike, to batter in vain against their fortified positions while the arquebuses picked them off, till they were too weakened to stand up to the Spanish counter-attack. The most triumphant example of all was to be Charles V's crowning victory at Pavia in 1525, when Francis I was himself taken prisoner. In the twenty-one years of fighting between the battle of Fornovo in 1494 and Pavia in 1525 we can see fire power moving from a purely auxiliary rôle to one where it was central and decisive; when the arquebus was no longer a minor appurtenance of the pike square, but when the pike square's principal function was to protect the shot. This the Spaniards recognized when they reorganized their infantry in 1534 into tercios of 3000 men each. Instead of having one musketeer to every six pikemen, as had been habitual in the Italian wars,  34 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE WARS OF THE MERCENARIES they had equal numbers of each, and the musketeers received specialist pay. The process was beginning which was to end with the pike surviving only as a bayonet on the end of the infantryman's musket.

In essence they were not very different from that which we have seen Charles VIII leading into Italy in 1494 : cavalry, infantry armed partly with pike, partly with hand guns, and artillery trains. Still, during this period such extensive developments took place within each of the three arms that by 1648 the armies fighting in Europe had more in common with those of Marlborough and Frederick the Great in the eighteenth century than with those of Francis I and Charles V in the sixteenth. These deve- lopments were due, not to any striking technological or scientific advances, but rather to a process of trial and error and to minor adjustments in the craft of weapon-making within a very stable and limited technological framework-a framework which was to remain fundamentally unaltered until the industrial transformations of the nineteenth century. The most striking innovation of the late Middle Ages, fire- arms, were slow to take effect on the battlefield, and this was particularly true of artillery. In siege warfare the great guns were indeed to have profound and lasting effects, but as auxiliaries to the armies of the day their effectiveness was slight compared with their heavy cost. This made itself felt not only through the cost of the weapons themselves but in all the problems involved in deploying them on the battlefield. The eighteen guns proudly deployed by the Duke of Milan in 1472 required 522 pairs of oxen and 227 carts to draw them and their train. The French replaced oxen by horses and stone cannon-balls by the more destructive iron, but the whole apparatus remained ineffably ponderous. By the end of the sixteenth century it was generally reckoned that a single gun needed a team of twenty to thirty horses to draw it, with a further forty to pull its ammunition carts. The effect of these lumbering convoys on the movement of armies over the un- surfaced roads of Europe may be well imagined. War in the winter

In practice the Great War, by destroying so much of the traditional framework of European society, had greatly strengthened the revolutionary forces both of the Left, who believed that the millenium would not come without further armed conflict both national and international, and of the Right, who saw in the continuation of international conflict the necessary destiny of man. The victorious powers were therefore in a position to enforce their ideology only if they had the strength to do so, which in the absence of the United States they had not. As a result, fifteen years after the Versailles settlement, the nations of Europe found themselves once again preparing for war. The kind of war which Fascism glorified was not that fought by masses of hapless conscripts at the behest of generals far behind the lines. It was one which would be conducted by  120 WAR IN EUROEPAN HISTORY THE WARS OF THE TECHNOLOGISTS small teams of young heroes, airmen, tank-crews, storm- troops, 'supermen' who by daring and violence would wrest the destiny of mankind from the frock-coated old dodderers round their green baize tables and shape a cleaner, more glorious future. War would, they hoped, in future be a business for élites. They were not altogether wrong. Technology, which in the nineteenth century had made mass participation in war- fare both possible and necessary, was in the twentieth to place increasing power in the hands of highly qualified technicians. The Second World War was to see a curious blend of mass participation and deadly esoteric duels between technological experts. By the second half of the century the peoples of Europe were to be extruded almost totally from conflicts which, if they came, would be fought by comparatively small numbers of military technicians wielding destructive power on an almost inconceivable scale.

But', he went on, 'since it is very rare that a war is ended by the capture of a depot and matters are only decided by great battles, it is neces- sary to use all these means to attain this object'. Indeed, he wrote, 'War is decided only by battles and is not finished except by them. Thus they have to be fought, but it should be opportunely and with all the advantages on your side . . . . The occasions that can be procured are when you cut the enemy off from his supplies and when you choose favourable terrain'.4 These quotations indicate something of the nature, problems, and objectives of eighteenth-century strategy. The problem of keeping an army some 70,000 strong provided with a continu- ous flow of food, fodder, and ammunition as it moved through hostile country was the first which the general had to learn to master, and many never got beyond that. No campaign could be opened until sufficient supplies for the season had been accumulated in the frontier fortresses; and since fodder for horses and mules constituted a major need of armies on the move, no move could be made until the end of the spring. The speed of any advance was then limited not only by the distances which heavily-laden troops could be expected to march over bad roads in a single day, but by the rate at which magazines could be built up along the lines of communication in their rear and the time which supply convoys took to move from base to magazine and from magazine to the front. It is indeed at this time that such expressions as base, flanks, lines of com- munication, interior and exterior lines began to enter the military vocabulary. Within a few days at most the advancing army would come  WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY 72 THE WARS OF PROFESSIONALS upon an enemy fortress, and the commander had to decide to bypass it or to besiege it.

The army where these talents most abounded, as a result of their long campaigns against the Turks in south-east Europe, was that of the Habsburg Empire. For the defence of their frontiers the Imperial Army has recruited local talent of a unique kind : Croatian pandours, Hungarian huszars, and Albanian stradiots, mainly light cavalry to scout and raid. When in 1741 the Empress Maria Theresa had to defend her western lands against the depredations of Prussia and France in the War of the Austrian Succession, she used these forces to very good effect. Her adversaries complained that these light troops, operating independently far ahead and on the flanks of the main Imperial armies, were no more than brigands and murderers, but they had to take steps to counter them. So both the French and the Prussian armies began to recruit special  78 WAR IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THE WARS OF THE REVOLUTION battalions of chasseurs or jägers, huntsmen used to stalking game in broken ground, who could fight in mountains or forests. Frederick the Great recruited his own huszars and, very much against his will, established Freibattailonen to conduct the guerre des postes; although he dismissed them contemptuously as 'Adventurers, Deserters and Vagabonds who were distin- guished from the regular infantry only by the lack of what made the infantry strong, namely, Discipline'. Another school for skirmishers was the forests of North America where British, French, and American troops alike learned the limited value of regular European tactics and where 'irregular' warfare proliferated. By the eve of the Revolutionary Wars light infantry formations of various kinds, often clad in the distinc- tive huntsman's green for camouflage, were an accepted part of all European armies.1 As for artillery, something has already been said about the reforms introduced in the French Army in the 176os by Jean-Baptiste de Gribeauval which
