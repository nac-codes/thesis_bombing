The latter alternative is the method which the lessons of military history seem to recommend, but the Air Staff are convinced that the former is the correct one. For the conduct of the air offensive against an enemy power (the belligerent countries, not named, would be "separated by 20 or 30 miles of sea"), the Air Staff suggested that fighters would play almost no role. The distances involved would make it impossible to build a fighter that would have sufficient range and efficiency. Thus, the Air Staff could state "as a principle that the bombing squadrons should be as numerous as possible and the fighters as few as popular opinion and the necessity for defending vital objectives will permit.'''7 In May 1928, Trenchard further elaborated for the benefit of his fellow chiefs of Staff the view expressed in the above memorandum that air forces could alter "the lessons of military history." The CAS claimed that it would not be necessary for an air force, as with the other services, to defeat the enemy's armed forces in order to defeat his nation. "Airpower can dispense with that immediate step. . . ." While Trenchard admitted that it would be wrong and "contrary to the dictates of humanity" to conduct "indiscriminate bombing of a city for the sole pupose of terrorizing the civilian population," he argued that it was an entirely different matter "to terrorize munition workers (men and women) into absenting themselves from work or stevedores into abandoning the loading of a ship with munitions through fear of attack. . . ."'18 If Trenchard can be accused

As the head of the army's Rumanian mission suggested, war had returned to the religious and ideological basis of the Thirty Years' War: Germany's opponents were the financiers, Freemasonry, and the financial and political power of the World Jewry.58 Far too many officers acquiesced in outrages, such as the murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews by SS commando teams (Einsatzgruppen), while the starvation of literally hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of prisoners was directly attributable to Wehrmacht authorities. 59 The widespread acceptance of Hitler's goals and attitudes throughout the officer corps made possible the terrible atrocities that occurred. It was not merely a matter of Hitler and the SS. On the political side of the invasion, the scale of criminality quickly disabused disaffected Russians and Ukrainians of the notion that the Germans might be their liberators. German atrocities rallied the population to the defense of a thoroughly unpopular and vicious regime. On the military side, a sense of a racial and cultural superiority, shared by most German officers, contributed to an underestimation of Russia's powers of resistance.

This work never appeared in general print but can be read in a number of archives including the AFSHRC and the AHB: Air Ministry, The Rise and Fall of the German Air Force (London, 1948). Perhaps the most provocative and challenging work on the strategic bombing offensive is Anthony Verrier, The Bomber Offensive (London, 1968).

Noble Frankland has produced a readable, incisive summary of the overall bombing offensive for Ballantine Books: Noble Frankland, Bomber Offensive, The Devastation of Europe (New York, 1970). He has also written an excellent summary of British operations, The Bombing Offensive Against Germany (London, 1965). Both works are useful departure points.

The launching of attacks by the pooled resources of Allied air forces would force the Germans to divert significant resources from the western front to home defense and to exacerbate further Germany's strategic difficulties. In conclusion, they noted: that the alternative to such diversion would be that the German government would be forced to face very considerable and constantly increasing civil pressure which might result in political disintegration. In this connection, if the Allies are to reap the full benefit of the reaction in Germany due to the failure of the German effort in 1918, it is essential that no time shall be lost in developing coordinated and widespread strategic air attacks to synchronize with a period of acute popular depression. 322   ## p. 323 (#343) ############################################  This emphasis on the results that "strategic" bombing would have on German morale is contained in an October 1918 Air Ministry paper on both the morale and material impact of air raids against Germany.

Organizations that have not been willing to examine the past, especially their own, have usually paid a price for that oversight. We stand today on the far side of a gulf of time which separates us from the experiences of the Second World War. Nearly forty years ago, the Allied Air Forces fought an extensive, costly battle for air superiority over the European continent. The air war over Europe represented a great struggle between fully mobilized industrial powers. This conflict had the scale, characteristics, and balance of strength between both sides which we might well experience in a future conflict. Though over time we were able to

In conference with leading members of his staff in July 1923, Trenchard underscored his faith in "strategic" bombing and his belief that the British people would exhibit greater staying power in a bombing exchange. Trenchard argued: I would like to make this point again. I feel that although there would be an outcry, the French in a bombing duel would probably squeal before we did. That was really the first thing. The nation that would stand being bombed longest would win in the end. Trenchard said that he strongly disagreed with the view that it would be better to add four fighter squadrons to defend Great Britain than four bomber squadrons to hit the French. He suggested that 48 more bombing aircraft would exercise a strong impact on French morale, while the downing of a few bombers "would have very little effect." One senior officer objected that if a French squadron came over Britain with 12 aircraft and returned with 4, it would adversely affect their morale. Trenchard agreed that this would have a greater effect on the morale of the French pilots than it would on ours. Casualties affected the French more than they did the British. That would have to be taken into consideration too, but the policy of hitting the French nation and making them squeal before we did was a vital one—more vital than anything else. 16 324   ## p. 325 (#345) ############################################  In March 1924, the Air Staff presented its case in a memorandum on the proper objectives of an air offensive.

Achieve the maximum of effect on the morale by striking at the most sensitive part of the German population— namely, the working class. 10 The actual conduct of operations, however, pointed out most of the considerable problems that Bomber Command would face in the Second World War. Aircrew training, lack of aircraft, and serviceability, as well as weather and navigational difficulties, all combined to keep Trenchard's bomber force at a rather limited stage of effectiveness." Some of these problems, including even the thorny problem of nighttime navigation, were examined at least in conception, if not in detail, by elements within the Royal Navy Air Service in the years before creation of the Royal Air Force. 12 Nevertheless, the full complexity of the problem of accurately placing bombs on targets unfortunately remained obscure to many post-war commanders. With the coming of peace, the British government made wholesale cuts in military expenditures. For all intents and purposes, by 1933 the British had disarmed almost as thoroughly as the Treaty of Versailles had disarmed the Germans (the Royal Navy was, of course, an exception). Trenchard, once again as Chief of Air Staff, confronted a dwindling establishment of squadrons and personnel due to decreased military funding. With relatively few resources, RAF commanders justifiably feared that loss of aircraft or crews to the navy (for aircraft carriers) or army (for close air support missions) would threaten the existence of their service. 13 Army and navy leaders may well have persisted in demands for the return of such aircraft precisely to remove one of the hungry mouths at the treasury's increasingly spare dinner table. 323   ## p. 324

The slow and hesitant approach towards Russia in the summer of 1939 hardly indicated serious preparation for war. Also during this period, the British offered the Germans a major economic loan if they behaved themselves— hardly the sort of policy to deter Adolf Hitler.4 The Führer's reaction to British criticism and diplomatic activity was at first outrage and then contempt. As he told his staff, he had seen his opponents at Munich and they were worms. After hearing that the British had extended a guarantee to Poland at the end of March, he shouted: "I'll cook them [the British] a stew they'll choke on." But as the summer progressed, Hitler seems to have convinced himself that Britain would not intervene in a military campaign against Poland. Both the aforementioned inadequacies of British diplomacy and the skill with which Hitler manipulated the European powers led him to conclude that he could get away with a small war on Poland. By signing the Nazi-Soviet Non Aggression Pact, thus removing the Soviet Union from the list of possible enemies, Hitler, in effect, isolated the Poles more thoroughly than he had the Czechs the previous year. Further confirming Hitler in his small war thesis was the consensus among the Luftwaffe that the threat of "strategic" bombing (or terror bombing) would serve to keep the Western Powers out of an eastern war. Ironically, the unpreparedness of the Luftwaffe in the fall of 1938 played a role in Hitler's decision not to push the Czech crisis into a direct military confrontation but rather to negotiate at Munich.

In late June 1940, Admiral Dudley Pound told the French liaison officer at the Admiralty that "the one object we had in view was winning the war and that it was as essential for them [the French] as for us that we should do so. . . . All trivialities, such as questions of friendship and hurting people's feeling, must be swept aside. ''75 Indeed they were, when for strategic reasons, the British government ordered the Royal Navy to attack and sink the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir.76 The Germans missed the new British resolve almost completely, and Hitler's strategic policy from the summer of 1940 though 1941 sought a method, whether it be military, diplomatic, or political, to persuade the British to make peace. The mood in Berlin was euphoric, since the Germans believed that the war was nearly over. All that remained, from their viewpoint, was to find the right formula for ending hostilities. Confirming this perspective was a strategic memorandum of late June in which Alfred Jodl, the number two man in the OKW, suggested that "the final victory of Germany over England is only a question of time."77 Jodl's approach to the English "problem" reflected a general failing within the officer corps of all three services. As the campaign in the west in 1940 had shown, the tactical and operational performance of German military forces was without equal. The problem lay on a higher level: that of strategy. The Germans, if they had mastered the tactical and operational lessons of World War I, had not mastered the strategic lessons of that terrible conflict. While the French failure to learn from the last war had immediate consequences in May 1940, in the long run German unwillingness to face that war's strategic lessons had an even more catastrophic impact on their history.

What undoubtedly made the Germans choke was Molotov's proposal that a two-nation commission control the Skagerrak, entrance and exit to the Baltic-the proposed nations being the Soviet Union and Denmark. Adding further to the German discomfort were Molotov's tactless contradictions of the Führer and his justly famous rejoinder to Joachim von Ribbentrop's (the German Foreign Minister) comment that Britain was finished; why then, he asked, were they in an air raid shelter?¹2 Molotov's behavior, typical of Soviet diplomatic practices that have subsequently worked so well in dealings with the West, made a disastrous impression on his hosts and undoubtedly contributed to the German decision to settle matters with the Soviets that coming summer. There had been, moreover, a general deterioration in relations between the two powers since the summer of 1940.3 Stalin had taken advantage of German preoccupation in the west to incorporate Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia into the Soviet Union. More threatening to German interests was the Russian move against Rumania in July 1940, when the Soviets forced their neighbor to surrender not only the province of Bessarabia (covered by the Nazi-Soviet Non Aggression Pact) but the province of Bukovina as well (not covered by the agreement). Hitler's reply to what he regarded as a threat to German interests in the Balkans, particularly Rumanian oil, was direct and forceful.

Moreover, foreign suppliers already were becoming doubtful as to the liquidity of the German economy and, as a result, would not deliver on credit. By 1935, this situation had caused significant portions of German industry to draw down stockpiles. From March to December 1935, stockpiles of major industrial raw materials fell dramatically; and for the remainder of the 1930's, the German economy lived a hand-to-mouth existence, scratching to find sufficient foreign exchange to pay for imports. By 1937, the German economy was suffering serious shortages of steel because of a lack of ore imports, while the industry itself was operating at barely 83 percent of capacity. 10 These economic difficulties affecting rearmament most likely played a role in pushing Hitler into the confrontations of 1938. Here again, despite substantial financial gains made by the Anschluss with Austria, efforts to expand the rearmament program, to build up synthetic and munition industries, to begin the massive construction of the Westwall project, and to mobilize for the Czech crisis severely strained the German economy. In November 1938, Hermann Göring admitted that the German economic infrastructure had reached a point of maximum economic distress." As a direct result, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), the German armed forces high command, made major reductions in steel and raw 2   ## p. 3 (#31) ###############################################  ORIGINS AND PREPARATION material allocations to armament production. 12 Continuing difficulties led Hitler to announce to the Reichstag on January 30, 1939, that Germany must wage an "export battle" (Exports

Hitler fully recognized the diplomatic difficulties when he commented before meeting with Franco and Pétain that the need of the hour was a gigantic fraud. 10 Conversations with the French and particularly the Spanish led nowhere, and upon return to Berlin Hitler remarked that he would sooner have "three or four" teeth pulled than face another conversation with Franco. Hitler had missed the bus." In the early summer in the full flush of victory, he might well have persuaded Spain to participate. After Mers-el-Kebir, had he granted substantial concessions to France in terms of the eventual peace treaty, he might also have enlisted Vichy support. However, with the Wehrmacht's overwhelming success, he felt no need to cut Spain in on the loot or to mitigate the onerous terms he wished to impose on France. Now in the fall of 1940, it was too late; the Spanish and the French recognized that the war was not over. The former made impossibly high demands concerning the price for Spain's entrance into the war; the latter decided to wait on further events despite bitterness against the British for Mers-el-Kebir. There remained only the Russians as a means of pressuring the British. Since Hitler had hoped to end the war in the west so that he could solve the eastern question, one can wonder how seriously the Führer ever considered the possibility of a closer alliance with Russia. Nevertheless, in November 1940, the Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, arrived in Berlin to explore further cooperation between the dictatorships. The Russians overplayed their hand. Stalin seems to have believed his diplomatic position was stronger than, in fact, it was. Thus, Molotov was at his most truculent, brushing aside German suggestions that the Soviets interest themselves in the Persian Gulf, Iran, and India. While such goals were not entirely out of the range of Soviet expectations, Molotov emphasized more concrete and immediate aims in Europe. Among other items, he suggested

The next morning, Harris finally brought up the subject of the war in the south. 99 He had only one question to put, he said, and he wanted a straight answer, "yes or no-nothing more. "Could heavy bombers be used to bomb coastal defenses?" I paused a second, and then said, "yes." It was clearly not the answer he wanted, and no further word [on the subject] was spoken.⁹ One has the feeling that Harris embarked on the "area" bombing of Berlin as a matter of faith. Science and research were useful only insofar as they supported his campaign and arguments. In retrospect, it appears that Harris hoped to win the war in the winter of 1943-44 with Bomber Command alone. He told one senior commander at the time that his (Harris') forces would have to show the world. 10 Unfortunately, there comes a point where the maintenance of the objective crosses the fine line between realistic 212   ## p. 213 (#233) ############################################  ATTRITION OVER THE REICH perserverance and stubborn adherence to preconceived ideas." Haig had crossed that line in 1917; Harris now also crossed that line. In fairness to the Air Marshal, one must note that no other commander in the war bore greater strain. Every night from February 1942 through spring 1945, Harris decided whether his command. would strike or not, a decision on which rested the lives and welfare of his crews. In the 1942-43 period, that strain was particularly heavy in view of difficulties facing Bomber Command. By the fall of 1943, Harris had held his position for a year and three-quarters; he was tired and under great stress. Thus far, he had waged his campaign for the most part with skill, and it is difficult to imagine the bombing effort achieving the same degree of success under another commander. Nevertheless, the Battle of Berlin suggests that a new commander in late 1943 might have shown greater flexibility (never Harris' strongest attribute), t

Complicating the diplomatic situation was the fact that Hungary and Rumania were on the brink of war over the province of Transylvania. 14 To the Germans, such a disruption of Balkan relations was unacceptable. Under pressure from both Ribbentrop and Ciano, the Rumanians surrendered substantial territory to Hungary. 15 With that difficulty cleared up, the Germans turned to bolster a Rumanian regime badly shaken by a serious diplomatic defeat. The Germans moved with their usual speed. In early September, they supported the establishment of a pro-German military regime under General Ion Antonescu. At the end of the month, they sent a military "mission" consisting of a motorized infantry division, supported by flak and air units, to protect the oil region and to demonstrate German support for the new regime. One of the "mission's" major tasks was: "In case a war with Soviet Russia is forced upon us, to prepare for the commitment of German and Rumanian forces from the direction of Rumania."'16 These German moves, all without consultation, elicited a vigorous response from the Russians. They protested strongly against the Vienna Accords that had settled the difficulty between Rumania and Hungary, and the movement of German motorized troops into Rumania could not have contributed to a Soviet sense of well-being. Equally disturbing, in view of Soviet interests in the Baltic, was a Finnish-German agreement that allowed the Germans to transport substantial forces through Finland to northern Norway. Of the 4,800 troops involved in the move, 1,800 remained in Finland for a considerable period. Under these circumstances, the Russians had every right to be suspicious. 18 Given these frictions, the rapacious nature of the two dictators' appetites, as well as Hitler's belief that only in the east could Germany achieve the living space she needed, the 71   ## p. 72 (#100) #############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT conflict between Russia and Germany was

But before his death, Udet, with Milch's backing, produced a plan in July 1941 calling for a radical restructuring of German industry to accelerate production. 152 A more detailed, longer-range plan came out in September under Milch's guidance. Based on a change in priorities after the completion of "Barbarossa,"153 Milch's production projection demanded nearly 50,000 aircraft from industry by March 1944. For 1942, the so-called "Göring plan" asked for approximately 33 percent more aircraft than had been produced in 1941. For fighter aircraft, the Göring plan asked for a 61.1 percent increase in monthly fighter production in 1942 and a 20.5 percent increase in bomber production. By the end of 1943, Milch foresaw a rise in the monthly production rate for fighters to 625 (a 101 percent rise over the 1941 average) and for bombers to 656 (an increase of 81.2 percent over 1941 production). 154 Unlike Udet who had gloomily assumed in June 1941 that given the resources, the work force, and the industrial capacity then available, the aircraft industry could not substantially increase production. 155 Milch took a different line. In a speech to the aircraft industry's chief industrialists, Milch outlined the production increases enumerated in the new plan. He demanded that the industrialists judge what was possible and what was not. Further, he refused to allow industry to proceed with serial production of new aircraft, because he demanded the mass production of existing types. 156 Delays imposed by the search for quality were a major factor in minimizing aircraft production. Indeed, the quality versus quantity dilemma was a factor Milch never succeeded in reconciling with the German industrial system. Right through 1944, German aircraft possessed the finest upholstered crew seats; thousands of man-hours were wasted in machining bulkheads and minor fittings, while parts taking no strain or
