There were already signs that this situation was breaking down. German successes in September and October were won, moreover, at a high cost to themselves. The Germans lost 276 fighters in the west in September (17.4 percent of the total fighter force as of September 1) and 284 more in October (17.2 percent).

In the long run, considering the massive influx of bombers, fighters, and crews already swelling American bases in England, Eighth held the strategic advantage. It was, of course, difficult for the crews who flew to Schweinfurt to recognize that advantage.

Schweinfurt was, of course, a turning point and forced fundamental changes in American doctrine and strategy. For the Germans, however, the pressure eased only marginally after Schweinfurt. Moreover, from the Luftwaffe's perspective, October 14 did not appear as important or decisive as it did for the Americans. The debate within the high command continued unabated, and Göring and Hitler as they had throughout the summer-proved unwilling to address fundamental strategic questions. In early November, Galland warned the fighter forces of Göring's dissatisfaction with their October achievements: The fighter and heavy formations have not been able to secure decisive success in air defense against American four- engined formations. The introduction of new weapons . . . has not appreciably changed the situation. The main reason for the failure is that the Kommandeure and Kapitane [sic] do not succeed in securing attacks in close formation up to the shortest ranges. . . The Reichsmarschall has, therefore, ordered the setting up of an assault Staffel (Sturmstaffel). Its tasks will be to break up the enemy by using more heavily armored fighters in all-out . . . attacks. . . .

By the end of August, the Germans had lost 248 single-engine fighters (16.2 percent of their then available total single- engine fighter force) along with 86 twin-engine fighters (11.6 percent of the twin- engine and night fighter force) in air battles in the west. 182 In fact, the whole emphasis in the European air war had shifted radically away from a contest on the periphery to a massive battle of attrition over the Reich. Concurrently, Allied fighter forces were feeling their way deeper into the Reich and consequently restricting the area over which German fighters could intercept the bombers. Thus, at the end of August, the daylight air war in the west was peaking with each side inflicting serious damage on the other. It still remained an open question as to which air force could last the course. LOSSES, PRODUCTION, AND STRATEGY On August 18, 1943, the Luftwaffe's Chief of Staff, Jeschonnek, placed a gun to his temple and blew his brains out. His suicide was the direct result of the two massive blows Allied bombers had launched the previous day and evening (Schweinfurt/Regensburg and Peenemünde). While neither raid represented a decisive blow, together they clearly indicated the bankruptcy of Germany's air strategy. If there were others who deserved a significant share of the blame, and Hitler as well as Göring spring readily to mind, then Jeschonnek's role typified the part that so many of the officer corps had played in Germany's fate. Like too many of his brother officers, Jeschonnek had ignored the industrial, logistical, and technical basis on which modern war between industrialized states since the American Civil War has been fought. That curious blindness which led him in early 1942 to wonder what the Luftwaffe would do with 360 fighters had now led his air force and nation into a hopeless situation. The battles on the peripher

Its results shattered the theory that the German defensive system lacked depth. Both formations suffered heavy losses. The Regensburg force lost 24 bombers out of 146 dispatched (16.4 percent) and only the fact that they flew on to North Africa, thereby disconcerting German defenses, prevented heavier losses. 139 In fact, the number of aircraft written off was higher than 24, for the Regensburg forces left approximately 20 B-17's in North Africa when they returned to Europe. 140 The second force, attacking Schweinfurt, received no benefit from the first attack because bad weather had delayed its departure. As a result, German fighters savaged it as thoroughly as they had the Regensburg force. Out of 230 bombers, the Schweinfurt groups lost 36 (15.7 percent). The loss of 60 bombers in one day represented the loss of 10.3 percent of the aircraft in Eighth's operational units and 17.5 percent of its crew strength. 141 By themselves these percentages explain why Eighth did not go back to Schweinfurt until the following October.

The size of the attacking force and dual targets reflect an overestimation of both the accuracy and effectiveness of bombing. 142 Thus, there was a tendency to underestimate the aircraft needed to destroy a target and to overestimate the damage inflicted. A second point has to do with the ineffectual cooperation between the British and American strategic bombing forces in England. Despite the friendship between Eaker and Harris, and Eighth Air Force's earlier cooperation in the assault on Hamburg on July 25 and 26th, Bomber Command headquarters showed no interest in supporting the precision bombing offensive by hitting at night what Eaker's forces had hit in the day. It is worth noting that the Air Staff's Director of Bombing Operations, Air Commander S.O. Bufton, was strongly urging in the summer of 1943 that Bomber Command follow up any American attack on Schweinfurt. He suggested that RAF crews be told that history might "prove that tonight's operation, in conjunction with the day attack which is taking place at this moment, will be one of the major battles of this war. If both operations are successful, German resistance may be broken and the war ended sooner than could be possible in any other way."143 But Harris had set his face against bombing any "panacea" target, and Eight Air Force went down the dark road to Schweinfurt twice in 1943-alone. The heavy losses that American bombers suffered in the summer directly reflected the insufficient range of escorting fighters. This was a result of Anglo- American attitudes that regarded the use of long-range fighter aircraft not only as technologically impossible but in some cases as not really necessary. As late as mid-June, even after the heavy losses on the Kiel raid, Eaker placed range extension tanks for fighters fourth on his list of priorities. In f

Jeschonnek and his staff had ignored the mess that Udet made of production and had as a result voiced no alarm about continued production stagnation as the Luftwaffe prepared to attack Russia. The growing gap between German and Allied production began to emerge in devastating form in the attrition battles of summer 1943. Since late 1942, Milch had indeed done wonders with German production. In 1943, the aircraft industry produced 64 percent more aircraft than in 1942, with a dramatic increase of 125.2 percent in fighter production and 31.4 percent in bombers. By May 1943, industry produced 1,000 fighters for the first time; by July, production reached 1,263.19% It was not enough. The attrition was such that for the first half of the year, there was a slow but steady increase in fighter and bomber strength. However, in July and August, despite production efforts, the number of aircraft in frontline units began to decline noticeably.

As one instructor put it in the early thirties: "A well-planned and well-conducted bombardment attack, once launched, cannot be stopped."'61 By 1935, the bombardment advocates were arguing that even if enemy pursuit possessed "overwhelming superiority in all factors influencing air combat, . . . escorting fighters will neither be provided nor requested unless experience proves that bombardment is unable to penetrate such resistance alone."62 There were, of course, factors that gave such a position greater validity in 1935 than in 1940: Without radar, air defense forces were at considerable disadvantage in finding and attacking bomber formations. Nevertheless, the line of argument within the school clearly implied that even should enemy fighters discover the attacking formations, the bombers could fight their way through to the target. It was not so much that bomber advocates rejected the concept of long-range fighter support for their formations, they simply assumed that such aircraft were not necessary and could not be built. In the late 1920's, there was some interest in such aircraft among pursuit supporters who suggested that with drop tanks and extended range, fighters could support bombers in deep penetration raids. 63 Nevertheless, in all fairness, one must note that in the 1930's, the few advocates of pursuit aviation were not enthusiastic about using fighters to escort bombers. One veteran of the school recalled that the foremost pursuit expert, the future General Claire Chennault, showed little interest in using fighters to escort bombers.64 America's geographic isolation a

The bombers and "Stukas" had proven as vulnerable to British fighter attack as they had over Dunkirk, while the Bf 110 proved unable to defend itself adequately against "Hurricanes" and "Spitfires." Only the Bf 109 showed itself equal to the "Spitfire" and superior to the "Hurricane." Thus, the single-engine fighter force had to provide protection to all bomber sorties and Bf 110 missions, as well as conduct its own campaign against Fighter Command. The helplessness of German bombers faced with British fighter opposition was reflected in Göring's early August directive that German fighters flying cover should stick close to the units they were protecting and not allow themselves to be deflected from their primary mission by the appearance of single enemy aircraft. 93 The air battles in mid-August underlined the weakness of the Luftwaffe's force structure. On August 15, RAF fighters based in central and northern England decimated German bombers and Bf 110's flying unescorted from Scandinavia and proved once and for all that unsupported daylight bomber operations against Britain were nearly impossible. RAF opposition in the north also disproved the German view that Dowding would concentrate his entire strength in the south to meet the air threat from across the Channel. In that area, the contest for air superiority lasted for a little over a month. Flying up to three sorties a day, the Bf 109 force could not be everywhere; and as bomber and Bf 110 losses mounted, the fighter squadrons unfairly came under criticism from Göring and his staff for insufficiently protecting the bombers.94 The fuel supply of the Bf 109 limited the arena within which the Luftwaffe grappled with Fighter Command, as well as the time that fighter formations could remain with the bombers.

However, no matter what the target's value, Eighth Air Force could not return until fighter escort could reach Schweinfurt. Harris, involved in his offensive against Berlin, had no intention of attacking a "panacea" target. By February, those conditions had changed; Eighth possessed fighter protection that could take it all the way to Schweinfurt, while Harris was more amenable to attacking ball bearings after the losses over Berlin.

Unfortunately, the development and production of suitable drop tanks involved considerable muddle, particularly in the United States. While some in Washington recognized the importance of range extension tanks, there existed a lack of communication between Eighth and procurement officials at home.

During the nine days from May 26 through June 3, the RAF lost 177 aircraft destroyed or damaged; the Germans lost 240.63 For much of the Luftwaffe, Dunkirk came as a nasty shock. Fliegerkorps II reported in its war diary that it lost more aircraft on the 27th attacking the evacuation than it had lost in the previous ten days of the campaign. 64 The destruction or forced evacuation of the entire Allied left wing in the Low Countries (consisting of the most mobile and best trained divisions) made the defense of France hopeless. Nevertheless, the remaining French forces put up a creditable defense in early June, suggesting what they might have accomplished with better leadership in May. Their hopeless military position made defeat quick and brutal. To a certain extent, the strategic collapse of the entire western position has obscured the significant attrition of German armored and air forces that took place during the fighting.

Only 17 bombers failed to return; but a second attack, later in the day, by Fifteenth received a severe mauling.

In the month's last week, however, excellent flying conditions occurred and Eaker mounted his most ambitious operations. Eighth attacked Hamburg on July 25 and again on the 26th (along with Hanover). On July 28 and 30th, the American bombers hit Kassel and assorted targets and on the 29th attacked Kiel and Warnemünde. These operations did not come lightly. Ferocious German opposition cost Eighth Air Force 87 bombers. 135 Despite the losses, these operations signalled the arrival of American fighters as a factor in the air battle. On July 28, P-47's, equipped for the first time with drop tanks, caught German fighters attacking B-17 stragglers; on the 30th, escort fighters again caught the Germans and inflicted heavy losses. While these first drop tanks only extended P-47 range by 30-plus miles, the presence of American fighters deeper on the continent portended serious implications for German defenses. 136 Extensive operations at the end of July exhausted and attrited Eighth's forces so that available strength fell below 300; not until August 12 did the Americans return to skies over the Reich. The attack on the Ruhr indicated no weakening of German opposition; 25 bombers out of 330 dispatched fell (a 7.5 percent loss rate). 137 On August 17, Eaker launched his bombers against Schweinfurt and Regensburg in one of the most famous and costly raids of the war. The latter attacks aimed at destroying the Messerschmitt complex-an obvious effort to strike at the source of Luftwaffe fighter strength. Within Schweinfurt, three major concerns produced 45 percent of the ball bearings used by German industry (52.5 percent in terms of net 171   ## p. 172 (#192) ############################################  STRATEGY FOR DEFEAT ESCORT FIGHTER RANGE O BE HIM)` รฐา พ 175 WITH DROPSTANK 20 MILES 230 MILES SPARTELAE KIEL BREMEN HANOVER HAMBUR BE

Bad weather, the low level of skill among new crews, and defensive fire from the bombers all took their toll. The worst enemy of night fighter crews seems to have been themselves. In a twelve-day period (March 15 to 26th), Nachtgeschwader 6 with two Gruppen (a total strength of between 50 and 60 aircraft) lost 6 aircraft that ran out of fuel, had 2 aircraft damaged by belly landings, and had 1 aircraft force-land in Switzerland. Only two aircraft were lost in combat. 53 Crew losses ran at a steady rate, close to 15 percent for the first three months of 1944.54 While such losses were not light, German crews gained the impression that they were inflicting serious damage on the enemy. Moreover, they were defending German cities from the British bombers, and as a result their loss rate was probably easier to bear. By spring 1944, the night defenses had won a substantial victory over their opponent. They had made the skies over the Reich so dangerous that the British could only infrequently risk the losses involved in deep penetration raids. What the Germans were not able to do, however, was to transfer their success to the skies over the occupied western countries.

The crushing of the attack and the very considerable losses will presumably limit American daylight activity for some time to the range of escort formations. 118 A sharp rise in Luftwaffe aircraft and crew losses immediately reflected the pressure that Allied day operations exerted on defending forces. In January 1944, the fighter forces wrote off 30.3 percent of their single-engine fighters and had lost 16.9 percent of their crews by month's end. 119 This high attrition of pilots resulted not only from combat operations but also from the continued dilution of the force by inexperienced, ill-trained pilots, who in winter's bad weather conditions were as dangerous to themselves as enemy fighters. One fighter Gruppe at month's end scrambled 21 aircraft for a second sortie at an American bomber formation. The Germans achieved two victories but had four aircraft missing, one crash landing (pilot killed), three pilots abandoning their aircraft by parachute, one aircraft damaged after a belly landing, and three aircraft crashing on takeoff. 120 On January 29, the III Gruppe of the Jagdgeschwader Udet claimed 12 bombers, but out of 28 German aircraft taking off, at least 5 and probably 6 were destroyed; 2 pilots were killed and 1 wounded while 3 parachuted to safety. 121 For the overall trends, Tables LI, 122 LII, 123 LIII, 124 and LIV 125. see At month's end, the Germans still believed that they need not worry about America

By early September, most of Luftflotte 3 was back on German airfields in utter disarray. Its new bases did not even have flak protection against Allied fighter sweeps. 127 Losses in the collapse in the west, particularly in aircraft, were high. The II Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 53 reported that it had lost 42 aircraft through enemy action, 18 more in noncombat accidents, 20 more abandoned and destroyed on airfields captured by the enemy, and a final 20 through other causes. All told, it had lost approximately 200 percent of its authorized strength in one month. 128 Overall in August 1944, Luftflotte 3 lost 482 fighters, while Luftflotte Reich lost an additional 375 Bf 109's and Fw 190's.

It chewed up whatever resistance the Germans managed to throw together. Unfortunately, the euphoria gripping Allied commanders and troops as they approached the frontier turned into overconfidence and a belief the war was won. Rightly, the Allies sensed that the Wehrmacht was teetering on the brink of a final collapse that could cause the end of the Third Reich. But that very sixth sense brought with it failure. 130 As overall commander, Eisenhower held responsibility for that failure-not because his strategy failed but because he was unable to control his subordinates. His personal qualities had enabled him to make the diverse and strong individuals in the Allied high command work together to accomplish the invasion. Those qualities, however, were not the qualities needed to dominate and drive that collection of strong personalities under tight leash, and a very tight leash was required to turn the rout in France into final victory.

The missing rate on six Berlin raids averaged 6.1 percent of sorties dispatched, while attacks on other cities lost 7.2 percent of their aircraft. The least costly raid was on Stettin. Nevertheless, even though the German controller was fooled into believing Berlin was the main attack, the raid still lost 4.2 percent of aircraft dispatched.26 Total bombers lost for the month came to 316 aircraft, a rate in terms of materiel and manpower that no air force could long support. 27 These losses reflected the German success in rebuilding the night defenses. New aircraft, new radar sets, and above all a new system of command and control tipped the balance against the bomber. As early as the end of September, General Schmid, now Commander of the I Jagdkorps (I Fighter Corps), felt that the "wild sow" tactics had reached their optimum and would not gain any greater success.2 Herrmann's system depended on a centralized control to give day fighters the location of the attack. During the fall of 1943, that control system evolved into a running commentary by the chief German controller as to the course and progress of the bomber stream. Meanwhile, "wild sow" and "tame sow" radar-equipped fighters scrambled. The controller vectored them to beacons located throughout Germany from which they could then move into the bomber stream. The fighter beacons for "wild sow" aircraft were flashing high-powered lights on the ground, while radio beacons provided concentration points for the twin-engine, radar- equipped fighters. Bad winter weather, however, made it possible to concentrate "wild sow" forces, as Schmid had suspected would be the case.2 28 The "tame sow" aircraft and the controllers became increasingly adept at earlier interception of raids and at feeding night fighters directly into the bomber stream. The development of a number of new devices aided the defense. The first step came with the use of British identification, friend or foe (I

In September, only one major raid penetrated deep into German airspace; the results duplicated what had happened over Schweinfurt in August. Forty-five bombers and crews were listed as missing out of 338 aircraft dispatched to attack the bearing and aircraft factories near Stuttgart.55 For the remainder of the month, Eighth licked its wounds and attacked the occupied districts of western Europe. There, Allied fighters kept bomber losses within tolerable limits. Meanwhile, the flow of aircraft and crews from the States swelled Eighth's groups: Its effective aircraft strength climbed over the 300 mark, while the number of available aircrews went over 400, both for the first time. 56 In October, the daylight air battle peaked, and American losses in deep penetration, unescorted raids ended illusions that bomber formations could protect themselves. Defeat over Schweinfurt sounded the death of prewar doctrine and the assumptions on which it had been built. Yet if October was a serious setback, the cost paid dividends. By carrying the war to Germany, the daylight bombers forced the Luftwaffe to come up and to fight. In the short run, bomber casualties reached unacceptable levels, but German fighter losses, relatively speaking, were even more costly as to their long-term effects. In essence, Eighth's operations imposed a high enough attrition rate to prevent the recovery of Germany's fighter arm after the losses suffered over the summer. Eighth's October operations began on the 8th with an attack on Bremen and Vegesack. The attacking formations lost 30 bombers with a further 26 receiving major damage. Three-quarters of the 1st Bombardment Division's aircraft received flak damage. This attack initiated a week of heavy operations culminating with a second great attack on Schweinfurt on October 14. On October 9, Eighth's bombers flying over Denmark and the Baltic hit Danzig and Marienburg, and a diversionary force hit the Arado factory at Anklam. Both the Arado works and
