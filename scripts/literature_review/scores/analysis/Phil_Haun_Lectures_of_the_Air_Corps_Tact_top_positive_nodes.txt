For example, if the necessary numbers of additional Primary Training type airplanes (4,195) can be added to those expected to be on hand (4,325  AWPD-1 243  plus 4,195 equals 8520) on February 15, 1942, it would be possible to start the expanded pilot training schools in operation on May 15, 1942. It would then be possible to man and to meet war time attrition on the Interim Expe- dient Air Force by November 1, 1943, without interfering with the 54 Group Program.

During the inter- war period a small cadre of airmen serving on the faculty of the Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) at Maxwell Field, Alabama, had articulated the con- cept of high-altitude daylight precision bombing (HADPB), a coherent yet controversial theory for victory through the independent employment of air forces. The ACTS instructors and their students would later be responsible for translating theory into practice in World War II. In so doing, the logic of HADPB was tested and in many ways found wanting as the advent of radar tilted the offense-defense balance toward the defenders, and the persistent clouds over Germany and Japan neutralized the potential lethality of high- altitude daylight precis

Prior efforts by the RAF to lure the Luftwaffe into the skies against similarly unfavorable odds had failed, as witnessed by the “Circus” daylight raids over northern France in 1940-1941. The difference in 1944 was that Eighth Air Force had the capabil- ity to penetrate deep and strike at the heart of Germany in the daylight. Con- sequently, these raids compelled Luftwaffe fighter pilots into the sky, under unfavorable odds, to fight and die.  As a result of US raids on Germany, by June 6, 1944, the skies over the beaches of Normandy were clear and, while Allied forces faced many chal- lenges conducting their amphibious landings, enemy air attack was not one of them.

The Germans concentrated roughly half of their synthetic oil production at four sites, and on two clear days in May 1944, Eighth Air Force successfully struck these and five other facilities. Fol- low-up HADPB raids throughout the summer markedly reduced German finished oil production by 42.6 percent.

In a series of air raids in the late summer and fall of 1943, Eighth Air Force successfully attacked factories in central Germany, but in the process suffered defeat as its bombers were overwhelmed by Luft- waffe fighters.

So our ratio of 150 against 100 modern bombers is certainly not unduly optimistic.  If our city is in the air alert zone it will require more airplanes in order to maintain that 1.5 to 1 superiority. Let us remember that in the air alert method we keep our airplanes in the air. Even the very thought of this method is fatiguing. Since the airplanes must be maintained and the pilots must get some rest, we may assume that it will take three airplanes and six crews to keep one airplane in the air continuously.

Unfortunately, the impact proved too little and too late to relieve the Soviets when they needed it the most, from the German invasion in June 1941 through the termination of the German offensive following Stalingrad in February 1943. The Luftwaffe did not begin to divert a significant num- ber of fighters for homeland defense until after the Battle of Kursk in July. Whereas there were twice the fighters on foreign soil as in Germany in June, by October the ratio was one-to-one. At this point, however, the Soviets had withstood the full brunt of the German invasion and were transitioning from defense to offense. Though additional Luftwaffe fighters would have been useful against the Soviet offensive, given the growing advantage in So- viet power, the most German air power could have been expected to achieve was to slow the Red Army advance.”  As for the German decision to divert flak guns, it was Bomber Com- mand, not Eighth Air Force, that was responsible. The Germans reinforced their defenses from 800 heavy flak batteries in 1940 to over 2,100 by 1943. By this time flak guns made up a quarter of all German weapons production and consumed 17 percent of German ammunition.* The 36,000 heavy and light AAA pieces defending the homeland were double the surface-to-air weapons deployed in other theaters.® By early 1943 Bomber Command had expanded to be able to conduct 1,000 bomber raids while Eighth Air Force was still struggling to get 100 aircraft airborne.” The Soviets indeed faced fewer guns on the Eastern Front than they otherwise would have, but this was thanks to Bomber Command's nighttime raids and not Eighth Air Force's high-altitude daylight precision bombing.  In addition to the diversion of fighters and flak guns, nearly a million personnel were required to operate the German air defense system.

The US Army, however, forced the Air Corps to buy the Douglas B-18 Bolo instead, a twin-engine bomber deemed more suitable for support- ing ground forces. Despite the setback, the Air Corps succeeded in procuring thirteen YB-17s designated as “test” aircraft. These aircraft formed a single squadron, which would remain the only B-17 squadron until production ramped up in 1939. By war's end, 12,700 B-17’s would be built.”  ‘The early B-17s had a crew of six although by World War II, the number of crew had expanded to 10. It had a top speed of 256 mph at 14,000 feet and a service ceiling of 30,000 feet. Its combat load was 4,000 pounds for long missions but could be adapted for shorter missions and larger loads by car- rying less fuel. For defense, the B-17 was initially armed with five 30-caliber machine guns, with 50-caliber guns added later.*!  By 1938, the Air Corps calculated that the B-17 mounted with the Norden bombsight had a mean error of 241 feet from 15,000 feet. This meant that half of the bombs could be expected to hit within a 241-foot radius of the target (combat experience would show these calculations to be overly optimistic).

German air operations ceased against London when losses built up to 14%.  We will use this figure of 10% as a basis for further discussion. If we glance at our chart, we believe that you will concur that the British could expect such 10% losses when a striking force formation was outnumbered about 1.5 to 1. Such a figure taken from this chart would mean that when a  106 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  British formation of nine DH's was attacked by fourteen German Albatrosses the British usually lost one airplane.  We have previously mentioned a tabulation that was made for data for the preparation of this chart. There are several interesting additional figures that may be quoted.  A total of 191 day missions were conducted on a true air offensive into Germany. A total of 1,641 airplanes invaded Germany to bomb German ob- jectives. This does not include the missions that were assigned in counter-air force operations against German airdromes. It does not include those forced to return because of engine trouble. An additional 228 airplanes could have bombed if engine trouble had not forced a return to the airdrome. This is a high percentage—17.5% of those that actually were exposed, and indicates the engine unreliability in 1918. We would not expect certainly such a percentage in any air operations that we would conduct in 1939. It includes only those which were exposed. Now, there were ninety-one bombers actually shot down in air combat. This is 5.5% of the number of bombers that started for an objec- tive and were not forced to return for any reason. There were, of course, many other British losses that we are not interested in—crashes, forced landings in friendly and in enemy territory due to navigation or engine trouble—only one airplane is reported shot down by antiaircraft artillery fire. We note from British reports that these defensive

In his conclusion, he attempted to insulate his claims from criticism by claiming his views were accepted by those “compe- tent to judge.” Though he does not name who those are, we are left with the impression that such competence resides with him and his bomber brethren alone.  Interestingly, Walker was largely proven right in World War II as the bomber formation almost always did get through. Even on the most in- famous raids in which US bombers suffered horrendous losses, such as at Schweinfurt and Regensburg, the bombers made it to the target. Walker, however, addressed only the effectiveness of a single bomber raid while ig- noring the question as to whether there would be sufficient aircraft available for subsequent strikes. The success of air operations was borne out by the cumulative effect of attacks over time, not on the outcome of a single raid. ‘The central question that Walker did not address, and which is considered in the next lecture, was whether a bomber formation could attack its target with an acceptable loss rate.  TACTICAL OFFENSE AND TACTICAL DEFENSE  Major Frederick Hopkins, in his 1939 lecture on “Tactical Offense and Tacti- cal Defense,’ addresses this critical issue of bomber attrition.‘ From the evi-  The Bomber Always Gets Through 99  dence of the British Independent Force's daylight air raids in World War I, Hopkins concludes that only when the ratio of pursuit to bombers exceeds 1.5 to 1 does the attrition rate become too high for sustained offensive op- erations. Hopkins argues that such a ratio would prove rare as the offense would inherently have the advantage over the defense as the offense chose the time and place of attack. The offensive could mass its force at the point of attack, while defenders, unaware of exactly when and where the point of attack would be, had to disperse its forces and wait. The concentration of of- fensive force would thus prevent the pursuit to bomber ratio from becom

Although it is not desired to consider in detail all points concerning the bombardment formation, it is believed that the discussion which follows will indicate sufficiently the features upon which the foregoing statements are predicated. First, the formation must be simple, compact and capable of ready control by the formation leader. It must be capable of maneuver and so flexible that distances and intervals between individual airplanes may be readily opened and closed. Its arrangement must be such that all angles of ap- proach by hostile aviation are well covered by defensive machine gun fire. In this connection, emphasis is placed upon a formation arrangement whereby the maximum fire may be concentrated against that angle most favorable to attack by single seater pursuit. The formation must be so flown that a simul- taneous attack by a superior number of hostile pursuit is difficult.  To meet these requirements, the normal formation consists of a number of three or five airplane elements. Within elements the airplanes are eche- loned rearward from the leading airplane to the right and left and slightly up- ward in altitude, forming a V. Each element flies to the rear of the preceding element. The elements are echeloned downward from front to rear. With such arrangement all areas enclosing the formation are well covered by machine gun fire. By the “staggered down” feature embodied in echeloning elements downward from front to rear, all rear gunners are provided with unblanketed fire to the upper rear hemisphere, which is the angle of approach most favor-  The Bomber Always Gets Through 91  able to the attack of hostile single seater pursuit. To appreciate the fact that approach from the upper rear hemisphere is most favorable to hostile pur- suit, consider the difficulties of the frontal or flank attack, or the attack from the lower rear hemisphere of a formation. In the frontal attack, the speed of approach of the pursuit is the sum of the speeds of the pursu

It indicates that the DH-9 with its single flexible ma- chine gun covering a quarter of the firing hemisphere could expect from zero to 20% losses when matched with an equal number of pursuit.  We should try to arrive at some general conclusion as to the pursuit nu- merical superiority in air combat that may make air force operations relatively unprofitable. Let me repeat that statement because much of our further dis- cussion rests upon this point.  Let us try to set up some kind of assumptions. It was the experience of the World War and is still the basis of our War Procurement Plans that an average airplane replacement rate of 30% a month will be needed to sustain the efforts of our Army Air Corps. We sincerely hope this figure is too high for the operations of a striking force but due to the lack of better values we shall accept it. The logistics tables of this school and adopted by the GHQ Air Force are built upon an expected average of two-thirds of a mission a day, or twenty missions per month, a figure which we may believe high but which we will also accept without discussion.  What do these figures mean? They mean that we must keep the average losses of all kinds in twenty missions in a month to less than 30% or else ex- ceed our replacement rate. These figures mean that whenever we exceed 1% average losses per mission of the total force we are exceeding our replacement rate. They mean that if on the twenty missions per month if we exceed 30% losses of the total force, future air operations must on the whole be cut down and we are jeopardizing the sustained effect of air force employment. It is rather obvious that if on any series of missions the entire striking force suffers more than 10% losses on each mission that air operations will soon be very seri- ously curtailed. German air operations ceased against London when losses built up to 14%.  We will u

In the nose of the fuselage extending forward of the leading edge of the wings, are placed the pilot, the bomber and the front gunner. In the rear portion of the fuselage are located the rear gunners. An alternate arrangement of rear gunners is to place them in the engine nacelles. By such an arrangement, excellent vision for the pilot and the bomber are af- forded. Flexibly mounted machine guns cover all areas open to the approach of hostile attacking aircraft. The airplane is equipped with radio telephone with which communications between airplanes may be maintained and for- mations controlled in flight. With the rapid advance of aeronautical develop- ment the above conception of the proper types of bombardment airplanes will be changed from time to time, when increased performance will make possible greater load and cruising range.  For purposes of discussion, bombardment tactics will be reviewed under the following headings:  90 LECTURES OF THE AIR CORPS TACTICAL SCHOOL  Day operations at high altitudes.  Day operations at low altitudes.  Night operations.  Special support by other classes of aviation.  Day Operations at High Altitude  In conducting day operations at high altitudes—meaning altitudes above ten thousand feet—a bombardment unit will normally perform a mission with its airplanes in formation. The formation lends itself to the delivery of a mass attack, to defensive machine gun fire superior to that which may be brought against it, and affords a measure of security against antiaircraft fire. That a mass attack is delivered from a formation is, of course, obvious. It is necessary, however, to investigate the types of formations adopted to under- stand their defensive powers when opposed to hostile pursuit and antiair- craft artillery.  Although it is not desired to consider in detail all points concerning the bombardment formation, it is believed that the discussion which follows will indicate sufficiently the features upon which
