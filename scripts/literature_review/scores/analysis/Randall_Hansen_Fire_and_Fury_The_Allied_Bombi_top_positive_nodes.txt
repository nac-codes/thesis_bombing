And the RAF did not follow up, not on August 18, August 19, or on any other night in 1943. "We barely escaped," Speer wrote, "a further catastrophic blow." Speer immediately got to work on recovering from Schweinfurt. He gave brief thought to relocating the factories, but moving them would have held up production for three to four months.29 He ordered his men instead to patch up Schweinfurt as best they could, and began to draw on Germany's reserves. Within eight weeks, those reserves were gone. The few ball bearings produced were carried-often in rucksacks-from what was left of the Schweinfurt factories to the assembly line each night.30 Each day, Speer listened for the bombers and worried about Berlin-Erkner, Cannstatt, and Steyr. "In those days we anxiously asked ourselves how soon the enemy would realize that he could paralyze the production of thousands of armaments plants merely by destroying five or six relatively small targets."3" Instead, the British "continued [their] indiscriminate attacks upon [German] cities."32 Imperial War Museum London No good deed goes unpunished.

It would have given fodder to Churchill and other enemies of precision bombing and strengthened the hand of those, such as Brereton, who opposed the concentration of power and authority in Spaatz's hands. As the evening wore on, group after group reported, and the story was always the same: they had losses of only one or two, many times none at all.22 The attacks had damaged four plants producing Luftwaffe night fighters/bombers (Ju 88s), and two others producing day fighter aircraft (Bf 109s).

He had commanded the United States Eighth Air Force, but he took over the Americans' North African campaign in November 1942, before they began bombing Germany. He returned to England to assume full command over U.S. air forces in Europe and to prepare for the invasion of the Continent. Spaatz worked with Sir Arthur Ted- der, General Eisenhower's chief deputy at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expe- ditionary Force (SHAEF). Spaatz was given overall command of a new organization, the United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USSTAF), which coordinated both the Eighth Air Force and the Fifteenth Air Force (U.S. heavy bombers based in Italy).

Over the course of the March 1944 raids, the Americans suffered terrible losses-153 bombers in just 3 raids-but they imposed equally terrible losses: 40 to 50 German fighters per raid. By the time the Americans paused, they had destroyed almost all of Germany's existing night fighters, seven hundred night fighters that were in production, and three-quarters of all manufacturing facilities.

In February 1944, Spaatz became a convinced advocate of new attacks on oil. As air attacks on the Luftwaffe produced early results, Spaatz ordered the formation of a USSTAF planning committee to consider future targets. With Spaatz urging them on, the committee produced a report on March 5. It called for combined RAF-American attacks on oil targets across Germany and into central Europe. If fourteen synthetic oil plants (which extracted oil from coal) and thirteen refineries could be destroyed, 80 percent of German production and 60 percent of readily usable refining capacity would be destroyed.

Although the raid was costly, it had inflicted a great deal of damage on German industry. A great deal, but not enough. Speer's frantic efforts to secure alternate sup- plies had not gone unnoticed. By the end of August, Swedish and Swiss sources were sending reports to England. Photo-reconnaissance revealed frenetic repairs at Schweinfurt itself. And ULTRA (intelligence secured using Enigma to decrypt German codes) revealed how worried the Germans were about a follow- up attack and how urgently they were building up their forces.42 Arnold told Eaker, "I know you'll get to it as soon as the weather permits."43 Curtis LeMay, for one, was ready to go. As Arnold and Eaker conferred in High Wycombe, Speer and Milch were at Rechlin am MÃ¼ritzsee, home of the Air Force Experimental Centre. Milch was presenting charts on American and German aircraft production. "What alarmed 133 us most," wrote Speer, "were the figures on the future increase in four-motored daylight bombers. If these figures were accurate, [the U.S. bombing] we were undergoing could be regarded only as a prelude."44 When asked how much Hitler and GÃ¶ring knew about the figures, Milch was incensed. He told Speer that he had been trying for months to get GÃ¶ring to accept an Air Ministry expert report on enemy armaments. GÃ¶ring refused to look at it.

Finally, by going through the police, he managed to get on the line one factory foreman who sketched a picture for Speer: a direct hit had shat- tered machinery, lit the oil baths, and sent fires racing through the buildings. His factory was hardly unique. Armaments production was down 67 percent, almost twice that of the earlier raid.5Â° In the darkest hours after the raid, as the Amer- icans were reeling from the loss of sixty bombers, Eaker had bravely told Arnold that "we are convinced that when the totals are struck yesterday's losses will be far outweighed by the value of the enemy materiel destroyed."51 He was right. Imperial War Museum London Speer adapted to the crisis quickly. He appointed one of his closest associates, Phillip Kessler (a general manager from industry), as special commissioner for ball bearings production. They managed to import small quantities of ball bearings from Sweden and Switzerland. Factories were ordered to substitute slide bearings for ball bearings. Speer was able to keep production going, though at a sharply reduced level, until the Schweinfurt factories were repaired. His actions were not, however, decisive.

But, two nights later, the 100th Squadron was back, blazing exactly the same trail across Germany. At Drummer Lake, in northern Germany and the scene of the majority of the 100th's losses, the first wave of escort fighters, Thunderbolts, turned away.

As he inspected the Sorpe Valley reservoir, his fears were confirmed. The centre of the dam had taken a direct hit. The hole was just above water level. Had it been a few inches lower, the pressure of the water would have swept the dam away. With the two successful hits, the RAF "with just a few bombers [nineteen] . . . came close to a success which would have been greater than anything they had achieved hitherto with a commitment of thousands of bombers."10 The RAF had made one mistake: the Eder Valley dam had nothing to do with the water supply to the Ruhr. Still, Speer's relief that three dams were still standing was marred by a gnawing fear: when would the British be back? They wouldn't.

Reducing the number of bombers was safe, but it came at a price: the lousy autumn weather reduced the number of raids to a handful, and a small bomber stream would lead to limited dam- age. Spaatz decided to risk it all. On November 27, he picked a fight with the Luftwaffe. One thousand American bombers left England in two groups. The first was made up of 515 heavy bombers, escorted by 241 fighters. It raided mar- shalling yards in southern Germany. The second, composed of 460 planes, headed for oil centres in northern and central Germany. The idea was to trick the Germans into thinking that the fighter force was in fact bombers. It worked. The Luftwaffe attacked the fighter formation, leaving the bombers relatively unimpeded. The American fighters countered viciously. They shot down ninety-eight enemy fighters-double the average of the spring raids-at the cost of twelve of their own.

"On that day" he wrote, "the tech- nological war was decided. ... Until then," he continued, "we had managed to produce approximately as many weapons as the armed forces needed, in spite of their considerable losses. But with the attack of [the American daylight bombers] upon several fuel plants in central and eastern Germany, a new era in the air war began. It meant the end of German war production." 28 On May 13, Speer accompanied some technicians on a visit to the Leuna works. Stepping across broken and twisted pipes, he received a report on the damage. The chemical plants had proven "extremely sensitive to bombing." By  178 | FIRE AND FURY Germany's Achilles beel the most optimistic forecasts, production could not be resumed for weeks. Daily output dropped by 1000 metric tons: from 5850 to 4820.

They screamed loudly at first, then grew quiet, gurgled, and died. Some followed Heidenkampsweg north or south, past the burning buildings and falling debris. Those who were not crushed by falling buildings made for canals running parallel to the east-west streets. They jumped in and were cooked to death. The water was boiling. The fires in buildings on either side of the street merged into one and began moving in search of oxygen. The entire neighbourhood was in flames. The bomb- ing that night was unusually concentrated. The pathfinders marked the neigh- bourhood with uncommon precision, and there was little "creepback" (which occurred when bombers dropped their bombs before they reached the aiming point). The weather was atypically hot by Hamburg's standards (the city's weather is roughly similar to that of England), and had been so for days. It was 30 degrees Celsius in the early evening and humidity was extremely low. Hamburg had expe- rienced one of largest raids of the war two nights earlier, and the city's Gauleiter (regional head) had ordered the firefighters to concentrate all of their efforts on putting out the fires. The headquarters of the fire brigade was located at the Berliner Tor, but it had dispatched the fire trucks to other parts of the city. As a result, they were on the wrong side of Hamburg when the bombing began and had to fight their way back through bomb craters, abandoned cars, and rubble. When they finally arrived in Hammerbrook, it was too late. They could only combat fires on the neighbourhood's periphery, and most of their efforts were directed toward helping the victims. The fire itself raged unchecked. 9 Somewhere in the middle of Hammerbrook, the flames converged with unimaginable force. As they did so, a chain reaction began: the intense heat led the fires to rise quickly, leaving a gas bubble below. Cold air then rushed in, mixing with the gases and setting the "bubble" ali

He had flown his first mission the day before, as part of an American raid on the le Bourget airport at Paris. As the bombing formation came toward the tar- get, a small number of fighters turned on them. As they opened machine gun fire, the wings lit up, and looked like long neon tubes. The formation blasted past the fighters with no difficulty. "We were young and confident," Wilbur observed six decades later, "and I thought, This is a piece of cake." Schweinfurt would be anything but. At Eupen, Wilbur watched the P-47 escort fighters turn away. They were on their own. Almost immediately, pilots in the leading aircraft made out black dots coming toward them, seemingly straight on. They were German Luftwaffe fighters, dozens of them, bearing down on the B-17s. Within seconds, the Germans were all over them. They flew straight at the Americans, all guns blazing. Out for blood, the fighters attacked | 127 mercilessly. They fired upside down. They fired as they did mid-air rolls, bearing down on the B-17s. American pilots saw dozens of aircraft sailing right at them and then, at the last second, diving and shooting past. "I witnessed," a waist gunner in the 384th Bomb Group later reported, "something that mankind will never see again . . . a parachute invasion of Germany. There were planes in flat spins, planes in wide spins. Planes were going down so often that it became useless to report them."20 The attacks would come in waves, every ten minutes or so. A group of fighters would finish their attack, land to refuel, and come back up again. "They kept coming and coming and coming," reported one navigator, "and we still had miles to go before the target."21 The bombers pressed on. Ineffectively trying to dodge the incoming fight- ers, they absorbed round after round of bullets from the front and flak from below. Flaming bombers fell away on all sides. By the time they reached the city's three ball bearings factories, thirty-two bombers ha

When the heat of the fire became unbearable, I shouted, "GET OUT!" four or five times as loud as I could. Then I jettisoned the cockpit canopy and went out myself. It was not easy; I found out later that my left thigh had been hit by a bullet and the bone was broken. As Peter flew through the air, the crashing machine's tailplane caught him. His stomach was flat against it, his head over its top, and his feet underneath. The angle of the plane meant that he was pinned between the tailplane and the force of the air. For a few minutes, he was trapped there, hurtling toward the ground. He thought he was finished. His plane was coned, and he expected to be strafed by a round of what we now call friendly fire. In fact, the searchlight commander below had recognized Peter's plane as a Messerschmitt and hoped the searchlight would help him. Somehow, Peter managed to free himself from the tailplane, pulled his chute, and passed out. He landed unconscious in the garden of Grunewalddamm, 69. As he woke up, he felt dull pain all over his body. He looked up to see a crowd of civilians and an SS man. They had mistaken him for an RAF airman and were beating him. He shouted at them in German and they stopped.8 143 The defence technique employed by Peter and the other fighters was called "Wilde Sau" (wild boar), and it was the brainchild of Hajo Herrmann. Incredi- bly, Herrmann had never been in a fighter plane; he was a bomber pilot with a long string of operations over the United Kingdom.9 By early 1943, he had a staff appointment with the Luftwaffe, and he worked on strategies to counter the mounting effectiveness of Harris's bombing campaign. Even before Ham- burg, it was clear that the Kammhuber Line was not working; fighter pilots would pick off a few bombers as the bombing stream flew past, but the major- ity of planes always made it past. When Herrmann was surveying German defence capabilities, two things stood out.10 The first
