Goering relied on information from his chief of intelligence, Josef Schmid. It was this source that was largely responsible for creating Goering’s own massive over-confidence in the superiority of his air force. In his report issued in mid-July on comparative British and German strength Schmid concluded that ‘the Luftwaffe is clearly superior to the RAF as regards strength, equipment, training, command and location of bases’. German air intelligence credited Britain with an aircraft output of only 180-300 first-line fighters a month and 150 first-line bombers and assumed that under conditions of war these figures would decrease rather than increase.132 This margin of error was significant. Actual British fighter production in July was 496, in August 476, in September 467. Overall production rose from 1,279 (all types) in May to 1,601 in August.

Air plans laid down for the period from January 1944 to August 1945 called for a total output of 97,000 aircraft. Economic restrictions reduced the plan to 66,000 and in the end only 40,000 could be produced, most of the aircraft being light fighters. The major bottleneck proved to be engine production. Over the same period only 56,000 engines were produced instead of the planned 105,000 and the ratio of engines to airframes produced fell from 2.3:1 in 1941 to 1:1 in 1945.37!

The RAF, on the other hand, had the main task of breaking up and dispersing bomber formations and was expressly forbidden to take up major combat with enemy fighters.

Moreover the very strategy of overwhelming an air force in a single ‘battle’ betrayed the Luftwaffe’s failure to grasp that air superiority could not be absolute against a well-armed enemy with large economic resources, a fact that had been widely misunderstood amongst the pre-war air powers. It was impossible under the conditions of the summer of 1940 for the Luftwaffe to eliminate the RAF because it lacked the operational and material means to destroy the British aircraft industry — in fact air attacks spurred on the industrial effort — or to prevent the RAF from regrouping again for renewed combat over the contested area. Poor German intelligence coupled with a complete lack of urgency in the question of production and repair had a crucial part to play in the failure of the Battle of Britain. Douhet’s contention that air command could be considered won when one side was forced on to a permanent defensive in air warfare was finally confounded. The Luftwaffe was, of course, able to inflict heavy losses on the RAF in both pilots and aircraft. Lack of combat training and the inadequacy of early British fighter tactics contributed to this. But it should be remembered that the RAF sustained higher losses in the seven weeks of the Battle of France than in the whole period of the Battle of Britain. In many ways the battles in May and June were more critical for the survival of the RAF than the attacks in August and September 1940.

Given such success it was even more remarkable that Hitler failed to divert more effort to expanding air defences during the period when the CBO was in abeyance in late 1943. But instead resources continued to be sucked into army support in Russia and Italy leaving the Luftwaffe frustrated in its efforts to construct a more general air strategy around the defence of the Reich. When the Allies introduced the long-range day and night fighters, a move which the Luftwaffe had already anticipated, the balance swung back firmly in favour of the Allied air forces since so little had been done in the interval in the way of strengthening German defences.317 Combined with a policy of large-scale production and a lead in radar technology air superiority passed to the Allies even over Germany itself. While Galland and Milch insisted on the need for a three- or fourfold numerical advantage of defending over attacking aircraft, the Luftwaffe command was forced to accept Goering’s verdict that the long-range Allied fighters were simply short-range fighters that had drifted with the westerly wind.2!8 As a result Goering continued to insist that the primary task of the fighters was still to break up the bomber formations and to ignore the escort fighters. This was, of course, a quite correct view in a situation where the Allies possessed no long-range fighter and the Germans large numbers of fighters; but since neither was in fact the case the delusions of the Luftwaffe commander-in-chief postponed for even longer the establishment of a satisfactory defence strategy to cope with Allied attacks.

The consequence was that as Allied fighters penetrated further into the Reich, the German fighters were never able to get close enough to the bombers in enough strength to inflict a high loss rate, let alone to break the formations up. The weakness of the Luftwaffe in the west was thus compounded of a lack of strategic priority and direction on the one hand, and tactical uncertainty on the other.#12 While Hitler himself predicted in September 1943 that the mastery of the air would be regained for Germany in ‘two to three months’,3?° the Luftwaffe generals saw that the air war had a quite different character. Even the pause in the Allied air offensive, and the reasons for it, were not fully appreciated on the German side. For the Luftwaffe there were permanent difficulties to be overcome. The crucial years in the build-up of Luftwaffe strength had been in 1940-42. The multiplication of tasks and the insufficiency of resources from these years had inflicted weaknesses that could not be overcome later in the war. The loss of initiative had produced an unbalanced air force as the bomber programme had to be cut back progressively in favour of fighters.32!

As it was the situation of regular battle attrition that set in from June onwards was precisely the sort of situation that the Luftwaffe needed to avoid. The Russians were particularly anxious to conserve where possible and deliberately put up a weak defence in some places in the knowledge that a particular area or battle was not likely to be decisive. Even by the end of July the Luftwaffe was reduced to 1,045 serviceable machines on the whole of the eastern front.122 By December this was reduced to 500 machines.

Allied bombing of economic targets was much more successful than the earlier experiences of bombing against good defences had suggested. The political consequences, although never approaching the collapse of war-willingness that Allied air commanders sought, nevertheless contributed to the self- inflicted elements in the decline of the Luftwaffe. Bombing finally destroyed Hitler’s confidence in his air forces, encouraging him to assume more of the operational control himself and to turn the Luftwaffe even more towards a tactical support role in the east.

The Luftwaffe was never able to build up a large enough offensive air force to be able to go back to the initiative and the production of a balanced air force designed to achieve air supremacy. The large new production of fighters in 1943 and 1944 made little difference to the situation, first of all because the loss rate had become too high by 1943, secondly because of the rapid deterioration in the training and number of crews available.

The new fighters, Yak-1, MiG-3 and LaGG-3, were technically a significant improvement on the I-153 and I-16 and they were produced in large quantities in the early months of the campaign. In the period up to June some 1,946 were produced. From July to December some 5,173 of the new fighters were produced. These figures compared very favourably with the 1,619 Luftwaffe fighters produced over the same period for all fronts, or even the 4,408 produced for the RAF. These fighters were supported in addition by the new II-2 ground-attack aircraft of which 1,293 were produced in the second half of 1941 and which proved to be a very effective dive-bomber kept in production for almost the whole of the war. The bulk of the very many Russian aircraft destroyed in June 1941 were therefore already obsolete, the Luftwaffe simply completing ajob that was already being carried out by the Red Air Force itself. For the later desperate defence of Moscow and around Smolensk the Russians were able to call on largely new types produced at the rate of four aircraft for every one German.188  For the early stages of the war in the east the supply situation did not, admittedly, seem critical for the Luftwaffe. The air force did exactly what was expected of it. Huge numbers of Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground. German estimates claimed the destruction of 4,017 Russian aircraft in the first week of operations. The Russians themselves admitted total losses of 5,316 by 5 October.182 Having achieved initial mastery over the frontier area Luftwaffe units were sent to help the main army offensives and in particular the central and southern fronts. The Luftwaffe did not regard Soviet air tactics as more than rudimentary. Hitler’s gamble appeared to have paid off. By October an apparently demoralized and ineffective Red Air Force could do

By January 1944 this had risen to 13,500 combat aircraft, by January 1945 to 15,500. The major drive on the Baltic front was supported by 7,000 Russian aircraft; that in the northern Ukraine by 2,800; and the final assault on Berlin and central Germany by a massive air army of 8,000 aircraft.231 Against these forces the Luftwaffe was able to offer only token resistance with dwindling resources. The reforms in organization and supply initiated by Milch in 1941 had come too late to affect the battles of 1943. What new production there was was needed for the defence of the Reich. Such defence had now become a major priority in order to keep the army fighting at all and out of sheer necessity the east was starved of the most modern equipment or the necessary replacements. Even the new tank destroyer aircraft, the Hs 129, equipped with the new armour-piercing cannon had to be sacrificed to efforts to keep the bombers at bay. Only 400 of them were produced in 1943 and 200 in 1944 even though its value had already been proved in the Kursk battles.232 In order not to disturb production programmes any further, older types like the Ju 87 ‘Stuka’ were kept in production. The medium-bomber programme which had been designed initially to give a powerful striking force on the eastern front against Russian troop concentrations had to be run down in favour of fighters. Because the strategic initiative in the air now lay with the attacker it made it difficult for the Luftwaffe to produce the kind of aircraft needed for Germany herself to carry out offensives, thus further disrupting chances of gaining a balanced aircraft production plan — a situation not unlike that facing Britain in the summer of 1940 when Beaverbrook’s rapid expansion of fighter output seriously delayed the programmes for other aircraft types.

The diversion of sufficient heavy aircraft from bombing Germany to bombing German naval targets and for patrolling purposes, while it led to a reduction in the bombing attacks on Germany itself, provided a weapon against which the German navy and air force were themselves ill-prepared. The same was true of the introduction of escort carriers. An ambitious carrier programme was begun when it was realized that aircraft would be needed to help protect the large convoys. They were brought into operation from September 1941 and within a short period of time eliminated the threat from the Kondor aircraft which had no long-range supporting aircraft to give them protection.1© In response to these changes in organization and weapons the German navy demanded throughout 1941 that the Luftwaffe provide more assistance in mine-laying and in general support of naval operations. The stumbling block to this policy was not a shortage of resources, as Goering argued, but the fact that Goering would not relinquish control over the Luftwaffe in the way that operational control over Coastal Command in direct support of naval activity had been granted in March 1941. Since Hitler agreed with Goering over the question of indivisibility and since Goering gave little credence to the view that the air war at sea could achieve anything decisive, the German navy was starved of resources that might otherwise have been used to great effect in the spirit of Hitler’s rather hollow directive ‘to concentrate all the weapons of air and sea warfare a

In 1943 the increase in strength failed to match the increases produced by Germany’s enemies. By 1944 the so-called ‘Production Miracle’ of the Fighter Staff evaporated because of the ease with which Allied fighters and bombers were able to destroy aircraft on the ground or at the factories. During 1944 losses of fighter aircraft rose to 73 per cent of strength per month.32? The higher the initial loss rates, the longer it took to build up sufficient stocks for future operations. Hitler’s own attitude towards reserves made the task of conserving strength even harder. The effects of the increase in production, although a cause of anxiety and some surprise for Allied intelligence, were quickly dissipated because of the vast numerical superiority enjoyed by the Allies and the failure of either Hitler or Goering to create a workable air strategy. The shortage of aircraft was also accompanied by a growing shortage of crews. Test-pilots and training instructors had been drafted to the front for emergency operations in 1941. By 1944 the time devoted to training German pilots had fallen to less than half the time at the beginning of the war anda third of the time devoted to training an RAF pilot.323 The loss rate among German pilots, particularly heavy on the eastern front, rose from an average of 615 per month before June 1941, to 1,167 per month between June 1941 and December 1943, and 1,755 in 1944.324 Allied loss rates were high too, but the Allies benefited from being able to draw on the resources of all the United Nations.  One consequence of the long period of fighting with inadequate resources against well-armed air enemies was the deterioration in German morale. Air officers lacked confidence in their superior commanders; so much so that many tactical novelties were introduced at the front without being referred back to the aut
