The RAF had 1,032 ﬁghter aircraft on August 9, with 768 serviceable. In addition, there were 424 in store ready for operations the next day. Throughout the three months of the air battle, from August to October 1940, the number of trained pilots on hand for RAF Fighter Command exceeded the number of single-seat ﬁghter pilots available on the German side. 10British numbers remained roughly constant over the period of the battle (despite a marginally higher loss rate than the Germans), but by early September, with the battle at its height, German numbers fell to around 500 ﬁghters and on October 1 fell for one day to only 275. The key to this difference lay in aircraft production. British industry was geared to produce ﬁghters as a top priority. German industry produced a wide range of tactical aircraft and more medium bombers than ﬁghters. In August and September 1940, the German aircraft industry produced 775 ﬁghters, the British industry 1,900. 11 The outcome was nevertheless not entirely preordained. German ﬁghters were of high quality and the pilots well trained and experienced. They were also able to choose the point of engagement, while the defending air force had to anticipate enemy operations and engage in the space of the enemy’s choosing. As a result, RAFFighter Command suffered a marginally faster rate of loss than the German ﬁghter arm, even though it had more substantial reserves and replacements. German advan-tages were nevertheless outweighed by some substantial disadvantages. German pilots were lost to the force once they were forced to bail out over enemy territory or crashed in the sea; German ﬁghter aircraft had to protect the bombers and were less free to engage in direct ﬁghter-to-ﬁghter combat; and German air intelligence persistently overestimated the British loss rate and level of damage to the air force infrastructure.

During the summer of 1943, the Red air force was able to deploy up to ten thousand frontline aircraft; the German air force had thirty-ﬁve hundred combat-ready aircraft on all fronts in the summer of 1943, but only eighteen hundred to two thousand on the entire Easternfront—including just six hundred ﬁghter aircraft, most of which were deployed in unequal combat over the battleﬁeld at Kursk in July 1943. In the opening phase of this battle, the German air force had only 700 ﬁghters and ﬁghter-bombers against 2,170 for the Red air force, which could also draw on substantial reserves positioned close behind the battle. In July and August, the German air ﬂeets lost 1,272 aircraft around Kursk and in the retreat that followed. This high loss rate was largely owing to the inability of attenuated German air forces to prevent the enemy from operating heavy attacks against air bases and supply or from using its larger number of ﬁghters to maintain local air superiority. 39 The operational ﬂexibility and concentration of force characteristic of the early years of German victories were lost in the face of a vastly larger force and high levels of force attrition. As a result of German weakness, Soviet loss rates fell from 34 percent of combat aircraft in 1942 to 14 percent in 1944, even though poor handling and training still resulted in very high noncombat losses.

The navy enjoyed operational control over long-range aircraft (almost all of them converted heavy bombers) assigned to RAF Coastal Command for work over the Atlantic approaches. But in the spring of 1942 there were far too few of them, and Bomber Command resisted the allocation of more bombers to the naval war because of the demands of the bombing campaign against Germany. This argument, too, could be resolved only at the highest level. In August 1942, Prime Minister Winston Churchill established an Anti–U-Boat Warfare Committee that, with his backing, insisted that more long-range aircraft be converted to an antisubmarine role. TheB–24 Liberators that were capable of covering the Atlantic Gap were made available only in March 1943, and by the summer there were 37 with Coastal Command and 209 serving with the U.S. Navy. 28 The conduct of operations also caused friction between the Allies, since the U.S. Navy commander in chief, Admiral Ernest King, wanted to retain control of his part of the Atlantic war and opposed any suggestion of a uniﬁed command of the antisubmarine war. The ﬁrst Liberators operating with Coastal Command were loaned by the USAAF , whose role King also distrusted. 29 In the end, the friction did not seriously jeopardize the Atlantic campaign, which ﬁnally turned in the Allies’ favor in March 1943 thanks to a range of important tactical and operational innovations—the introduction of ﬂexible naval “support groups” to attack the submarines around the convoys, the use of new centimetric radar (and in particular the new generation of EBSCOhost - printed on 10/12/2024 9:39 AM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

The attacks forced German ﬁghters to engage in air combat at the very limit of their range, while the bombers were easy prey for the faster and heavily gunned British ﬁghters. By the time the campaign petered out at the beginning of October, the German air force had lost 1,733 aircraft versus 915 for the RAF . Bythis time, Hitler had decided to postpone Sealion indeﬁnitely. All preparations were scaled down after September 19. The failure to secure air supremacy was a central explanation for this decision, though not the only one. Despite extensive preparations and training, the German navy could not guarantee the success of a difﬁcult cross-channel operation that would be under attack from British naval forces and by RAFBomber Command. 13 The third phase of the air assault on Britain was an attempt by the German air force to mount an independent strategic campaign to use demoralizing attacks on trade, shipping, industrial production, and communications to force Britain out of the war. This approach represented not only a clear break with German objectives of the summer and autumn of 1940, but also the onset of a campaign for which the air force had not been prepared.

The RAF launched the Battle of Berlin in the autumn of 1943, but loss rates rose to 14 percent of the attacking force destroyed or seriously damaged. The last raid, on March 24, 1944, cost 10 percent of the force destroyed, and a further raid on Nuremberg on March 30 saw the destruction of 11 percent. Harris admitted to the Air Ministry in London that these loss rates could not be sustained for long. The U.S. Eighth Air Force also suffered debilitating losses in the autumn of 1943, most famously during a raid on October 14, 1943, against the ball-bearing plants at Schweinfurt, which cost 60 bombers destroyed and 138 damaged out of a force of 300. 66The USAAF then suspended further deep raids into Germany. The solution was to ﬁnd ways of contesting German air forces over German territory, the problem that had faced the German air force over Britain in 1940. During the winter of 1943–1944, the Eighth Air Force planned a concentrated assault on German aircraft production (Operation Argument), which took place in the weeks starting February 20, 1944. The 3,800 bombers of the U.S. Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces and 2,351 RAF bombers dropped 20,000 tons of munitions on the German aircraft production sector, delaying two months of ﬁghter production and forcing the dispersal of much German production underground or to more distant sites.

The high losses from daylight raids forced the German air force to shift to night bombing, as the RAF had already done earlier in 1940. Losses from antiaircraft ﬁre and the ﬁrst nightﬁghter squadrons of the RAF were small in relation to the effort made, but German success rested on effective navigation, an advantage sustained until British scientiﬁc intelligence experts correctly interpreted the nature of the electronic beams and devised countermeasures in November 1940. This began a four-year electronic battle between the two sides to keep one step ahead in navigational and radar technology, an early ancestor of the electronic battleﬁelds of the late twentieth and early twenty-ﬁrst centuries. 20The campaign also revealed the importance of carrying a mixed armament, combining high-explosive with incendiary bombs, as well as aerial mines, which had a powerful destructive effect; 4,729 of them were dropped between September 1940 and May 1941. The proportion of incendiaries used rose over the course of the attacks: between September and December 1940, incendiaries made up 6.2 percent of the bomb tonnage dropped; between January and May 1941, they made up 12.8 percent. 21 A number of factors limited what the Blitz could achieve. In the ﬁrst place, there was no clear pattern to the attacks, except for the continued assault on Britishtrade and dock areas, which was designed to complement the growing submarine campaign. The absence of clear strategic objectives betrayed the improvised nature of the campaign and the political motives that sustained it. In addition, the operations were inhibited not only by poor weather but also by the relatively small bomb loads that the standard medium bombers—the Heinkel He–111, Dornier Do–17, and Junkers Ju–88—were capable of carrying.

The German ﬁghter force did what the RAF had done in the Battle of Britain, exacting an escalating toll against the large unescorted U.S. bomber streams that stretched across northern and central Germany, though generally without preventing the bombers from dropping their payload, however inaccurately. Both Allied bomber forces were compelled to adjust their tactics to take account of German defense and the difﬁculty of ﬁnding and hitting even close to the designated target in the face of unpredictable weather, heavy antiaircraft ﬁre, and German deception operations. The tactical performance of the bomber force was enhanced by improved aluminized explosive, new navigational aids—the radio navigation system Gee, in-troduced in 1942, and the air-to-ground radar, known as H2S—and the introduc-tion of special groups (Pathﬁnders in the RAF) to precede the bombers and to illuminate or indicate the target area clearly.

It is nevertheless evident that the battle could have been won sooner and at lower cost if the air effort had been properly appreciated and the resources made available. THE AIR WAR ON THE EASTERN FRONT While the German bombers kept up a relentless series of attacks in May 1941—including over seven hundred tons of bombs dropped on London on the night of May 10–11—the German air force prepared for the major campaign in the East. Thewar against the Soviet Union required the air force to conduct an operational air war alongside the ground offensive as it had in 1939 and 1940, using a combination of ﬁghter activity to win air superiority over the front and ﬁghter-bomber and medium-bomber attacks on the enemy air organization, battleﬁeld targets, and rear areas of supply and reinforcement. On June 21, 1941, the German air force deployed 3,664 aircraft (2,815 combat-ready) for the invasion. 30Opposing the Germans were an estimated ten thousand Soviet aircraft, with perhaps as many as eight thousand concentrated on the western frontier. Soviet aircraft were of mixed quality, many of them obsolete or obsolescent, but a new generation of high-quality ﬁghters, the Yak–1, MiG–3, and LaGG–3, were appearing in small numbers, as was the Il–2 “shturmovik” ﬁghter-bomber.

The improvements in maintenance also relied on a new system of air bases, with small, often improvised ﬁelds near the front and a series of larger and better resourced bases at safer distances (forty to sixty kilometers) from the front line. By force of circumstance, the Soviet armed forces constructed a ﬂexible oper- ational air force that was used to maximize the impact of the large ground armies in the major offensives conducted from 1943 onward. Aircraft were used principally to achieve temporary air superiority over the battleﬁeld area through strikes against enemy airﬁelds and ﬁghter aircraft and secondly to provide massive aerial ﬁrepower in tactical attacks on or near the battlefront—the form of operational air warfare exploited by the German air force in 1939–1941. The ﬁrst point at which these operational and command reforms were used with great effect was at Stalingrad,where Novikov organized an aerial blockade combining regular ﬁghter interception of enemy combat and transport aircraft with heavy tactical bombing attacks on German airﬁelds and troop concentrations. German Air Fleet Four was decimated during the siege at Stalingrad, with 488 aircraft destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Of the 624 aircraft remaining on the German southern front in Russia, only 240 were operational when Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus surrendered on January 31, 1943. The German effort to supply the Sixth Army from the air had also cost the German transport arm dearly: 266 Junkers Ju–52 transport aircraft were lost, one-third of the force, while a further 222 bombers converted to a transport role were also destroyed. 38 For the German air force in the East, the size of the front and the failure to expand aircraft production to match the scale of its demands made it difﬁcult to maintain an effective operational air war. Although German pilots occasionally were able to win local air superiority when there were sufﬁcient numbers of combat-worthy

The operational air war launched in the summer of 1941 gave way to a situation in which the air force became “the ﬂying artillery of the army,” conﬁned to battleﬁeld interdiction and increasingly limited in its efforts to combat Soviet ﬁghter aviation and to bomb more distant targets. 33The demands made on the transport units to supply trapped pockets of German troops at Demyansk and other areas, most famously Stalingrad, eroded the capacity of the German air force to undertake extensive transport operations. Moreover, unlike Soviet air forces, the German air force was compelled to keep a signiﬁcant part of its establishment elsewhere, in Western and Southern Europe. On the eve of Barbarossa, there were approximately 1,800 aircraft in other theaters, including 861 in Air Fleet Three opposing the RAF and 423 aircraft in the Mediter-ranean and North African theaters. 34By the autumn of 1943, some 60 percent of the ﬁghter force was defending the German homeland; a year later, it was around 80 percent. These other fronts absorbed between one-third and one-half of German air strength over the period 1941 to 1944. Only a very large increase in aircraft output could have compensated for ﬁghting air wars on three fronts, but in 1942, only 15,409 new aircraft were produced. In 1943, the number was 24,807, around two-thirds of the number produced by the Soviet Union alone, and a mere 16 percent of the total produced by the three major Allies. 35 By contrast, the Soviet Union moved from static army-based aviation in 1941 to a ﬂexible operational air war closely modeled on German practice. The principal organizer of this transition was a young air force lieutenant general, Alexander Novikov, whom Josef Stalin appointed Red Air Force commander in chief in April 1942. 36The divisional air units were scrapped and instead grouped into air armies (the equivalent of the German air ﬂeets) with mixed components of bombers, ﬁghter-bo

As a result, they lost command of the air and the land campaign simultaneously. 8 THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN AND THE BLITZ The most signiﬁcant air battle of the European war followed the defeat of France in June 1940. The Battle of Britain was regarded on the British side as a campaign to prevent a German invasion. As such, it involved not just Fighter Command but also extensive military preparations for the home-based army and the use of bomber aircraft to attack German-controlled ports and the shipping intended for OperationSealion, the proposed German invasion of Britain authorized by Adolf Hitler on July 16, 1940. Both sides, however, recognized that air superiority would be essential for the complex combined operation planned by the German high command. TheGerman air force commander in chief, Reich Marshal Hermann Göring, undertook to neutralize the RAF to the point where it could no longer intervene in the battle, at which stage German bombers would attempt to degrade the British military and economic structures in southern Britain to permit an invasion of the southern counties of Sussex and Kent. 9 Although the aerial Battle of Britain is usually dated from mid-July, the preliminary bombing began in June 1940, and there was almost continuous, if limited, air combat until the onset of the major air force assault against the RAF , which was scheduled to begin on “Eagle Day,” August 13, 1940. The Battle of Britain illuminated the difference in the strategic proﬁles of the two opposed air forces. The German air force, organized in Air Fleets T wo and Three in northern France and Belgium, had not been prepared for an independent air assault carried out over enemy territory against strong active and passive defenses. Although the bomber force was capable of reaching a

The He–111, with the largest bomb lift, could carry 5,512 pounds over a short range, but the later RAF Avro Lancastercould carry 22,000 pounds, and the U.S. Boeing B–17E more than 20,000 pounds. Between September 1940 and May 1941, the German air force dropped 45,969 tons of bombs on British targets. Prewar extrapolations had suggested that the Britishwould ﬁnd bombing on such a scale insupportable, but the damage was restricted in scope outside London and the major dock cities and had a limited effect on war potential. The level of casualties was high, partly because air raid precautions were not extensive enough (few deep shelters had been constructed), and partly because of the concentrations of population in the vicinity of the major dock areas in London, Liver-pool, Southampton, Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Bristol. The toll of 41,987 dead and 49,405 injured over eight months represented a higher level of casualty per ton dropped than the RAF was able to inﬂict in the ﬁrst year of attacks on German targets. 22 EBSCOhost - printed on 10/12/2024 9:39 AM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

Although there was evidence of panic, increased criminality, and defeatism in all bombed areas, urban populations did not collapse in the face of attack, despite the fact that the British had never experienced such high civilian casualties and massive urban destruction in modern history. It is open to debate whether a longer offensive might have eventually provoked a more serious social and political crisis, but by the time the Blitz ended, British air raid precautions and antiaircraft defenses were substantially improved from the opening of the bombing campaign, while much of the threatened population had been evacuated from t

The American P–38 Lightning and P–47 Thunderbolt and the British Hawker Typhoon were all capable of carrying rockets and bombs for attacks on battleﬁeld targets. Recent research has suggested that their role as “tank-busting” aircraft has been exaggerated, but the psychological impact on ground forces that were almost wholly without effective air support was profound. 44 Almost all the senior German generals interrogated about the cause of the Allied victory in the West held the view that air power had been decisive. Hitler’s chief of operations, Colonel General Alfred Jodl, told his American interrogator late in June 1945, “I would say in general that in the end the winning of complete EBSCOhost - printed on 10/12/2024 9:39 AM via COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - MAIN.

These independent air campaigns, critical elements in Western air strategy, were sometimes constrained by, but never entirely subordinate to, the operations of the rest of the armed forces. Although both the British and the Americans viewed bombing as a campaign that could fatally weaken Axis forces at the front by sapping the supply of munitions, the assumption was that an enemy nation would be more likely to succumb if the armed forces in the ﬁeld were simply bypassed and the “vital centers”—the eco
