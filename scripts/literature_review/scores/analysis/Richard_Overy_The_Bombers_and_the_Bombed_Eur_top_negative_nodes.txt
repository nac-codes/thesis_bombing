D'Arcy Osborne, in one of his dispatches from Vatican City, pointed out that many Italians contrasted the Western Allies unkindly with the Red Army, which was “the only one that gets results by fair military means,” unlike Anglo-American forces who “compensate their military inferiority by murder and destructive bombing.”!”° In this sense bombing had a much greater and longer-term social and political impact in Italy than it had in Germany, and one that fitted imperfectly with the “liberating” image that Allied propaganda sought to convey. Communism continued to thrive in postwar Italy in cities where the housing losses, food shortages, and unemployment compromised the achievements of peace. The human costs of the bombing war in Italy are difficult to compute, because Sicily and the Italian peninsula were the sites of two years of harsh warfare that raked its way slowly across the whole territory. Damage to buildings, the loss of artworks, deaths and injuries were caused not only by bombing but by artillery fire, rockets, fighter aircraft, and even by naval fire along the coastline, and from both sides, Allied and Axis. The 8,549 deaths in Sicily before the armistice, for example, were the result of all forms of military action, whereas the 7,000 in Rome were due almost entirely to bombing.” The postwar statistical record drawn up to show the cause of deaths as a result of the war indicated a very precise total of 59,796, though other categories of “poorly specified” or “poorly defined” or “various acts of war” count a further 27,762, some of whom were almost certainly bombing victims.1” The total number of seriously injured has not been recorded.

This liberal opinion is a bit sticky about bombing.” Portal told Sinclair that reluctance could even be found among Bomber Command crews to bombing not only Rome but also Florence or Venice. Sinclair, though a Liberal politician himself, had no cultural scruples—“We must not hedge our airmen round with meticulous restrictions,” he scribbled at the side of a memorandum on bombing Rome—but even he could see that there were political risks in damaging “churches, works of art, Cardinals and priests” until the moment when a sudden blow might produce political dividends that outweighed the disadvantages.” Anthony Eden, the foreign secretary, was strongly opposed to bombing Rome except as a last resort; he resisted several offers from Arthur Harris to use the 617th Squadron (the “Dambusters”) for bombing Mussolini’s official residence, the Palazzo Venezia, or his private Villa Torlonia, on the grounds that the attacks were unlikely to kill him and more likely to reverse the decline in popular support for the dictator.” The long hesitation over whether or when to bomb Rome was finally ended in June 1943 as the Allies prepared to invade Sicily after final victory in North Africa on May 13. To prevent German reinforcement, Eisenhower’s headquarters in Algiers favored bombing two important rail marshaling yards at Littorio and San Lorenzo, the second close to the ancient basilica of the same name. Churchill wrote to Roosevelt on June 10 asking whether he approved the raid, and four days later Roosevelt replied that he was “wholly in agreement” as long as the crews were given the strictest instructions to avoid dropping bombs on the Vatican or on papal property in Rome.” This did not end the political arguments.

Chief of Staff Charles Portal then read it through and changed a few words.

The evidence in the autumn and winter of 1943 was nevertheless slender, based to some extent on imagining what bombing on sucha scale might have meant if it had been British rather than German cities under the hail of bombs.

The Propaganda Ministry approved of the idea in December 1941, but it was overturned by Hitler in January 1942 (who did not want women to be honored that way) and rejected by the armed forces, who thought that it would diminish the value of the symbol for the military dead.1®* Attempts to describe the bomb victims with the military terms “fallen” or “wounded” (Gefallene or Verwundete) were also rejected by the armed forces, since many of those who died did so from willful failure to seek shelter, including a notorious case in Bremen when fourteen partygoers were killed because they wanted to finish their food and drink before going down to the cellar.

The Italian population was faced in the last two years of war with the bleak prospect of living on a wide and dangerous battlefield, caught between the German occupiers, the new Fascist regime, and the slowly advancing Allies. Most of the casualties from bombing occurred in the period after the armistice, since airpower was the one thing the Allies could project easily into the occupied zones. The Allied powers recognized the nature of the dilemma facing most Italians who had not yet been liberated, but they also wanted them to undermine the German occupation from within by acts of resistance or sabotage. An OSS report on the situation in Italy in September 1943 suggested a propaganda campaign to make Italians realize “that the real people’s war of liberation has started for them,” and to encourage them to make life miserable for the Germans. It was also recognized that bombing was likely to be politically counterproductive if it seemed to bring liberation no nearer.

A long report on popular attitudes to the enemy produced in February 1944 indicated occasional evidence of anger directed at British aircrew, but concluded that “hatred against the English people in general cannot be spoken of.” The Soviet people were feared rather than hated, driven by “an alien and incomprehensible mentality.” Paradoxically, wide popular hostility was reserved almost exclusively for the Italians for betraying Germany in 1943 by surrendering to the Allies.2 There were, nevertheless, acts of spontaneous violence directed by the bombed population against aircrew who were caught after they had to bail out and land on German soil.

The RAF had begun to explore the possibility of raiding MMM in the spring of 1942 to aid the Soviet Union, but the operation, at the limit of aircraft range, was regarded as impossible with current strengths. The Combined Chiefs of Staff at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943 called for the immediate bombing of the oilfield, but when Churchill asked Portal to consider the operation he was told that it was still too risky, not only because it would require flying over Turkish airspace to be feasible, but because it would have to be a single heavy and demobilizing strike, which current air strengths in the North African theater could not promise.18* Although Churchill was willing, as he told Eden, “to put the screw very hard on Turkey” to modify its neutrality for the RAF, the attack on IMM when it came was made by American air forces acting under pressure from the American Joint Chiefs to act quickly to block Axis oil supplies.1®5 The British contribution to the opening raid was to supply good maps of the region and large-scale models of the refineries.

German leaders were not so much concerned with re-creating the Fascist state as they were with preventing the Allies from reaching central Europe, but for the Italian people Fascist government remained in place, widely un- popular and despised, until Mussolini’s death at the hands of Italian partisans in late April 1945.  For the Allies, Italy presented both problems and opportunities.

That the level of casualty was not much higher, given that the weight of bombs dropped in Italy was almost six times the weight dropped on Britain during the Blitz, may owe something to the fact that many of the objectives for the tactical bombing attacks in 1943-45 were against rural or small- town targets rather than major cities. It certainly owed little to any Allied concern to limit damage to Italian society. The Allied view was that Mussolini had brought this destruction on Italy’s head by daring to attack Britain side by side with Germany in 1940: “He insisted in participating in the bombing of England,” claimed one British propaganda leaflet, “and so doing sowed the wind and con- demned [Italians] to harvest the tempest.” In another leaflet produced in July 1943, the British Political Warfare Executive (PWE) reminded Italian readers that “the bombardment of the civil popula- tion is an official Fascist theory.”!”2 In the war of words and bombs, Douhet, Italy’s great theorist of unrestricted strategic bombing, came home to roost.

If it is assumed that the figure of 271,000 dead by January 1945 is a realistic, if not precise, total (and there are archive figures that suggest a lower sum), it is possible to extrapolate from the last five months of heavy raiding for which records exist (September 1944 to January 1945) in order to find a possible order of magnitude for deaths in the last three months of the war. The average death toll for these five months was 18,777, which would give an aggregate figure for the whole war period of 328,000, though it would not allow for the exceptional casualty level at Dresden, confirmed by the latest research at approximately 25,000. Adding this would produce a total figure of approximately 353,000, representing 82,000 deaths in the last months. Detailed reconstruction of deaths caused by Royal Air Force bombing from February to May 1945, though incomplete, suggests a total of at least 57,000.? If casualties inflicted by the American air forces are assumed to be lower, since their bombing was less clearly aimed at cities, an overall death toll of 82,000 is again statistically realistic. In the absence of unambiguous statistical evidence, the figure of 353,000 gives an approximate scale consistent with the evidence. It is a little over half the figure of 625,000 arrived at in the 1950s.  The lower figure of 353,000 still represents an exceptional level of unnatural deaths compared with the impact of bombing elsewhere, and with the much lower level of casualties in Germany up until the summer of 1943. The obvious explanation is that repeated raids with 600 or 700 heavy bombers will eventually overwhelm the capacity of civil defense to limit casualties. This was certainly true for smaller cities hit just once, such as Pforzheim or Hildesheim, but

Czech informers made it clear that as allies, the Czech people should not be subjected to area bomb- ing, which would provoke “serious resentment.”!®! The Yugoslav partisan armies welcomed precise raids on German targets, but not raids on the major cities. The propaganda made much of Allied claims for bombing accuracy against military targets but was occasionally let down by the translation. A leaflet destined for Axis Bulgaria in late 1943 had the English “blockbuster bomb” (designed to destroy factories or military facilities) translated into Bulgarian as “homewrecker.”282 These political imperatives were integrated as far as possible with the military planning directed at eastern Europe, although the promise of accuracy was as difficult to fulfill in this case as it had been in the west. For the Western Allies there was only one principal target in eastern Europe once the area came within effective bombing range. The oil-producing region around IMM in Romania supplied around 3 million tons of oil annually to Germany and Italy out of a total production of 5-6 million tons. For Germany, Romanian exports in 1943 amounted to one-third of all German oil products.1£2 Since oil was a major target for the Combined Bomber Offensive, the interruption of Romanian supplies assumed a high priority. The RAF had begun to explore the possibility of raiding MM in the spring of 1942 to aid the Soviet Union, but the operation, at the limit of aircraft range, was regarded as impossible with current strengths.

Side by side with the leaflets, the Allies were accused by the Italian authorities of dropping explosive pencils to kill Italian children: “in one hand a hypocritical lying message,” wrote the Gazzetta del Popolo, “in the other a vile death trap.”® The Fascist press issued its own leaflet accusing the Americans of using black airmen, “the worst men ... the new tribes of savages.”®* A number of Allied leaflets were sent to Mussolini in July 1943 by his Interior Ministry with the assurance that Italians who read them remained calm and unaffected.
