The collapse of aviation fuel supply played an important part; training was cut back even further and strict instructions were given on flight times and procedures to reduce fuel consumption. Both day-fighter and night-fighter squadrons found they had a surplus of pilots with available aircraft, but they could not fly because of the restrictions. The enthusiastic expectations of the Me262 jet fighter were disappointed by the slow pace of development and continued technical problems with the jet turbines. Although 564 jets were produced in 1944, the first fighter squadron armed with the new model began operations only in November.114  The situation for the night fighters was also seriously affected by fuel shortages. Bomber Command losses fell dramatically from the high point of the summer when attacks were still suffering average losses of 6-7 percent. Over the last months of the war, loss rates dropped to an average of 1.5 percent.

Fighters accompanied the aircraft as far as Aachen, thanks to the addition of extra fuel tanks, which pushed their range to 350 miles, but after that the bomber stream was subjected to hundreds of attacks with rocket and cannon fire from enemy fighters.

Even before the conflagration at Hamburg, Goring, despite his anxiety to begin offensive air operations against Britain, admitted to his staff that “air defense is now in my opinion decisive.” The terrible events in Hamburg accelerated the shift to priority for fighter production and intense efforts to combat the scientific lead in radar and radio countermeasures that the Allied air force had established over the summer months.1#° By October, Géring’s deputy, Erhard Milch, had drawn up firm plans for the output of more than 3,000 fighter aircraft a month, and more speculative plans for 5,000 fighters every month during 1945, at the expense of further bomber production.1” By simplifying production methods, reducing the large number of aircraft types, and abandoning the habit of regular modification, Milch calculated that the output could be achieved without a large increase in labor.128 He had already taken over central responsibility for radar and radio development in May and had begun an immediate acceleration of research and production.

The German Air Force had good intelligence warning of incoming attacks and a thorough understanding of enemy tactical weaknesses. Like Fighter Command, the men who fought in the German fighter force were defending their homeland and prepared to take high losses in doing so. As in the Battle of Britain, the German Air Force leaders believed that success in the air was at that point “the most decisive precondition for victory.”©  The comparison is nevertheless a superficial one. Germany’s strategic position in 1944 was very different from Britain’s in 1940, fighting as it was on two major fronts in the Soviet Union and Italy and facing growing resistance in other areas of German-occupied Europe. The German priority was not simply to frustrate the Allied search for air superiority but to try to defend a fortress area in central Europe against overwhelming material superiority on all fronts. The strategic crisis explains the emergency program of fighter production, like the British crisis of the summer of 1940. German fighter output reached its wartime peak between the last months of 1943 and the autumn of 1944, though this was achieved in an environment of heavy and continual bombing. As a result, the gap between German fighter production and Anglo-American fighter output (produced in an almost entirely bomb-free environment) was not as significant as the gap in economic resources might suggest.

There was the constant fear of night fighters and antiaircraft fire or of being coned by searchlights, to which large nighttime formations added the danger of collision or bombs from the invisible aircraft above in the bomber stream. The Eighth Air Force crews had some advantages; the B-17 Flying Fortress was less cold to fly in, and they were provided with good thermal clothing; each aircraft had a pilot and copilot; attacking aircraft were more easily visible, though the limited range of the B-17 machine guns meant that rocket- and cannon-firing fighters could damage the bombers before facing risk themselves.

Spaatz was able to start his assault on the German Air Force before these arguments had been properly formulated and resolved—and in the event between January and May 1944 the Eighth and Ninth air forces based in Britain dropped 111,546 (75 percent) tons of bombs on strategic targets against 38,119 (25 percent) on tactical ones.” The real problem for Spaatz was the difficulty in persuading Harris to share in the task of defeating the German Air Force.  Harris was determined in early 1944 not to abandon the city attacks for a more concentrated assault on German Air Force targets. In January his command was asked directly to abandon indiscriminate area attacks (Harris scrawled “never has been” in the margin of the memorandum) in favor of raids on ball-bearing factories and fighter output as a contribution to the Eighth Air Force effort to establish “free deployment” for the day campaign over Germany.*® Figures were produced by Bomber Command intelligence to show that over one-third of German man-hours had been lost in production structure.??

By the end of the war the Eighth Air Force had dropped a total of 90,357 tons of incendiaries and incendiary clusters, totaling 27 million 4-pound bombs and 795,000 heavy incendiaries.1!* The two-thirds load of incendiary bombs aimed at the residential areas in Hamburg north of the river Elbe to try to stimulate an uncontrollable conflagration was thus no accident. The choice of Hamburg is not difficult to explain. The Air Ministry Target Committee in April 1943 defined Hamburg as “No. 1 priority” because of its shipbuilding industry.1*° It had been attacked repeatedly since 1940, usually in s

This is to misunderstand entirely the purpose of the city-bombing campaign, which was predicated from the start on causing as much general damage and loss of life as possible by means of large-scale fires. The firebombing of Hamburg was not exceptional. Not for nothing was its vulnerability rated “outstanding”; it was expected to burn well.  To understand the capacity of Bomber Command to inflict a conflagration of such intensity on Hamburg, it is useful to place it in the context of the long operational and scientific effort devoted by the Air Ministry to understanding how incendiarism worked.

D. Bernal, wind trials were conducted by the Porton Down Experimental Station in Wiltshire using models of urban areas, while the RAF Photo-Interpretation Section provided night photographs to help in identifying the factors that accelerated the spread of fire.1° It was also necessary to determine scientifically the vulnerability to firebombs of German urban structures, in particular town houses and apartment blocks, and the quantity and mix of bombs necessary to overwhelm the fire services in a single raid. Work on German structures began in 1942 and was more or less complete by the time of the final RE8 report on “German Domestic Architecture” issued early in 1943. Tests on models of different kinds of German roofs were carried out at the Road Research Laboratory at Harmondsworth, outside London, while material on German staircases and stairwells was supplied from a German publication on “Residences and Houses of the Middle Classes.”1° The study of German architecture had involved a good deal of argument over the average thickness of wood beams and the penetrative power of the standard four-pound incendiary summer.

In this sense Harris’s fear that his force could not hit a small urban target effectively was right.44 Further raids were made to support the American campaign against Leipzig, Augsburg, and Stuttgart, where there were aircraft and component firms, but the raid on Leipzig missed the Erla aircraft works entirely at a cost of 11 percent of the attacking force, while the raid on Augsburg did little industrial damage but burnt out the whole medieval center of the city. The raids on Stuttgart, mainly through cloud, were scattered, though a lucky hit was made on the Bosch magneto plant. Throughout the period when Spaatz was attacking the German Air Force, Harris persisted in continuing the Battle of Berlin, where losses remained high and the impact limited. An assessment of the attacks on the capital between November 1943 and February 1944 by RE8 showed that only 5 percent of residential buildings and 5 percent of industrial plants had been damaged in heavy raiding.*? The attacks made in March on Berlin still brought loss rates of between 5 and 9 percent of the force on each raid. The last major British raid of the war on Berlin, on March 24-25, experienced high winds and resulted in scattered bombing across 126 villages and townships. Some 72 aircraft were shot down, 8.9 percent of the force. In April the final city raid against Nuremberg before the switch to the Overlord campaign showed the persistent limitations of area bombing.
