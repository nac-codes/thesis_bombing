Instead of resorting to city burning, the Americans shifted temporarily to attacks on operational targets in France and the Low Countries before returning to strategic bombing of Germany in 1944. The difference can be accounted for by the absence of pressure for revenge, the Americans' greater interest in a cross-Channel inva­ sion, and the imminent availability of a long-range escort fighter (P-51).

Following a series of small, experimental raids against Essen (8 March), Cologne (13 March), Lubeck (28 March), Rostock (23 April), and Stuttgart (4 May), the incendiary campaign began in earnest with the "thousand bomber" raid against Cologne on 30 May. This raid was by far the most dev­ astating of the war up to that point, destroying as much of the city as had 70 previous raids combined. Incendiary raids continued until on 24 July 1943 Harris finally achieved his goal of creating a fire storm, which largely de­ stroyed the city of Hamburg; it was the first time in history such an inferno was produced by air attack. This single raid destroyed one-third of the houses of the city and killed between 60,000 and 100,000 people. The RAF proceeded to destroy one major urban center after another, leaving only cities in the extreme eastern part of the Reich unscathedY Late in the war, the U.S. Army Air Forces joined the morale bombing cam­ paign.

Strategic interdiction came under a critical test during the fall of 1943. In a series of raids beginning on 17 August 1943, the ball-bearing plants at Schweinfurt were attacked. As a result, September production of bearings fell 65 percent. To keep production low, the plants were reattacked on 14 Oc­ tober, and again the target was badly damaged. Nevertheless, despite fur­ ther attacks during 1944, production at Schweinfurt was back to preraid levels by 1944, and there is no evidence from factory records or testimony of production officials that these attacks produced any measurable effect on es­ sential war production. 54 The ball-bearing offensive caused only a temporary setback in production because machines and machine tools were damaged far less severely than factory structures-a phenomenon common to raids on industrial targets. As a result, the Germans had the equipment to disperse part of their pro­ duction between the initial attacks in the autumn of 1943 and their resump­ tion in February 1944. Moreover, stocks of bearings turned out to be relatively generous, sufficient to tide the Germans over during the period when output was being restored. The Germans were able to cannibalize damaged equipment and weapons, draw down stocks, and redesign some equipment to use fewer bearings.55 Meanwhile, these unescorted daylight raids suffered prohibitive losses, including 62 of the 228 bombers in the sec­ ond raid on Schweinfurt, which was well above the 5 percent rate of losses that airmen would generally consider tolerable in sustained bombing oper­ ations.

Germany was not exceptionally vulnerable to eco­ nomic shortages over the long term so long as it could extract resources from Europe as a whole. Temporary shortages of particular materials might occur, but these could often be resolved by state intervention because the huge size of the resource base provided many opportunities for substitution and conservation. As a result, there was no Achilles heel, no small, vulnera­ ble set of factories whose loss would cripple all war production, not even any important category. Even if they existed, moreover, it was nearly impossible to identify soft spots in the German war economy. In order to take substitution fully into ac­ count, it would have been necessary to monitor the daily performance of all sectors of the economy, involving hundreds of industries and many thou­ sands of individual plants, to predict accurately how the destruction of a handful of factories would ripple through the rest of the war economy. Even in peacetime, when access to information is relatively open, forecasts of enemy defense allocations at this level of detail are often in error. In war when the opposing government is seeking to prevent access to such information, es­ timates of current and prospective economic performance are even less reli­ able. The Allies were forced to base economic estimates mainly on agents' reports, press reports, and public statements by German officials rather than on primary documents or firsthand evidence. 58 The Allies thus estimated that Germany had gone to a total war economy early in the war, when in fact it had n

The German case also illustrates the central weakness of applying the in­ dustrial web theory of air attack to a continental power. At bottom, the in­ dustrial web theory seeks to impose an economic blockade from the air, the main criterion of success being whether the attacker can cause severe short­ ages of indispensable goods or services. The main problem is that whether critical shortages can be created is a function not of how goods are currently employed but of how well the economy as a whole can substitute for scarcity in individual products. Two factors are important: the size of the re­ source base and the efficiency of the government in reallocating resources. As a continental power with a highly educated population and sophisti­ cated government administration, Germany was well endowed on both. Ac­ cordingly, Germany could not be brought to the point of economic collapse by wartime shortages. Instead, the shortages that mattered were those relating directly to imme­ diate demands on the battlefield. Oil is the principal case. Destroying Ger­ many's production of fuel oil affected the fighting capability of the Wehrmacht not only because production was limited but also because Ger­ man forces consumed enormous amounts of oil in trying to defend the hun­ dreds of miles of front in the both the east and west. In other words, Germany's need to consume oil was driven by the need to maintain tactical mobility, which could not be replaced by horse-or manpower without sig­ nificant cost in effectiveness. Hence, once a shortage of oil actually occurred, it translated directly into lower fighting effectiveness, but it would not have been so important had not ground forces been pressing

The 311-plane American operation against Dresden was mounted in combination with a British night raid of 770 planes; against rail yards in the cen­ ter of the city; through cloud cover, using radar bombing methods with an average error of two miles; and using a bomb mix including 40 percent incendiaries, the same percentage as the British.

Tunisia fell in June; the Allies invaded Sicily in July and Italy in September; and Mus­ solini's government collapsed. Also in July, Germany's Kursk offensive failed, and in August the Soviets began a counteroffensive that started to roll the Wehrmacht back, inflicting heavy losses. Given their manpower shortage and the immense width of the front, the Germans could not defend any line in sufficient strength to check the Soviet advance completely. At the same time, Allied invasion of France was becoming an increasingly likely possibility. Although current positions could not be held, Germany still retained sub­ stantial attrition capabilities, which could be increased by further mobiliza­ tion of Germany's economy and society. German forces could still exact a heavy toll on the enemy for taking each measure of territory. The Wehrmacht reckoned that between 1 September 1943 and 1 January 1944 the Soviet losses in killed, disabled and POWs amounted to 1.2 million men compared to 243,743 for the Germans. Industrial output was rising, providing enough tanks and weapons to equip new divisions for the western front and replace some of the losses in the Soviet Union.107 The success of this attrition strategy was by no means assured, however, because the USSR was pulling far ahead of Germany in all major categories of military power, and the huge produc­ tive capacity of the Allies would be added. Thus, whereas it might still be possible for Germany to achieve a military stalemate, this was not a foregone conclusion. Occupation of Germany itself had to be considered a growing possibility, although the Soviets were still over 550 miles from Berlin. In m,id-1944, military vulnerability increased to high.

For coercion through denial to succeed, the coercer must exploit the par­ ticular vulnerabilities of the opponent's specific strategy. All military strate­ gies do not share the same weaknesses. Modern nation-states employ two main types of strategies in conflicts with other states: mechanized (or "con­ ventional") war and guerrilla (or "unconventional") war. In this context, "mechanized" refers to the dominance of the types of mechanical weapons and transport provided by the industrial revolution, not to battle tactics that rely on armored vehicles and rapid mobility, such as the German blitzkrieg. The objective in mechanized war is destruction of enemy forces, by means of massive, heavily armed forces that fight intense, large-scale battles along relatively well-defined fronts. Success means routing opposing forces on the battlefield by inflicting sufficient losses to destroy the cohesion of units so they cannot execute combat functions. Guerrilla warfare, in contrast, aims to gain control over population, usually beginning with villages located in re­ mote areas, and to use these as anchors to control still larger segments of the population and thus undermine support for the government. Guerrillas fight in small units dispersed over large areas with no well-defined front line. Combat is intermittent and at low intensity, avoiding major battles. The objective is gradually to wear down the opponent government's political authority and thus its ability to field military forces, rather than to destroy those forces in battle.3D From a coercer's point of view, the most important difference between these two strategies is that me

As technology improves bombing accuracy, air power necessarily becomes more combat effective, because fewer sorties are neces­ sary to destroy targets. At best, measures of combat efficiency are measures of how quickly or cheaply forces perform military missions. They do not gauge whether mission success will achieve political purposes. Measuring the overall success of an air campaign only in terms of combat effectiveness can cause one futile mission to be succeeded by another, while more worthwhile missions are neglected. Against Japan, precision bombing in 1944 was condemned as a failure because it produced no visible damage to industrial plants, and incendiary attacks against Japanese cities begin­ ning in March 1945 were hailed as a great success because burned acreage was easy to observe and quick to accumulate. However, incendiary bomb­ ing ultimately made little difference to the war's outcome. Because Japan's main industries had already been shut down by the naval blockade, their destruction merely made unused rubble bounce, and the Japanese govern­ ment was willing to countenance the civilian costs that the fire bombing caused.

Although the front was still deep in the So­ viet Union, these events placed Germany on the strategic defensive. Some loss of occupied territory was certain, and even attacks on Germany proper had to be considered as an eventual possibility, as evidenced by Hitler's new slogan "defense of the Homeland," used in rallying the armies on the eastern front.lOs Germany's defeats of 1942, however, did not constitute con­ clusive evidence that its army would eventually suffer decisive defeat. Ger­ many had not yet fully mobilized its economy for total war, and it was unclear whether the Western Allies could successfully invade the Continent. Moreover, there existed an alternative-strategic withdrawal-which might 101 Bond, Fire and the Air War; Bidinian, Combined Allied Bomber Offensive, p. 41. 102 Alfred M. de Zayas, Nemesis at Potsdam: The Anglo-Americans and the Expulsion of the Ger­ mans (Boston: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1977), p. xx. 103 Douglas Botting, From the Ruins of the Reich: Germany, 1945-1949 (New York: Crown, 1985), pp. 125-26, 129. 104 Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, p. 47. 105 Ibid., p. 118.

Hence, once a shortage of oil actually occurred, it translated directly into lower fighting effectiveness, but it would not have been so important had not ground forces been pressing the battle. Finally, the German case serves as a warning to those who advocate near complete reliance on air power to win wars.

Indeed, the original plans of the United States to build 240 divisions were stalled at 90 by the need to as­ sign over 1.3 million men to the Army Air Forces at their peak and countless thousands to building an air force that reached twenty-eight thousand planes at its peak.161 Nonetheless, air power played a secondary role to land power, and we must question the wisdom of any long-term defense policy relying exclusively on air power. 161 USSBS, Summary Report (European War), p. 5.  File: --- pape_coercion.pdf --- Page 147 --- [9] Beyond Strategic Bombing The most important reason to study the determinants of coercive success and failure is to draw lessons for future policy debates. Coercion, and strate­ gic bombing, will not go away. Air power is becoming increasingly impor­ tant to American grand strategy. It projects force more rapidly and with less risk of life than land power and more formidably than naval power. These are valuable attributes for unpredictable crises that occur in places where the American public is unwilling to shed much blood. Thus, from Iraq to Bosnia to North Korea, increasingly the first question in debates over Amer­ ican intervention is becoming, Can air power alone do the job?1 The answer is no. First, coercion is very hard. It har

First, after German air raids on London and other English cities in 1940, the British government felt increasing pressure to retaliate against German cities.39 The Cabinet, in fact, had already come to favor area bombing over precision in­ dustrial attacks before sustained bombing of Germany had even begun. Sec­ ond, the failure of precision operations to produce significant results, even though the Cabinet had given Bomber Command first call on British war production in 1941, was politically unacceptable. Third, since a shift to night operations was unavoidable, the British needed targets which were large enough in area to make even a widely spread bomb pattern effective. Only urban areas fit this bill. On 22 February 1942, the precision-oriented chief of Bomber Command, Sir Richard Pierse was replaced by Air Marshal Arthur Harris, who was to execute the new Douhet strategy that had been ordered by the "Towns Di­ rective" of 14 February. Tactics for the raids were optimized to bum down 36 BBSU, Strategic Air War, pp. 1~. 37 A modest move in this direction can be detected after July 1941, when night attacks against marshalling yards in the center of cities began as a compromise between interdiction and morale bombing, "since it was recognized that on only some six moonlight nights a month could specific objectives be bombed, and that on the remaining twenty-four or five conditions were likely to be so bad that attacks, owing to their necessarily 'indiscriminate' character, could be regarded as directed only against morale." BBSU, Strategic Air War, p. 6. 38 As in the case of Japan, the transition in strategies can be dated by tracing changes in tar­ geting, mission profiles, and munitions.

Germany could still impose considerable attrition, but the unmatchable materiel superiority of its enemies meant that Germany could no longer stalemate the Allied advances. From this point onward, Allied advances were constrained more by weather and the need to establish forward logis­ tics bases for each successive advance than by German resistance.109 Attrition could succeed in averting the occupation of the German homeland only if one or more of the Allies could be deterred from prosecuting the war to the end by the prospect of even greater casualties than they had already suffered. In January 1945 the failure of the Ardennes offensive and the successful Soviet offensive in Poland increased Germany's military vulnerability to very high. Existing German forces could no longer hold any line for very long. Against a monthly demand of 1.5 million tank and antitank artillery rounds, January output was 367,000. The Luftwaffe had practically no avia­ tion gasoline. Even before the Soviet offensive in Poland, the force balance on the eastern front was hopelessly uneven; afterward, it was even worse (see Table 26). Although Allied losses continued at a steady rate during the last months of the war, German forces could no longer hope to impose attri­ tion for a protracted period of time because the distance between the eastern and western fronts had become so short that the Allied advances could be expected to meet in the very near future. no American and Russian forces meet at Torgau on the Elbe on 22 April. The dependent variables are the policy preferences of German leaders in each of the four main groups-Hitler, the Nazi civilian leadership, the mili­ tary leadership, and the resistance. Ideally, to determine the effect of in­ creasing civilian and military vulnerability on German decision making, we would measure the views of every important individual for each period when there was an increase in either type of vulnerability.

As the invasion progressed, however, the German lo­ gistic position deteriorated because the fluidity of the fighting reduced the usefulness of prepositioning supplies, while air interdiction made the movement of logistics more and more difficult. Starting in September 1944, heavy attacks were launched against mar­ shalling yards, bridges, lines, and train movements, producing a serious disruption in traffic throughout western Germany. Freight car loadings, which were approximately 900,000 in August, fell to 700,000 by the end of October, to 550,000 by the end of December, and to 214,000 by the first week of March 1945. Despite reduced industrial production from lost transporta­ tion, there was no immediate shortage of weapons for the German fighting forces.71 Rather, the main effect of lack of transport was the inability to put weapons and supplies in the hands of divisions actually fighting. On 23 March when the German forces retreated across the Rhine, combat forma­ tions were short almost all supplies other than food, especially fuel and am­ munition, even though r~ar depots contained large stocks until the end of the war.72 Strategic air power, however, was not the decisive cause of these effects. Whereas strategic forces damaged 20 of 25 marshalling yards, tactical air forces destroyed 12 of the 18 major bridges, 101 minor bridges, 4,000 loco­ motives, and 28,000 cars and created over 5,000 line cutS?3 The important point is that operations were interdicted mainly by tactical air attacks and these effects would have occurred even if the strategic offensive had not taken place.74 Invasion , The Allies' landing in France signaled a shift from coercion to conquest a
