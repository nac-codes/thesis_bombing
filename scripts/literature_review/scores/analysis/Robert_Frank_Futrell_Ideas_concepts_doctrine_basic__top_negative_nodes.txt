Early in November the H-bomb controversy blossomed in the American public press, with elaborate arguments being developed on both sides. Troubled by the divided opinion in the AEC report, President Truman on 10 November designated Secretary of State Dean Acheson, Secretary of Defense Johnson, and AEC chairman David E. Lilienthal as a special subcommittee of the National Security Council to make recommendations to him. In the following weeks, the departments of State and Defense moved into accord on the necessity of producing thermonuclear weapons, as did the joint congressional committee. The matter, nevertheless, continued under consideration until late January 1950, when Dr Klaus Fuchs, a former group leader at the Los Alamos atomic weapons laboratory, confessed that he had passed nuclear secrets to the Soviets, a situation that demanded immediate action. In a day-long meeting on 31 January, secretaries Acheson and Johnson agreed upon the need for immediate and full-scale development of the thermonuclear bomb. Lilienthal opposed that view, arguing that there was a considerable doubt as to the technical feasibility of thermonuclear weapons and advocating that a better course of action would be to create more flexible atomic weapons. At the conclusion of the discussion, the special committee recommended that President Truman direct the Atomic Energy Commission to take immediate steps to develop a thermonuclear weapon. Accepting the recommendation, Truman announced on 31 January

On 10 August the Japanese government officially announced its decision to accept the Potsdam surrender terms, provided the surrender would not alter the institution of the emperor. Although Japan did not surrender unconditionally, the United States and its Allies accepted Japan’s offer and terminated active hostilities on 12 August 1945.13  The revolutionary employment of nuclear air weapons and the entry of the Soviet Union into the war tended to obscure the contributions of the sustained  166  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 188 --- AF THINKING AND WWII  conventional strategic air offensive to the defeat of Japan. Looking backward, Spaatz could not see how the entry of Russia into the war had any effect on Japan’s decision to surrender. He believed that conventional bombing could have ended the war, but he thought that the employment of the atomic bomb had been justified as a means of ensuring, without doubt, that many Americans would not have to lose their lives in a tremendously costly surface invasion.!4 "Without attempting to minimize the appalling and far-reaching results of the atomic bombs," Arnold observed, "we have good reason to believe that its actual use provided a way out for the Japanese government. The fact is that the Japanese could not have held out long, because they lost control of their air. They could not offer effective opposition to our bombardment, and so could not prevent the destruction of their cities and industries.» Based upon a thorough investigation, the United States Strategic Bombing Survey stated its opinion that "certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would even have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and e

As has been seen, the acceptance of massive retaliation in 1954 did not lead the Joint Chiefs of Staff to change the categories of target systems for strategic air war planning purposes. During the Sputnik crisis, however, the Air Force gave some serious thoughts to a counterforce strategy and for the first time assigned some specific meanings to massive retaliation. Speaking in 1959 General White said that the strategic target priorities continued to be: "One, to destroy the enemy’s capability to destroy us — that would be the first priority; next would be to blunt the enemy attack against our deployed military forces in Europe and in Asia; and, third, systematically destroy the Soviet Union’s ability to wage war." If it were given strategic and tactical warning, White pointed out that the United States could implement these orderly attack priorities, but he noted that the growth of Soviet capabilities to attack the United States made it likely that a United States second strike might have to be somewhat improvised. "In case of a surprise attack," he suggested, "the mission would be . . . to do the greatest possible damage to the Soviet Union as a whole with attention to applying that destruction in such a way as to do as much damage as possible to their residual military striking force." Following this same line of reasoning, Col Robert C. Richardson demonstrated that massive retaliation had always been a specific response within the whole American strategy. "Massive retaliation," Richardson wrote,  relates principally to what happens after the enemy tries a surprise attack against the United States proper. The deterrent to an attack of this nature lies in the Strategic Air Command’s capability, even after having been hit first, to strike back, "retaliate," with sufficient atomic power to wipe out the enemy’s major urban centers. This is massive retaliation. The targets are cities; the forces use

Since 1946 many scientists had been more interested in the employment of the atom for peace than for war."  As early as April 1942, atomic scientists Edward Teller and Enrico Fermi discussed the possibility of developing a fusion or thermonuclear weapon that would yield infinitely more power than the fission-type atomic weapon. But the decision had been made to develop the atomic bomb. And, although a small research program on the thermonuclear energy was continued, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) gave no major consideration to the question of undertaking active development of a thermonuclear weapon, which would be better known as the H-bomb. Immediately after Truman’s announcement in September 1949 that an atomic explosion had occurred in the Soviet Union, a staff paper was prepared in the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy advocating that an H-bomb be developed, to which the Atomic Energy Commission replied that it was doing all that it could in the thermonuclear field. On the Atomic Energy Commission, however, retired Adm Lewis L. Strauss reasoned that the United States could not afford merely to seek to maintain an arithmetic lead over the Russians in stockpiling A-bombs. Therefore, on 5 October he proposed to his colleagues that the time had come for a quantum jump in the form of an intensive effort to develop the thermonuclear weapon. The Atomic Energy Commission’s General Advisory Committee of scientists and engineers opposed a crash program to develop an H-bomb on both technical and moral grounds, and the majority of the membership of the Atomic Energy Commission did not favor an all-out thermonuclear program. On 9 November, however, the entire problem was laid before President Truman.

President Eisenhower rejected Khrushchev’s threat as abusive.!™4 But the threat that local war could expand into general war if nuclear weapons were used could not be ignored. Vice Adm Charles R. Brown, commander of the US Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean, subsequently stated: "I would not recommend the use of any atomic weapons no matter how small, when both sides have the power to destroy the world. . .. I have no faith in the so-called controlled use of atomic weapons."!?>  The experience of Lebanon and Quemoy thus appeared to justify General Taylor’s argument before the National Security Council earlier in 1958 that, in many limited war situations, the United States would not wish to employ nuclear weapons. "We would always go into a military operation prepared to use nuclear weapons," Taylor explained in March 1959, "because we never know what the outcome is going to be. The decision to use them . . . would be determined by the President."’”° About this same time, Gen Henry I.

Although the strategic bombing campaigns of World War II had been directed against hostile industry for good reason, production and mobilization would contribute little or nothing to the outcome in an atomic war. "Today," he wrote, "victory lies not in the ability to destroy the enemy industrial and manpower potential but rather in the ability to destroy his existing capability for delivering destruction." As for the allegation that Soviet missile sites could not be targeted, Richardson pointed out that new intelligence techniques should provide knowledge of the construction of hardened missile sites, that the vulnerability of mobile missiles to slight overpressures should allow them to be targeted and attacked on an area basis with the help of reconnaissance, and that within the time frame of concern the United States would have constant satellite surveillance that should provide intelligence on missile movements or site construction. "The minimum-deterrent strategy sought by critics of the existing counterforce deterrent capability," Richardson wrote i summary, “is one which would lead to unlimited requirements for limited war."  While Admiral Burke was presenting the case for finite deterrence to the House Subcommittee on Appropriations in January 1960, Congressman Daniel J. Flood exclaimed: "This theory I do not believe. This is terrible."“41 When it reported the defense budget bill out in April, the House Committee on Appropriations expressed disbelief in finite deterrence. "In the final analysis," the committee noted, "to effectively deter a would-be aggressor, we should maintain our Armed Forces in such a way and with such an understanding that should it ever become obvious that an attack upon us or our allies is imminent, we can launch an attack before the aggressor has hit us or our allies.

Accepting the central purpose of American policy as being the establishment and maintenance of conditions throughout the world under which the democratic experiment as laid down in the Constitution could survive and prosper within the United States, the ad hoc group viewed the principal threat to this objective as stemming from the Kremlin’s design for world domination. The planners believed, however, that the Kremlin placed first importance on the maintenance of their regime in the Soviet Union; second importance on the preservation of their power base in Russia; and third importance upon the objective of eventual world domination. The planners did not believe that the Communist leaders would initiate a general war until they had developed their atomic stockpile to respectable proportions, which might take them to 1954.

Accepting the recommendation, Truman announced on 31 January that on the previous day he had directed the Atomic Energy Commission "to continue its work on all forms of atomic weapons, including the so-called hydrogen or superbomb.""” In protest Lilienthal resigned as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission on 15 February and was shortly thereafter replaced by Gordon Dean.  The decision of the United States to emphasize the weapon aspects of thermonuclear energy shortly provided the beginnings of a family of nuclear weapons. Late in February 1950 the Atomic Energy Commission announced that it would turn out A-bombs on a virtual production-line basis. Thus, the critical problem of atomic supply, long considered a question in military planning, had apparently been solved. As a matter of fact, uranium ores were never scarce. The military had based its requirements on an assumption that the availability of raw materials would rigidly limit production; meanwhile the Atomic Energy Commission did not step up its materials procurement program because the limited requirements could not be met without expanding existing sources. Higher prices offered for uranium ores following the decision in 1950 to expand production led to the discovery of large mineral reserves in the United States. Technological innovations in the thermonuclear program also permitted refinements in A-bomb technology. In May 1950 a military requirement for a small bomb that could be delivered by high-performance aircraft was forwarded to the Atomic Energy Commission, and in this same month the Sandia Corporation  284  Google  File: --- futrell_ideas.pdf --- Page 306 --- SOVIET NUCLEAR WEAPONS  reported that it would be possible to proceed with the manufacture of an efficient A-bomb that could be transported and dropped by fighter-type aircraft.“4 Where nuclear weapons

By a fortunate circumstance, moreover, the Communists had launched their local aggression in Korea, which was one of the few spots along the Soviet periphery that was at all close to any concentration of available American military forces. In fact, the presence of US forces in Japan probably had much to do with the nature of the reaction. "The reason why we got involved in this periphery war, which is not a part of our global strategy," Finletter stated, "is that the enemy came down right under our noses, where we had the greatest concentration of American military power outside the United States."””  Despite a complete knowledge that the Soviet Union and Communist China were aiding the North Korean armed aggression, President Truman was adamant that the conflict would be limited to Korea’s borders. "Every decision I made in the Korean conflict," he wrote, "had this one aim in mind: to prevent a third world war and the terrible destruction it would bring to the civilized world. This meant that we should not do anything that would provide the excuse to the Soviets and plunge the free nations into full-scale all-out war."” In the early days of the Korean emergency, Truman directed the US Seventh Fleet to isolate Formosa from the Communist mainland, ordered that Far East Air Forces and Naval Forces Far East aircraft would stay well clear of the frontiers of Manchuria and the Soviet Union, and instructed Secretary Johnson to revise a directive to MacArthur so as to eliminate an implication that the United States might be planning to go to war against the Soviet Union.’“ Secretary Acheson also believed that the Korean hostilities must be limited. "The whole effort of our policy is to prevent war and not have it occur," he stated. "Our allies," he added, "believe this just as much as we believe it, and their immediate danger is much greater than ours because if g
