Little more than two weeks after Pearl Harbor was attacked, Jack Warner wrote to Arnold stating that his studio had earlier bought the rights to make a film based on Mitchell’s life, but that with the nation now locked in war he felt that it was best not to open old interservice wounds. He asked Arnold for his “off the record” advice on the matter. Arnold wrote back on New Year’s Eve and whole-heartedly agreed with Warner’s reservations stating that it would be best for the nation to wait on the project. “Later,” Arnold added, “when the situation is a little less acute, the picture...may be of real assistance from the moral standpoint.” A week later Warner wrote back to inform Arnold that he would wait until some future date to make the movie.4 1 The studio waited until 1955 to make the movie, and thus it reflects elements of mid-fifties Cold War concerns, but its primary emphasis was a belated contribution to the effort to recast public memory of Billy Mitchell with Gary Cooper playing the leading role. From start to finish the film depicts the Army and Navy as obstinately indifferent to the capabilities of air power and Mitchell as the heroic leader of airmen in both services who see what air power can do but who are needlessly dying in their effort to keep American air power alive.4 2  Mitchell’s sinking of the Ostfriesland , for example, is depicted as a prol

Air power, though, was Huie’s first cause, but it was a cause he would repudiate later in life. He began his curious odyssey in the early days of World War II when, as an associate editor for the American Mercury,  he came in contact with de Seversky and Hugh Knerr, at the time a retired Air Corps colonel. Huie talked with these two men and read the articles they had written for the American Mercury  and somewhere in the process of this exposure Huie was converted, for in 1942 he wrote, with considerable help from Knerr, The Fight For A ir Power,  a passionate plea for America to end the domination and suppression of air power by Army and Navy leaders who did not understand it.4 9  Huie’s personal story then takes a curious turn. He joined the Navy the next year and served out the rest of the war as a naval officer. While one might have expected Huie to join the AAF, his joining the Navy is all the more curious because his 1942 book is particularly harsh on the admirals. Ms postwar writings escalated his anti-Navy rhetoric even further. In his 1946 book, The Case Against the Admirals,  Huie claims that he enjoyed his wartime service and that he had many reasons to love the Navy.

After Dr. Arnold had secured an appointment, the elder brother announced he wanted to become an electrical engineer and the appointment went to Henry.2  Arnold began his military career at West Point with inauspicious record. A mediocre student, Arnold also showed an early rebellious streak.

Too often we forget that members of pressure groups are also members of the society they hope to reform. In the case of postwar air power advocates, their thinking was in part shaped by the euphoric cultural atmosphere of their youth when nothing seemed too fantastic to ascribe to the new miracle of aviation. Furthermore, works of early air power advocates, Billy Mitchell and others, which aimed to influence society through popular culture, helped to influence the thinking 18 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

This is not just the story of the military influencing society, but also of society influencing the military. As members of American society in the early days of flight, those who would later become air power advocates were swept up in the same spirit of aviation euphoria that spurred the public imagination. Just as others were imagining all sorts of fantastic properties for aviation, air power advocates imagined similar properties for air power; just as aviation enthusiasts believed aviation would revolutionize human affairs, air power enthusiasts believed that air power would revolutionize warfare. The two realms were part of the same cultural phenomenon in the first decades after the Wright Brothers’  flight.

The interaction between air power and popular culture is a critical chapter in understanding the rise of American air power. The early air power proponents were caught up in the eschatological visions that burst forth in America’s popular imagination at the dawn of flight, and these visions spawned a revolutionary dream for air power in the imagination of its advocates, the ramifications of which can be traced into the early 1960s. While Michael Sherry has described the air power proponents’  agitation in the interwar period and its effects on the use of air power in World War n, that chapter in air power history is merely a prelude to the crusade air power advocates launched in popular culture after the war. Relying on obvious manifestations of widespread public support and sympathetic editors, publishers, directors, and producers - in short, those who controlled popular culture - air power proponents dramatically increased their efforts to spread their message after World War n, and for a long period met with a highly receptive audience. 6 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

After the war, however, the notion of revolutionary air power entered the mainstream of American popular culture to a degree unimagined in 1941. In the immediate postwar environment one detects a distinct difference in the status of the claims made for air power. On a superficial level one could point to the sharply increased number of works in popular culture arguing for, or extolling the capabilities of air power. But on a deeper level one senses a wider acceptance of the notion, described earlier, that air power was more than just a synonym for military aviation, that it represented a frame of mind, a philosophy for understanding not only aviation but its place in the wider world and in human affairs. One reflection of this heightened status is that starting in the May 1945-April 1947 edition of Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature  “air power” appears for the first time as a separate subject heading for listing articles.1  Befo

Mitchell, according to the movie, merely wanted to win support for air power, not discredit the Army. In reality, Mitchell arranged for Liberty  magazine to publish articles around the time of the trial to maximize his publicity.4 3 In presenting the trial itseff the film used an approach found in other works of air power advocacy, that of portraying supporters of air power as sensible and reasonable while portraying its critics as dull-witted, malicious, or biased by service loyalties.

You can’t.”3 7 One measure of the effectiveness of this campaign, and the widespread sympathy for Mitchell and for air power in general, is that in 1946 Congress voted a special medal of honor to be posthumously awarded to Mitchell. This medal is frequently confused with the Congressional Medal of Honor, as, for example, when Huie states that, “Congress acknowledged the national shame and pinned the Congressional Medal of Honor upon Mitchell’s ghost.”3 8  The design of the medal and its inscription, though, as well as the wording of the bill authorizing the medal, make clear that it has no connection with the nation’s highest military honor.3 9  Still, this unique recognition of Mitchell by joint act of Congress is a reflection of the widespread sentiment after World War II that America was deeply indebted to Mitchell and needed to make amends for past treatment. The medal was presented to Mitchell’s son, William Mitchell, Jr., by Chief of Staff Carl Spaatz on 27 March 1948. Mitchell’s family later tried to follow-up on the official sentiments embodied in the medal by having Mitchell’s court martial conviction officially overturned. In this they were joined by the Air Force Association, and in 1956 their petition went before Air Force Secretary James Douglas. The petition was turned down, however, in recognition of the fact that while his motives may have been laudable, his insubordinate actions could not be officially sanctioned by any military organization, even the Air Force.4 0 Perhaps the public culminati

Throughout the war, then, it seems that two images of American air power and the AAF’s bombing campaigns coexisted side-by-side. During the war military and civilian leaders tried to hide or minimize the growing practice of bombing civilian targets,1 4 4  but this does not tell the whole story of public perceptions of American bombing, for other voices also projected images of air power that proved quite popular with the public.

In November 1945 Life magazine cited Arnold’s writings as the inspiration for its story “The Thirty-Six Hour War” in which a sudden atomic missile attack from an unnamed adversary brings America to its knees. So powerful was the image of near-instantaneous devastation from nuclear attack that one author, Russell V. Ritchey, envisioned a scenario where the 199 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

The story ends with the president presenting the ultimatum to his cabinet and asking the question that was the story’s title, “What Would You Do?”5 7 Some air power advocates would later back away from predictions of quick and easy victory, and they would later have to contend with heightened public fears when the Soviets developed their own atomic bomb, fears the air power advocates had themselves helped to cultivate. But air power advocates found it harder to erase public images of nuclear victory or defeat than it had been to create those images. The predictions of quick victory, though, point to a fallacy that had long lurked beneath the surface of the notion of an air power revolution. Running at least as far back as Douhet’s Command o f the Air,  air power advocates had been promising that air power could quickly defeat any nation, and they had enjoyed considerable success in awakening public expectations for such capability. The title, “The Thirty-Six Hour War,” of 1945 is more than coincidentally reminiscent of Stuart Chase’s 1929 article “The Two-Hour War.”5 8  Both articles are products of the exaggerated claim

De Seversky’s popularity disseminated darker images that meshed with passions generated within the American public by the war to create a public mood advocating bombing enemy cities and civilians.1 4 5  Anxious for revenge and desparate to shorten the war and save American lives, the public was willing to use any weapon that promised to accomplish these goals, even if it meant adopting methods that only a few years earlier would have sparked moral outrage. Images in popular magazines not only reflected this bloodlust, but to a certain extent helped to shape it. A United States News  pictograph on the eve of Pearl Harbor extolled America’s ability to bomb Japanese cities, which it points out were comprised of “rice-paper and wood houses,” while a wartime Life magazine pictograph depicted a blanket of bombers a mile wide and 117 miles long. These and other examples conveyed more of an image of brute force than precision in American air power.1 4 6  Furthermore, articles appeared throughout the war conveying the message that enemy cities and civilians 76 Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner.

For example, only one month after General Curtis LeMay’s devastating firebombing raid on Tokyo, Collier’ s  carried a story about the development of America’s incendiary bombs and how they were being put to use in Japan. The celebratory text makes it clear that the incendiaries are burning homes and causing large numbers of civilian casualties. The accompanying illustration shows a highway leading to a city engulfed in flames. By the road is a signpost labeled “U.S. Route 40" leading from Utah to Tokyo.1 4 7  Government

One of my primary reference sources was R ea d er’ s  G uide to P eriodic L itera tu re  which catalogs articles appearing in numerous magazines ranging from general interest to specialized. I followed two basic approaches in searching for pertinent articles. First, I searched under such topic headings as “Air Power,” “Aeronautics, Military,” and “United States - Air Force,” for articles dealing with air power topics. Secondly, I searched for articles written by noted air power authors. This method yielded an exhaustive wealth of material. In both approaches, for reasons outlined above, I noted articles listed in aviation-oriented magazines and news magazines, but generally focused on articles carried by magazines known for their mass appeal and primary emphasis on entertainment. Because of the vagaries of topics and categorization as well as the restrictive focus on general interest magazines, I have not attempted a statistical analysis of the frequ
