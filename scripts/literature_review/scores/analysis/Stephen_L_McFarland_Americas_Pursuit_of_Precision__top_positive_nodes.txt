Patrol Wing One wanted the Sperry autopilot because it was more rugged and reliable, less expensive (in 1940, $3,000 compared to $4,200 for the Norden SBAE), more amenable to quantity production, lighter by 50 pounds, created no security problem, and required less main- tenance.34 BuAer ruled that twin-engine patrol aircraft only had room for one and they would get the SBAE. Four-engine aircraft could carry both and would get both. Chief of Naval Operations Stark ordered the fleet to use the SBAE, asserting that the "effectiveness of the SBAE is solely a matter of proper adjustment and intelligent use." Dictums from on high could not cor- rect the problems users experienced, however. The Navy had temporarily solved the problem by deciding to do nothing.35 The Army could not equivocate. It needed an autopilot that could serve both functions. Every pound of extra equipment meant one less pound of explosives in Air Corps bombers. Operational units and Wright Field engineers spoke with one voice in their dislike for the Norden SBAE. The complaints were constant: the SBAE caused skidding in turns, gave a ride too rough for the crews, and failed to work effectively at high altitudes and at low speeds. The SBAE's "very high" maintenance and training require- ments caused nightmares among Air Corps planners. Requests that the Navy and Norden modify it to meet Air Corps needs went unanswered, largely because "Old Man Dynamite," according to BuOrd's Cdr. Malcolm Schoeffel, would never agree to change it.36 One problem with the SBAE proved unsolvable and insured the Air Corps would pursue a replacement.

In 1926 McCook's Henry In- glis had suggested connecting a bombsight, in the fashion of the Norden Mark XI, to the PDI to allow the bombardier to signal the correct course directly to the pilot by adjusting the bombsight's controls. Although still relying on a human pilot, it was a step toward having the bombardier fly the aircraft. When Alexander de Seversky proposed to design and build a C-1 bombsight for the Air Corps in a letter of August 2, 1926, Inglis en- couraged him to include an attachment to go one step further and allow  Chapter 2 40 The Army's Pursuit of Precision Bombing the C-1 sight to detect and correct errors automatically by maneuvering the aircraft's control surfaces. Negotiations for this Seversky Automatic Azimuth Drift Control floundered, however, on Seversky's demand for a $10,000 payment for the idea. The Air Corps refused to pay for something its own Engineering Division had originated.53 Mortimer F. Bates of the Sperry Gyroscope Company sought patent protection in October 1929 for his design linking the A-1 autopilot to the C-series bombsights. His design put the steering of the aircraft "directly under the control of the bomber [bombardier] at the bomb sight [and] . . . to steer the dirigible craft in the act of sighting upon a target."54 Turning the idea into a workable device proved difficult and by 1933 the lack of funds, the realization that the Sperry C-series bombsight project was going nowhere, and the rumored accuracy of a new Norden bombsight forced the Army to bring all bombsight development projects to a halt, including attempts to link bombsights and automatic pilots. Automatic pilot work continued, but mainly as a device for long-range navigation and safety in poor weather.

An observer could only wonder if both services were serving the same country.31 By 1937 Wright Field's efforts to connect the Norden bombsight with the Sperry A-2 autopilot had gone nowhere. Efforts to connect Sperry bombsights to the Sperry A-2 autopilot were more successful, but left the Air Corps with inferior bombsights. The Air Corps had little choice but to go with the Norden SBAE, to decrease bombing errors, decrease the length of bombing runs, allow the bombardier to undertake evasive ma- neuvers to the target, and reduce the training required for novice bombar- diers. It also had to continue to purchase Sperry autopilots because of the SBAE's inadequacies in directional control and because of the jarring ride the SBAE's mechanical linkages provided. The first SBAE-equipped Nor- den Mark XV bombsight appeared on an Air Corps aircraft (the B-18 bomber), also equipped with a Sperry A-2 autopilot, in June 1938.32 Adding 126 pounds of SBAE to allow an aircraft to serve as a bomber was wasteful and inefficient when the autopilot could perform the same functions as the SBAE, though perhaps not as effectively.33 Even Navy units complained.

This, plus BuOrd and Norden's refusal to pursue a solution, forced the Air Corps' hand. On January 6, 1940, it formally informed the Navy that it intended to replace the Norden SBAE with a new Sperry A-5 AFCE, to be designed with elec- trical controls, servomotors located near the aircraft's control surfaces, and electrically operated gyroscopes compatible with the Norden bombsight.

At preflight school aviation cadets received basic military instruction, including physical training, aca- demic instruction, map reading, aircraft recognition, radio instruction, drill, and military courtesy.

The elimi- nation rate was significantly higher than the 3 percent at the Eagle Pass advanced single-engine fighter pilot training program, though ironically pilot training washouts were a primary source for bombardiers during the war.13 The United States needed one bombardier for every five pilots, but only one out of eighteen cadets in training requested bombardier school.

Norden completed two production models in late 1936, one for the Army and one for the Navy, but BuOrd decided to keep both for Navy use, concluding that it was not in the Navy's interests "to let the Air Corps have one of the production models."29 After production began in June 1937 at a rate of seven to ten per month, BuOrd agreed to release one for Army testing.

Here the various components of a bombardment group merged to train as a team. From December 1942 to August 1945 nearly 30,000 heavy (B-17 and -24) and super-heavy (B-29) bombardment crews received such training.

What did not vary was low altitudes for training missions. In the first six months of 1944, the four stateside numbered air forces dropped 678,190 practice bombs, but more than half were from below 10,000 feet.

Each formation would fly straight to their targets from the initial point, approximately 10 minutes, rather than maneuvering to avoid flak, giving bombardiers plenty of time to synchronize their bombsights. The arrival of the C-1 automatic flight control equipment (AFCE) in early 1943 in- sured a straight and level approach.14 With all aircraft flying in a fixed formation, however, bombardiers were unable to aim their loads individually. LeMay's solution was "dropping- on-the-leader," by which a lead bombardier aimed the bombs of the entire formation. The combat box maintained proper positioning, following the leader to the target. The other bombardiers released their bombs either after receiving a radio cue from the lead bombardier or a visual cue from a flare or from seeing the lead's bombs drop.15 In larger formations the lead bombardier maneuvered to bring the formation over the target, but deputy lead bombardiers determined the proper drop point. Eighth Air Force's Operational Research Section recommended that one bombardier should calculate both, leaving individual bombardiers to serve as "toggliers," flicking the bomb-release toggle switch upon signal from the leader.16 Carl Norden had designed his bombsight to minimize human involve- ment and human error, but dropping-on-the-leader forced the human back into the procedure. Eighth Air Force discovered that the technique caused combat boxes to overshoot the target, especially when tail winds increased ground speeds. Larger formations of several combat boxes tended to undershoot. At 185 MPH, a delay of one second caused a bomb to drop 270 feet beyond the target.

A critical technology of the A-1 was Sperry's development of an air-stabilized gyro- scope. Acceleration of the aircraft and bearing friction tended to make the gyroscope precess in a direction at right angles to the force of the acceleration or friction. This caused the autopilot to engage and apply correcting action when not necessary. Sperry directed an air stream at pendulum vanes covering four exhaust ports in the shaft space at the bottom of the gyroscope. When acceleration or friction caused gyroscopic precession, the gyroscope fol- lowed the vertical seeking pendulums, compensating and maintaining the true vertical.

Sperry designed its autopilots to receive direction instructions by rate signal, while Norden designed its bomb- sights to send direction instructions to the SBAE by displacement signal. BuOrd again tried to scuttle the project, claiming that the results did "not indicate the need to replace the Norden SBAE with the Sperry automatic pilot at this time," but in a major policy reversal decided not to object to the adapter. The Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia solved the signals problem and reported excellent results from the revised adapter, though a human pilot had to control the ailerons because of the absence of a propor- tional banking feature. Dahlgren completed bombing tests in late August 1941 and the Naval Aircraft Factory began construction of forty adapters for service testing in September, completed in December, at approximately $750 each. 40 In January 1942 BuAer recommended to the chief of naval operations that the SBAE be eliminated in favor of the A-3 autopilot and Naval Air- craft Factory adapter, judging the SBAE "superfluous." BuOrd disagreed but did not block the measure. The Bureau of Supplies and Accounts noti- fied Norden in May 1942 that all remaining SBAE contracts would be for skeletonized units only, still needed to connect the Norden bombsight to the new Naval Aircraft Factory adapter and Sperry A-3 autopilot. The complete Norden SBAE served into 1944, however, because of A-3 shortages.41 While the Navy pursued the Naval Aircraft Factory's adapter, the Air Corps sought a different solution. Carl Norden, "adamantly a mechanical engineer," refused to consider electronic components to correct the SBAE. In mid-1941 the Army Air Forces asked the Minneapolis-Honeywell Reg- ulator Company of Minneapolis to design a new AFCE with electronic parts to link the A-3 autopilot and the Norden bombsight without the need for the Naval Aircraft Factory's mechanical-electrical adapter. In a rush to complete the p

In November 1938 President Roosevelt told his military commanders to work toward an Air Corps of 20,000 aircraft, though before Congress in January 1939 he lowered the figure to 3,000. In April 1939 Congress raised that number to 6,000. With the German invasion of France in May 1940, Roosevelt set 50,000 aircraft as the annual goal of America's aircraft production. In the fall of 1941 the six officers of the Air War Plans Division required a bomb- sight for each of 10,837 heavy bombers, a monthly production of 1,260 for replacement bombers, and thousands more for medium bombers, for trainers, and to meet Navy requirements. Roosevelt raised production goals in January 1942 to 60,000 aircraft for 1942 and 125,000 for 1943. No one knew how many bombers would be needed, but the two government agencies charged with bombsight procurement, the Navy's BuOrd and the Army's Materiel Division, knew Carl L. Norden, Inc., producing an aver- age of only 108 Mark XV Norden bombsights per year from 1931 through 1938, could not meet the demand (see Table 7.1). One major obstacle to the incorporation of the Norden bombsight into the Air Corps was security. The Navy classified the bombsight and "all correspondence and conversation relating thereto" as secret, requiring "every precaution in order to prevent information regarding this develop-  114 Chapter 7 115 Preparation for War Table 7.1.

When tens of thousands of civilians rushed into bombardier and'bombsight maintenance training beginning in 1940, security became a nightmare. The Army Air Forces assigned local commanders responsibility for in- suring all personnel granted access receive instruction in the importance of security. Local rules were to "insure an unusual degree of secrecy." Ship- ping was to be done under a code system, substituting the words "siding, latent, telescope, mickey, dusty, external, and talon" for "bombsight." If shipped by Army truck or aircraft, the bombsight and SBAE/AFCE re- quired an armed guard. If threatened with enemy capture, the device was to be destroyed.17 To impress young trainees with the seriousness of security, some com- manders required their charges to take a bombardier's oath. In the presence of Almighty God, I do solemnly swear and affirm that I will accept the sacred trust placed in me by my Commander in Chief, the President of the United States of America, by whose direction I have been chosen for bombardier training. I pledge myself to live and act according to the code of honor of the bombardiers of the Army Air Forces. I solemnly swear that I will keep inviolate the secrecy of any and all confidential information revealed to me, and in full knowledge that I am a guardian of one of my country's most priceless military assets, do further swear to protect the secrecy of the American Bombsight, if need be, with my life itself.18 Stateside, bombardiers in training learned the routine: trips to the bomb- sight vault with an armed escort, the long walk with a heavy metal bomb- sight box to the airplane, the metal covers and stowage boxes on the air- craft for hiding and securing the SBAE/AFCE and bombsight, and the hours spent under arms guarding the instruments on the aircraft.

BuAer questioned the continuation of the high-altitude horizontal bombing tech- nique when "the average low cloud form ceiling throughout the world is approximately 4,000 feet." The commander-in-chief of the U.S. Fleet de- termined that even "at 10,000 feet [bombers] would have little chance  108 Chapter 6 109 Navy Adopts Dive Bombing against the anti-aircraft fire." Torpedo bomber units attempted to perfect night attacks to avoid ship defensive fire, but without success.9 In contrast, dive bombing continued to prove its merit. Adm. Joseph M. Reeves, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Fleet, wrote, "These dive bombers, equipped with 1,000-pound bombs, are probably the most deadly air weapon thus far devised." In exercises late in 1933, two squad- rons made mock dive-bombing attacks on the USS Lexington and Saratoga, scoring sixty-eight hits according to umpires. Powerful opponents of air power still controlled the exercises, because the umpires ruled that sixty- eight hits failed to sink either carrier. Such rulings could not obscure the obvious-the Navy was moving away from Norden-equipped horizontal bombers in favor of dive bombers. Against the battle cruiser division, bombers diving out of the sun from 12,000 feet met what observers de- scribed as ineffective antiaircraft fire and pressed their attacks without op- position. Reeves judged associated torpedo bomber attacks to be ineffec- tive: "Probably in all naval warfare there is nothing more difficult to deliver than a successful torpedo attack."10 In 1936 Reeves itemized the duties of carrier-borne aircraft,11 limiting torpedo attack to "just prior to the main engagement," and assigning dive bombers the primary responsibility for the destruction of enemy capital ships. Each carrier's contingent would include four aircraft squadrons: one squadron of VBFs (fighters with dive-bombing capability), two squadrons of VSBs (scout bombers with dive-bombing capability), and one squadron of VBs (dive bombers) or VT

Norden had not designed his bombsight for such a short bombing run. Commander of the 305th Bombardment Group Curtis E. LeMay re- fused to accept the inaccuracy evasive action over the target brought. He felt that "the only point in flying a bomber in this war . .. was to drop bombs where they would do the most harm to the enemy." Analysis of poststrike photographs revealed that American bombing was far from pre- cision; LeMay called it "stinko." But what to do? After several frustrating missions, the answer came to him in bed. Using an old ROTC artillery manual, he calculated the chances of a flak gun hitting a target the size of a B-17 at a distance of 25,000 feet. Guessing that it would take 372 shells to down an American bomber over the target, he determined that the chances of getting shot down while in level flight "didn't look too bad." Because the German 8.8-cm cannon had an opera- tional ceiling of about 20,000 feet, LeMay decided to substitute altitude for evasive maneuvers. Flying above 20,000 feet would reduce the threat, but could bombardiers still hit pickle barrels at that altitude? LeMay had to balance accuracy against the impulse for self- preservation. He ordered his group to ignore the threat of flak and ap- proach the target straight and level in a group formation. Staggering his aircraft in a tight "combat box" or "Javelin Down formation" uncovered the maximum number of defensive machine guns for protection against German fighters. Brig. Gen. Laurence S. Kuter, commanding general of the 1st Bomb Wing, organized LeMay's combat box of eighteen to twenty- one bombers into a combat wing of two or three combat boxes. These formations were "force multipliers," giving B-17s and B-24s a degree of protection from German fighters because of their overlapping fields of fire. Each formation would fly straight to their targets from the initial point, approximately 10 m
