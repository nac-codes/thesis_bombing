Partly this was because LeMay had run out of ammunition; partly because, like Harris before him, he was made by his superiors to divert some of his bombers to other missions. This time it was to mine Japan’s straits and harbors. For heavy four-engined machines to operate on such a mission was somewhat of an innovation but one that, using their now stan- dard low-ﬂying tactics, they carried out with great success. By May, mines of various types were sinking three Japanese ships per day. In May, the city raids were resumed. As Japanese resistance dimin- ished, LeMay felt conﬁdent enough to mount some of them in daylight so as to improve accuracy. Even before atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the total number of Japanese his men killed ex- ceeded 300,000. Adding the injured, probably over 1 percent of the entire population was physically hit. The list of targets included T okyo again— after 56 square miles of urban land had been razed, the city was no longer considered worth attacking—as well as Yokohama. Losses went down to an acceptable 2 percent. As had happened in Germany, and as was also to happen in Vietnam 20-something years later, in time the heavy bombers, joined by medium ones and ﬁghter-bombers operating from Okinawa, turned their attention to smaller and smaller objectives. By July, cities numbering just 100,000–200,000 inhabitants were being hit. The last ones to be attacked during the early days of August had fewer than 50,000. Two months earlier, in June, LeMay had already warned the Army Air Forces commander, General Hap Arnold, that he was about to run out of targets. In the whole of Japan, there were no cities of any size worth bombing left.23 Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the entire campaign was the vast scale on which it was conducted. Each of the dozens of city-burning mis- sions had to be prepared by many thousands of technicians and other per- sonnel. Eac

It was at Dunkirk that the Luftwaffe, unable to prevent the evacuation of over 300,000 British and French troops, suffered its ﬁrst real setback in the war. Much of this is attributable to the fact that the 850 aircraft, mostly ﬁghters, the British had held back from the battle of France were now avail- able to ﬁght the Germans over the English Channel. The RAF itself had changed greatly. We have left the service in 1937–38 when, partly because of Trenchard’s legacy and partly because the governments of the day hoped to deter Germany from going to war, it was still strongly committed to strategic bombing operations directed against enemy urban centers. At that point, a deus ex machina appeared. Having started in 1935, experiments with radar were already well under way. Almost from the beginning they were successful. By permitting incoming bombers to be detected in time for ﬁghters to scramble and meet them, they promised to change the entire nature of war in the air as it had been understood from the time of Douhet on.16 Thereupon the Air Ministry, through its control over the purse strings and the factories, forced the RAF into a near-complete change of direc- tion.17Fighter Command, long the RAF’s neglected stepchild, suddenly re- ceived priority over everything else.

T o this is added the fact that generals are extremely status conscious and tend to have huge egos. As Harris’s correspondence in particular demon- strates, they were not necessarily prepared to accept “a panacea plan de- vised by a civilian professor whose peacetime forte is the study of the sexual aberrations of the higher apes. ”32 In this respect, as in so many others, there may have been some differ- ences among the belligerents, and, pace Harris, of the ﬁve principal armed forces the ones most open to seek the advice of OR experts were those of Britain and the United States. Not accidentally, the societies they served were the least militarized and the ones that, in peacetime at any rate, held uniforms in relatively low esteem. Roosevelt and Churchill appointed sci- entiﬁc advisers, and some of their subordinates followed their example until having a scientist at one’s beck and call became something of a status symbol. On the other side of the hill, things were entirely different. Hitler never had a scientiﬁc adviser—with the result, as he himself commented, that he had to learn about the possibility of setting off a nuclear explosion from his postmaster general.33Many German and Japanese generals had too good an opinion of their profession, and of themselves, to allow civil- ians to tell them what to do.

They illustrate the above developments almost to perfection. The former grew out of a Japanese attempt to seize the British-held island of Tulagi as well as Port Moresby on New Guinea. The ultimate objective was to extend the protective ring around the newly won empire in Southeast Asia, gain a base from which Japanese aircraft could bomb northern Australia, and threaten communications between Australia and the United States. The Japanese T ask Force MO consisted of three carriers as well as assorted cruisers, destroyers, minesweepers, s ubmarines, a seaplane tender, and var- ious supply and transport vessels. The American T ask Force 17 had two carriers and a similar, if smalle r, array of warships, but no transports. This was the ﬁrst naval battle in which the naval forces of both sides never even sighted one another. Oper ating over vast distances and maneu- vering at high speed, they searched for one another by means of wireless interception and code breaking, rada r (the Americans), and land- and sea- based air reconnaissance. Once the enemy had been located, and assuming his position was not misreported a nd that he was not lost again or con- cealed by bad weather, they sent out their land- and sea-based aircraft. The trick, an intricate one depending on elaborate calculations of distance, speed, and time, was always to catch the other side’s aircraft while they were being refueled and re-equipped and thus unable to respond; insofar as doing so required high-quality, real-t ime intelligence that might not always be available, a good measure of luck was

Was strategic bombing the best way to use airpower, or was it merely a diversion from other forms of employing it, such as CAS and interdiction? Were the targets corr ectly selected, or would a different approach have led to better and faster results? What was the effect on the German conduct of the war, and how much did it contribute to victory? Could strategic bombing be morally justiﬁed? Proceeding in reverse order, if the raids on Cologne, Hamburg, Dresden, and so many other cities con- stituted war crimes, then so, without doubt, did the ones on Warsaw, Rot- terdam, London, Coventry, and Birmingham. Given how inaccurate the means of delivery of the time were, it was completely unrealistic to expect that targets hit would be exclusively, and in many cases even mainly, of a military nature. Bombing did not prove decisive in the sense of forcing Hitler and his government to surrender.14What it did do was to kill about 350,000 people and injure 800,000 more, render 10 percent of the popula- tion homeless, and paralyze many industr ies and transportation arteries. T o counter the strategic bombin g campaign, the Germans in 1944 used 55,000 guns and 2,100,000 men (900,000 in the defenses proper, 1.2 mil- lion in damage repair).15These were no mean ﬁgures, but whether they were gre

We left the Allied struggle to close the ring on the Axis in Europe at the time they invaded Italy, landing ﬁrst at Salerno and then at Anzio. T aking the Italian campaign as a whole, the performance of the Allied air forces proved disappointing. T o be sure, one German general writing not long after the war expressed the view that Allied air support at the beachhead, and later at the battle of Monte Cassino, was “magniﬁcent. ” He personally had witnessed the density of the bomb patterns, the accuracy with which they were delivered, and the destr uction they wrought.

Finally, was the U.S. method preferable to the British one, or vice versa? Again a deﬁnitive answer is very hard to get. One reason for this is that, in reality, precision bombing was not nearly as precise as its advocates claimed. Even according to the U.S. Official History of the Army Air Forces in World War II, the longer the campaign went on, the more the U.S. bombers found themselves engaged in RAF-  style area attacks.22 Historical truth is no doubt a very important thing to have. Neverthe- less, looking back, it would seem that the true signiﬁcance of these and sim- ilar questions does not consist of the answers that were provided for them either at the time or later. Instead, what matters is the fact that, for years and even decades after World War II had ended, they continued to form the framework for thinking about air warfare.23Later in this book we shall have occasion to see the “lessons” of the war being applied in subsequent ones: what part in the overall war effort that airpower should play, in wh

Both cities were of some importance as manufacturing centers, depots, and em- barkation ports. Hitherto they had been spared speciﬁcally so that the ﬁrst atom bombs could be tested on them and the precise results studied in de- tail. On the evening of August 5, the American crews were briefed amid heavy security. Tibbets’s plane, which he had dubbed Enola Gay after his mother, took off at 0245 on August 6. Six hours later, at 0840 in the morn- ing, it was ﬂying at 32,000 feet over Hiroshima. Earlier the city had been reconnoitered by a weather plane, which made sure everything was clear. The unintended result was to convince many people on the ground that the second American aircraft was nothing very dangerous, a fact that may well have prevented them from taking shelter and thus helped increase the number of casualties. Now everythin g worked just as planned; the bomb doors opened and Little Boy dropped out. Fifty-seven seconds later, having reached approximately 2,000 feet, it exploded. By that time Enola Gay was already 11.5 miles away and escaping as fast as it could. Even so, it was badly buffeted by the shock wave and the crew, afraid of being blinded, had to use goggles to observe their handiwork. As the doomed city disappeared under a mushroom cloud that rose to 60,000 feet, 75,000 people lay dead or dying. Later on, another estimated 75,000 died of their injuries or else as a result of the radiation they had re- ceived. Within a radius of one mile from point zero, only a few steel-framed buildings, built to resist earthquakes, remained standing. Yet even that was not the end of the horror.

Little is known about the Soviet Union in this respect, but it may well have stood somewhere in between. It always had excellent mathematicians and chess players. On the other hand, owing to its size and the relatively low educational level of its people, most of whom were only one step removed from the peasantry, it was inclined to solve military problems in a somewhat heavy-handed manner. In such a climate the ﬁnesse of OR may have played a lesser role in the conduct of the war. As it turned out, the Allies won the struggle in the air as they did those that were waged on the ground and at sea. Certainly the intelligence men, the scientists, the technicians, and the operational researchers contributed to the ﬁnal victory. Still there can be little doubt that the ultimate factor128 The Age of Airpower1586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 128 Van, Creveld, Martin.

Again referring to the industrial potential of the ﬁve main belligerents, the difference between the two sides was (3+1+0.8) to (1.2+0.5)=2.8:1. Again referring to the number of aircraft produced, the difference between them was 599,964 to 130,902, or almost 4.6 to 1. Even if we factor in the hapless Italians, these ﬁgures remain almost as they are. In one of his best-known equations Lanchester argues that, in modern war- fare, to offset a numerical handicap of two to one, an armed force needs to be not twice as good as its enemy, as common sense wo

OR was equally useful in plannin g and deploying anti-aircraft de- fenses, logistic systems, training sche dules, and, above all, communication systems. The following is a summary of a document that spelled out the results of applying OR to air attacks on submarines: 1. [Since a submarine only took 25 seconds to submerge] the attacking approach was to be made by the shortest path and at maximum speed. 2. The actual attack could be made from any direction relative to the U-boat. 3. The depth of setting of all depth-charges was to be 50 feet, the spac- ing of depth-charges in a stick was to be 60 feet and all depth charges carried were to be released in one stick. 4. The ideal was to attack while the U-boat or some part of it was still visible. Data was given, however, to enable pilots to estimate quickly how far ahead of the point of ﬁnal disappearance their stick should be placed if the U-boat got under just before release was possible. 5. In cases where the U-boat had disappeared for more than 30 seconds it was pointed out that success was unlikely owing to the progressive uncertainty of the U-boat’s position either in plan or depth. 6. The height of the release must not be greater than 100 feet.30 Though air warfare was better suited to OR than almost any other form of war, the extent of the role it played on the latter’s conduct remains diffi- cult to assess. Much depended on access to enemy information—in other words, knowledge of the results. Such knowledge might or might not be available. Throughout the war, pilots on all sides greatly exaggerated the number of enemy machines they had shot down.

Supposedly the Third Reich was governed by the Fuehrerprinzip, the leader principle, according to which decisions at all levels were made by a single man, and Hitler himself, standing at the top of the hierarchy, made the most important ones of all. In practice, owing not least to Hitler’s some- what lackadaisical leadership style, it tended to be surprisingly decentral- ized. Both before and during the war, this left plenty of room for the top ﬁgures to ﬁght ﬁerce turf battles among themselves. In the ﬁeld of aircraft production, Goering, as minister of aviation and commander in chief of the Luftwaffe (among his numerous other titles), fought the air inspector general, Erhard Milch, whom he once described as “a fart in my ass. ” Milch tried to impose some kind of order on leading manufacturers such as Heinkel, Messerschmitt, and Junkers. He was foiled by the fact that, making use of Hitler’s tendency to put his unde rstanding of technology on display,8 the heads of those and other ﬁrms had fairly easy access to him. In theory, they ought to have been coordinated by Udet as chief of the Luftwaffe’s technical office; in practice, as he himself complained not long before his death,9nobody listened to him. The outcome was that, long before 1939, each went his own way, ﬁghting all the rest for resources such as labor, en- ergy, raw materials, and factory space.10 This competition went on throughout the war. It led to an extremely in- efficient use of the chief raw material, aluminum, as well as endless dupli- cation and a very large number of prototypes, the great majority of which never entered production. Another res ult was constant modiﬁcations that disrupted production plans. Perhaps worst of all, after

In the whole of Japan, only 300 were available. On this and subsequent occasions Japanese pilots did what they could but were overwhelmed. Though LeMay may not have been familiar with the conclusions of the JTG in Washington,21he had loaded his aircraft with incendiaries. Almost 2,000 tons were released. So intensive was the resulting heat wave that it buffeted some aircraft—which, empty, turned the scales at 34 tons each—to a height of 1,500 feet above their predetermined course. The city, which until then had only suffered some 1,300 dead, became a blazing inferno in which at least 83,000 people perished. That was about equal to the ﬁgure that re- sulted from the destruction of Hamburg and Dresden combined. By the end of March, Nagoya, Japan’s third largest city, as well as Osaka and Kobe, had shared T okyo’s fate.

In April there was a pause. Partly this was because LeMay had run out of ammunition; partly because, like Harris before him, he was made by his superiors to diver

Surprisingly enough, the country that put the greatest emphasis on the air arm turns out to have been the Soviet Union. This even held true at the time U.S. production peaked, in 1944. Still following the same calculations, during the same year the Soviet Union should have produced 25,648 air- craft; instead, it came up with no fewer than 40,300. These ﬁgures represent a useful corrective to the oft-heard claim that the Soviet Union was basi- cally a land power that neither put sufficient resources into airpower nor, perhaps, fully grasped its signiﬁcance. The truth seems to be that, relative to the resources at their disposal, the Soviets devoted a greater effort to creating and maintaining its air force than did anyone else. Where they dif- fered was the purpose for which they planned airpower and used it—that is, at the front and comparatively close behind it. Still, given that three out of every four German soldiers killed in World War II met their fate at the hands of the Red Army, perhaps Stalin’s choice was not so bad after all. As much as the war in the air was a battle of factories, it was also a battle of wits. Throughout the years that it lasted, all the belligerents assiduously collected intelligence on the opposing air forces. Doing so, they made use of every possible method, including, to name but a few, perusing the media, agents’ reports, pilots’ reports, and captured enemy pilots’ reports. T o this were added technical intelligence (ﬁnding out whatever they could about the characteristics of enemy machines), photo intelligence, signals intelli- gence (SIGINT , reading enemy radio messages), electronic intelligence (ELINT , learning about the enemy from the frequency of his radio trans- missions, the direction from which they c ome, and so on), and much more.War of Factories, War of Wits 1211586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM

Anxious to conceal the exact point where the landings were to take place for as long as possible, he also decided that, for every sortie against the Normandy area, two would be ﬂown against other targets. Both bomber generals, the American Spaatz and the Briton Harris, ob- jected to the plan. Seeing it as yet another attempt to divert their crews and aircraft from their proper task of launching strategic attacks on German cities and industries, they claimed th at it would result in heavy casualties— also among France’s civilian population—and have little impact. But they were overruled. From March to June, 76,000 tons of ordnance rained down on the French transportation system. In the end, the effort was a consider- able, though not an absolute, success. On D-Day itself no fewer than 12,000 sorties were ﬂown by aircraft of all kinds, surely an all-time historical record. By that time every bridge over the Somme from Paris to the west had been demolished and rail traffic in the area had been reduced by almost two-thirds. T o the end of his life, Eisenhower r
