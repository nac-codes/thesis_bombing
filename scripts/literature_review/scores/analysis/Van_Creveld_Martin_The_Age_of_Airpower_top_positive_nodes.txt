Losses were immense and the confusion perhaps even greater; never in history has any air force met a worse disaster. For several weeks, even months, what operations the Red Army was still able to mount tended to be scattered, uncoordinated, frequently ineffective, and, at times, truly desperate. For example, large numbers of obsolete bombers were sent to attack the German spearheads and entire squadrons of them shot down like turkeys. As German intelligence had correctly per- ceived, a large part of the problem lay with the centralization of the com- mand system. Another was rooted in the fact that, before the war, the Red Army’s doctrine, whether the one centering on strategic bombing or the one that advocated deep operations, had been almost purely offensive. T aken by surprise by the outbreak of hostilities, the Stavka, the General Staff, in Moscow did not know how to use aircraft for defensive purposes. Stalin’s interference, which was always backed up by the not too remote possibility of drastic punishment for failure, did not help. By the time the battle of Smolensk was fought in mid-July the Red Air Force had fewer than 2,000 serviceable aircraft left. Still, as had also been the case in China and for many of the same reasons, Soviet air operations never came to a complete halt. Not every airﬁeld could be located and sub- jected to attack. Not every attack inﬂicted irreversible damage. So many aircraft having been destroyed on the ground, for a time the Soviets even had a surplus of trained pilots. Often operating under the most primitive conditions, they took off whenever they could, only to ﬁnd that their ma- chines, such as the I-16, Yak-1, and MiG-3 ﬁghters and the LaG-3 ground support aircraft, were no match for the Messerschmitts.

Even then it took some time before the U.S. Eighth Air Force changed its tactics, freed pilots from their close ties to the bombers, and allowed them to engage the German ﬁghters wherever they were found.8 In the summer of 1943, acting on Hitler’s direct instructions, the Luft- waffe shifted the emphasis from interdiction and CAS toward defending the Reich. Eventually 70 percent of all ﬁghter squadrons were so employed. The outcome was to leave much of the Wehrmacht’s ﬁeld formations with- out cover to match the growing airpower that the western Allies, and in their own way the Soviets too, were using against them; the few units that remained often consisted of inferior aircraft. Worse still, many of the anti- aircraft guns, especially the excellent 88-millimeter one, were dual-purpose. Consequently the front was starved of anti-tank weapons as well. As in other countries, the defenses consisted of ﬁghter aircraft, anti-aircraft ar- tillery units, and a civil defense. As in the Soviet Union, but unlike the sit- uation in Britain both during the Battle of Britain and later, the ﬁrst and the second of these were both under Luftwaffe command, facilitating co- ordination. Most of the night ﬁghters were Do-17, Ju-88, and Me-110 air- craft. None of them had been designed for the purpose, and by the end of the war all were obsolete; yet all had the advantage that, being twin en- gined, they were large enough to carr y radar sets. The pilots were directed to their targets by a series of control centers. Approaching, ﬁrst they would spot the enemy on their own radar screens and then, closing to within gun- shot, visually. The control centers in turn relied on data provided by a chain of layered, overlapping, interlocking radar sets ﬁrst established in 1940 and reaching from Denmark to central France.

The more time passed, the more technological progress and the introduction of more long-range aircraft limited the ocean spaces where submarines could operate in relative safety. Some historians claim that this factor was the most important reason why the Allies eventually came out on top.2As one German U-boat captain told his commander in chief, suc- cessful attacks on convoys were only possible as long as there were no Al- lied aircraft around.3 Another means for closing the gap were escort carriers—meaning small and relatively cheap ones—and so-called merchant aircraft carriers (MACs). The latter were simply merchantmen, often grain ships or tankers. They were converted for the purpose by being made to carry a catapult, a few antiquated Swordﬁsh biplanes, and a crane or two for lifting them out of the water once they had accomplished their mission. As often happens, their very simplicity and low cost caused them to be disliked by “real” navy commanders; no sooner had the war ended than the latter did what they could to make people forget they had existed at all. Nevertheless they were very effective. The record shows that no MAC-escorted convoy ever lost a ship to a submarine, nor was any MAC lost.4 Still other Coastal Command aircraft, operating from airﬁelds in the east- ern part of Britain, visited the submarine bases in an attempt to learn more about the submarines’ arrivals and departures. Often encountering intense anti-aircraft ﬁre, these aircraft suffered the heaviest losses. While many fac- tors playe

The Luftwaffe was also able to provide effective support to the ground forces in their ﬁght against the retreating Norwegians, particularly in the valleys between Oslo and Trondheim and Oslo and Bergen. The one thing it was unable to do was to prevent the British forces from being withdrawn; this was due above all to the near absence of specialized naval aviation as well as the fact that the Luftwaffe itself did not operate at night.6 On paper, the forces facing each other in the west appeared much more balanced than had been the case in Norway. The Germans had 3,578 aircraft— 1,563 bombers, 376 dive-bombers, 1,279 single-engine ﬁghters, 311 twin- engine ones, and 49 Schlachtﬂieger, or close support aircraft, in the form of Henschel 123 biplanes. Of those aircraft, 2,589 were operational. The Allies had 4,469, of which, however, only 1,453 were immediately ready for action.7The mystery as to why only 32 percent of the Allied aircraft in France, but a full 72 percent of the German ones about to attack them, could be thrown into the struggle is soon solved. Recalling the events of 1914–18, the French High Command believed that it was facing a long war in which the side with the last reserves would win. Hence they stationed almost three-quarters of their aircraft so far to the rear as to be out of the Luftwaffe’s reach. Unfortunately this meant that they were also unable to help in repelling the German invasion. Indeed not the least remarkable fea- ture of the “strange defeat,” as it has been called, was the fact that the Armée de l’ Air ended the campaign with more operational aircraft than it had at the beginning.8Qualitatively speaking, the Luftwaffe was about equal to the RAF but superior to the French, Belgian, and Dutch air forces. The French in particular did possess some modern aircraft, such as the Dewoi- tine D.520 ﬁghter, which were a match for the Messerschmitts.9However, owing to the above-mentioned consideration

In ad- dition, acting in the CAS mode, the group claimed to have destroyed 30 tanks and 488 motor vehicles. It also ﬂe w 90 sorties against artillery posi- tions. Another Kampfgeschwader, made up of Me-110 twin-engine ﬁghters, claimed to have destroyed 50 trains a nd four bridges over a slightly longer period. This came on top of 148 tanks, 266 guns, and 3,280 vehicles of var- ious kinds.38 There was a price to be paid for this—between August 10 and 21, VIII Fliegerkorps, trying to help the ground forces by cutting the main rail- road from Moscow to Leningrad, lost 10.4 percent of its aircraft. Another 54.5 percent were damaged but could be repaired.39As in World War I, the ﬂat, often featureless terrain made navigation difficult, but it also meant that cover was hard to ﬁnd, thus facilitating reconnaissance.

Often encountering intense anti-aircraft ﬁre, these aircraft suffered the heaviest losses. While many fac- tors played a role in the submarines’ ultimate defeat, probably the most im- portant one was a shortwave (decimetric) radar set known as SCR-517 introduced in the spring of 1943. Though its range in anti-submarine work was limited to six miles, for the ﬁrst time it enabled the aircraft carrying it to reliably and accurately locate submarines operating on the surface even at night, their favorite time in which to recharge their batteries and stalk their prey. Since a different version of this set, known as the H2S, was car- ried by Bomber Command in its raids over Germany it was feared that the Germans would be able to quickly capture it and counter it. As it turned out, a set was captured almost immediately, but a countermeasure was only built after eight months, because, as Goering himself was forced to admit,5Closing the Ring 1331586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 133 Van, Creveld, Martin.

After June 1943 the submarine menace ceased to play a major role in the war. This enabled the Allies to start closing the ring on Nazi-dominated Europe and begin sending massive troop-carrying convoys across the At- lantic. If no troop-carrying ship ever went to the bottom, then one reason for this was the air escort that the RAF and the USAAF provided for them.

But they were by no means universally welcomed; there were even claims that applying his ideas would turn the United States into a nation of baby killers.6Good, bad, or merely indifferent, U.S. doctrine concerning so- called precision daylight bombing was largely homegrown. USAAF com- manders insisted that, in the B-17 with its 13 machine guns, they had an aircraft capable of penetrating the defen ses in daylight and hitting targets much more accurately than could be done at night. It took several defeats to convince the Americans that they were barking up the wrong tree. The most serious one was the raid on Schweinfurt on October 14, 1943, when 60 (20.7 percent) out of 289 bombers were de- stroyed. Seventeen were irreparably damaged, and another 121 damaged but judged reparable. On this day alone, about 600 highly trained crew members were either killed or taken prisoner.7German production of ballClosing the Ring 1351586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 135 .

Out of 134 British gliders, 47 landed in the sea with heavy loss of life. Their activ- ities made little impression either on the Italians, who surrendered with hardly a shot, or on the Germans, who fought with their usual tenacity. On the Eastern Front, too, the largest Soviet airborne operation, mounted at Burkina in the Ukraine in September 1943 and lasting into November, was not a great success either. Perhaps the most successful airborne operation took place in Nor- mandy in June 1944, when British paratroopers and glider-borne troops, sent to capture bridges, road crossings, and key terrain features, achieved all their objectives and held most of them against German counterattacks until help arrived. Their American colleagues were not as fortunate. So scattered and confused did they become that their divisional commanders were only ever able to gather 2,500 men out of 13,000; consequently their operations only amounted to pinpricks. For all sorts of airborne opera- tions, the turning point came at Arnhem three months later. Operation Market Garden, as it was called, involved no fewer than 34,600 U.S., British, Canadian, and Polish troops.40It was much the largest of its kind ever at- tempted. Yet intelligence failures caused it to run into ﬁerce resistance by armored SS troops. It never achieved its objectives of securing the bridges over the Dutch rivers and cost the Allies at least 15,000 casualties. T o make things worse, these were enormously expensive operations. Not only is air transport the most costly form of transport—to say nothing of losses—but organizing it entailed selecting the cream of the available manpower, pro- viding them with special training, and keeping them in reserve—and thus out of combat—for months on end un til a suitable opportunity for their employment arose.Closing the Ring 1511586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 151 Van, Creveld, Martin.

The RAF could keep many of its ﬁghter squadrons in north and west England and Wales, where they were out of range of most of the Luftwaffe’s aircraft; compared with the German need to coordinate bombers and ﬁghter escorts with their very different characteristics, sending up ﬁghters to counter them was simple. German pilots shot down over England were invariably lost. By contrast, British ones, provided they managed to crash-land or parachute to earth, were often able to ﬁght another day. Occasional help came from Ultra, the organization responsible for monitorin g, intercepting, and deciphering German military wireless traffic in general and that of the Luftwaffe in par- ticular. Yet perhaps the most important single factor was the failure of the Germans, whose aircraft were equipped for offense rather than defense, to recognize the critical role that the Chain Home radar stations were playing in the battle. Had they attacked those stations ﬁrst of all and sustained the offensive, preventing them from being repaired, the outcome might well have been different.20 The turning point in the battle came early in September. The RAF in- ﬂicted such heavy losses on the Luftwaffe, its bombers in particular, that it had to switch from day to night bombing. Yet in the Second World War, as in the First, bombers operating by  night could not hit their targets nearly as accurately as those operating by day. Any attempt to focus on militarily and economically valuable ones became a question of sheer luck. The sig- nal was given by a German squadron that had lost its way and struck Lon- don. In response Churchill, who had become prime minister in May 1940, sent the RAF to bomb Berlin.

As with the night defenses, radar sets detected the bomber swarms when the y were still as much as 60 miles away (the fact that they were coming was noted much earlier, given that the radio traffic they generated was easily interc epted).

By the end of the year the German High Com- mand claimed to have destroyed no fewer than 20,392 enemy aircraft. As opposing narratives go, this is remarkably close to the 21,200 mentioned in Soviet sources. The cost to the Luftwaffe was 2,505 aircraft lost. Another 1,895 were damaged, but since the Germans were on the offensive and con- stantly overrunning more and more territory they must have been able to recover and repair more of them than the Soviets did.45Thus the overall balance was almost ﬁve-to-one in favor of the Luftwaffe. Yet it was already beginning to feel the weight of the British air offensive in the west that was eventually to force it almost entirely on the defensive. Much worse for the Germans, in 1941 their output of aircraft was lower than that of the Soviet Union—11,776 versus 15,735—and only slightly higher than it had been in 1940.46It is true that, across the board, Soviet aircraft remained inferior.

Depending on geography, national objectives, the characteristics of enemies and allies, doctrine, and so on, some belligerents put much greater emphasis on their air forces as opposed to the older two services. Some belligerents focused on relatively small and cheap single- and twin-en gine machines; others, again for vari- ous reasons, produced a greater number of large, heavy, and expensive four-engine ones. The precise mixture was not necessarily ﬁxed but might change sharply over the years. Brieﬂy, a detailed comparison of the number of aircraft produced by the various c ountries is both impossible and mean- ingless. On the other hand, since God so often supports the large battalions, there is no alternative to trying our hand at it in spite of all the difficulties. Not much needs to be said here about the two smallest powers, France and Italy. From 1937 until 1939 inclusive, France produced 4,288 aircraft against Germany’s 19,136 and Britain’s 12,920.2In the next year, the coun- try was knocked out of the war. French aviation ﬁrms such as Amiot, Morane-Saulnier, and Potez continued to work and certainly made some contribution to the Luftwaffe’s order of battle. However, for various rea- sons, productivity was abysmally low; it took four times as many man- hours to assemble the same aircraft in France as it did in Germany. Consequently the number of French-built aircraft that the Germans were able to put their hands on was rather small, never exceeding 100 per month. Much more important were French de liveries of bauxite and aluminum. Were it not for those critically important raw materials, the German aircraft industry could never have expanded as much as it did or maintained output for nearly as long as it did.

As more than one record, both contemporary and postwar, by Ger- man pilots shows, hunting bombers could be great fun.10Reading British participants’ memoirs of the Battle of Britain, one sometimes gets a similar impression.11The situation of the bomber crews was quite different. As one U.S. aviator, the navigator Lieutenant James Goff, wrote: I can remember few speciﬁc details of those terrifying twenty-ﬁve minutes over Muenster [in October 1943] when all hell broke loose. My mouth felt as though it was full of cotton, and in spite of the numbing subzero temperature, I was perspiring freely. I can recall slipping and sliding on the growing mound of shell casings as I moved hastily and clumsily from the left nose gun to the right nose gun and back again. I found later that I’d ﬁred some 1,600 rounds. IfClosing the Ring 1371586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 137 Van, Creveld, Martin. The Age of Airpower, PublicAffairs, 2011.

Yet conditions were entirely different. Whereas the battle for Demyansk took place toward the beginning of spring so that the weather could be expected to improve, that for Stalingrad got under way just when winter was setting in. Whereas the troops at Demyansk needed a minimum of 265 tons a day to survive, the 220,000 at Stalingrad needed at least twice as much. Flying in and out of the city, the distances the aircraft had to cover were also much longer. Mobilizing every aircraft and every crew, braving nights that were be- coming increasingly longer, atrocious weather conditions, and growing So- viet resistance in the air and from the ground, the Luftwaffe, still ﬂying mostly obsolescent Ju-52s, did what it could. However, during the entire period when the air-bridge was in operation only once did it succeed in de- livering as much as 280 tons, whereas the daily average stood at a mere 90 tons. T oward the end, as more and mor e airﬁelds were lost to the advanc- ing Soviet columns, the Germans were reduced to dropping supplies by parachute, with the result that many were lost or fell into enemy hands. None of this could save the doomed Sixth Army; by the time it surren- dered, the Luftwaffe’s transport command, having lost almost 500 aircraft and many experienced crews, had received a blow from which it would never recover.35 The last occasion when the Luftwaffe on the Eastern Front was able to intervene effectively in the ground battle was at Kursk in July 1943, when it saved the German Ninth Army from encirclement and possibly annihi- lation.

They also thought that Soviet an- cillary equipment such as radios and navigation aids was on the primitive side, and in this, too, they turned out to be correct. Soviet organization was judged as being heavy-handed, overcentralized, and inﬂexible, Soviet train- ing as below par. Where they were wrong was in their belief that, once the industrial centers in the USSR’s western provinces had been overrun, So- viet production, including the production of aircraft, would all but collapse. As it turned out, they could not have made a greater mistake. As in Poland, Norway, and the west, the Luftwaffe started the war with a devastating strike directed against Soviet airﬁelds—by the end of the ﬁrst week, the number of those attacked reached 130. Then and later the Ger- man aircraft, the Stukas in particular, ﬂew as many as four, ﬁve, six, or even seven missions per day—astonishing ﬁgures made possible by the relatively simple construction of the machines, the excellent training of the ground crews, and a special apparatus that allowed no fewer than nine aircraft to be refueled at the same time. The Armed Forces High Command proudly claimed the elimination of 4,017 Soviet aircraft against the loss of just 150 of their own; by July 9, the Soviets, in a highly unusual statement, admitted that 3,985 had been destroyed.37Most of the losses were incurred on the ground; however, entire Red bomber squadrons, ﬂying without escort in a desperate attempt to stop the Wehrmacht, were shot down. Whatever the precise ﬁgures, clearly command of the air was won easily and at a low cost. As early as June 25, the Luftwaffe began allocating part of its sorties to sup- port the army’s ground operations by attacking the Soviet transportation system in particular. Since the Luftwaffe’s central archives were destroyed at the end of the war, all we have is the scattered records of individual units. T ake the case of a Kampfgeschwader (bomb

Even so, there was plenty to be done before the bombers could land and take off again. Runways had to be built—the heavy machines needed no less than one and a half miles, considerably more than any aircraft in history until then. With runways came a demand for parking spaces, command-and-control installations, repair-and-maintenance facil- ities, depots, and quarter s for the personnel. All of these went up with amazing speed; indeed throughout the Paciﬁc War a major advantage the Americans enjoyed was their extensive use of earthmoving machinery to construct bases on newly conquered island s. By contrast, the Japanese re- lied on gangs consisting of thousands of half-naked men laboring in the sun—with the result that they took weeks to accomplish what the Ameri- cans did in days. The ﬁrst B-29s left the islands on their way to attack Japan in November. However, their efforts, based on the same theories as had governed the use of B-17s in Europe and aiming at the d estruction of large industrial instal- lations, were not a success. Thanks to their pressurized cabins, a techno- logical ﬁrst, they could cruise comfortably at 30,000 feet and more. But at this altitude they ran straight into what was later known as the jet stream. Severe buffeting and problems in navigation also made aiming very diffi- cult. Most of the time, the aviators had no idea where their bombs had gone. As one story has it, so many bombs missed their intended targets and fell into T okyo Bay that the city’s residents told one another that the Allies had decided to reduce them to starvation by killing all the ﬁsh.18Owing to the weather, many missions had to be canceled or aborted. Even so, weak though the opposition was, losses were not negligible but ran at a steady 4.5 percent per mission. Thus things continued until January 1945, when the Army Air Forces kicked out the c ommander and brought in a new one, Major General Curtis E. LeMay. Not yet 38 years

Consequently when the two battleships and the four destroyers that escorted them left Singapore to hunt for the Japanese, they did so without air support of any kind. Except for radar, which as it happened did not function very well, they were blind. Unsurprisingly, in- stead of locating the Japanese they themselves were discovered by a Japa- nese submarine. The latter radioed their location, speed, and course to headquarters, and the rest followed. Of the two ships, the Repulse was relatively old, having been launched in the midst of World War I. Since then, however, she had been reﬁtted sev- eral times, speciﬁcally in order to strengthen her defenses against air attack. By contrast, the Prince of Wales was among the most powerful gun-carrying naval platforms anywhere. She incorporated the latest in anti-aircraft and anti-torpedo defenses, including both gu ns and specially designed under- water armor. Yet this did not prevent her from becoming one of the two ﬁrst capital ships ever sunk solely by airpower in the open sea; as a result, in the vast naval battles that followed, battleships, to the extent that they were present at all, were overshadowed by the carriers. On the Japanese side, this even applied to the largest battleships ever built, the Yamato and Musashi, both of which had their short, but exciting, careers terminated by U.S. Navy aircraft. On the American one, it meant that the big gunships’ principal remaining use was not in the ﬂeet actions for which they had been designed but in providing cover to amphibious landings by bombarding coastal defenses.From Carrier War to Grande Finale 1571586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 157 Van, Creveld, Martin.

This, however, does not mean that they were always ineffective. For example, the Shturmovik, whose armor made it par- ticularly hard to shoot down, was the only World War II plane constructed in such a way that the armor actually contributed to its strength, leading to a weight saving of approximately 15 percent. Even if some Soviet aircraft were relatively ineffective, at any rate they were expendable and, therefore, usable. Standing like a colossus, the most successful World War II producer of aircraft—as of practically everything else—was the United States. In 1940, a total of 12,804 machines left the assembly lines, 26,277 in 1941, 47,836 in 1942, 85,898 in 1943, 96,318 in 1944, and 49,761 in 1945. At peak, there- fore, one aircraft did so every ﬁve minutes, 24 seconds. Furthermore, this output was perhaps more varied than that of any other country: it consisted of small aircraft, large aircraft, single-engine aircraft, multi-engine aircraft, combat aircraft, noncombat aircraft, land-based aircraft, and carrier-based aircraft. Nothing like it had ever been seen before; nothing like it has been seen since, and almost certainly nothing even remotely resembling it will ever be seen in any kind of future. As with every other country, this is not to say that perfect coordination of all production factors was achieved. The mere title of one book, The Mess in Washington , ought to rule out any such belief.19A look at the index shows that the aviation industry suffered from labor shortages, disastrousWar of Factories, War of Wits 1191586489816-Van Creveld_Layout 1  1/21/11  11:09 AM  Page 119 Van, Creveld, Martin.
