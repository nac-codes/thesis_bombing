File: --- parks_preciscion.pdf --- Page 2 --- 146 AIRPOWER: THEORY AND PRACTICE USAAF use of 'precision' and like terms was misleading or at least lack­ ing in necessary clarity. 'Precision' bombing is an artful expression. Precision is defined as the quality or state of being precise; the degree with which an operation is performed or a measurement stated (e.g., the number 2.42 shows a higher precision than 2.4, but is not necessarily more accurate); contrast with accuracy. Accuracy is defined by the same source as the quality, state or degree of being accurate, e.g., the accuracy of a firearm is its ability to deliver a close group of hits on target. Any distinction that may have existed between precision and accuracy was blurred in the American description of its strategic bombing operations against Germany, to the extent that the terms became synonymous. For example, the current Oxford English Dictionary defines precision as the fact, condition or quality of being precise; exactness ... accuracy ... Usually implying an intended or actual precision or performance [or] execution ... e.g., strategic bombing as carried out by the American 8th and 15th Air Forces in Europe was 'precision bombing' ...

Spaatz substituted the terms 'overcast bombing technique', 'bombing through overcast', or 'bombing with navigational devices over clouds extending up to 20,000 feet'. Thereafter resort to a selective form of area attack increased markedly. Targets designated for attack by mission planners largely were dependent upon weather at the target. Area bombing targets -railroad marshalling yards and industrial areas-ranked first and fourth, respectively, in overall tonnage delivered by Eighth Air Force in its strategic offensive. From November 1943 to April 1945, marshalling yards ranked first in weight of bombs among 12 target categories in 8 of the 8 months. Industrial areas were first in five  File: --- parks_preciscion.pdf --- Page 10 --- 154 AIRPOWER: THEORY AND PRACTICE months, even though the overall weight of bombs was less than oil, chemical and rubber targets. Of the 194,928 tons directed against marshalling yards, 124,865 tons (64 per cent) were delivered by blind bombing; of the 69,865 tons directed against industrial areas, 37,814 tons (54 per cent) were delivered by blind bombing.19 The US Strategic Bombing Survey was candid about the spin Eighth Air Force was putting on its operations:20 In many cases bombs dropped by instruments in 'precision' raids fell over a wide area comparable to ...

If the specific target was, for example, a marshalling yard located in a German city, as often happened, such a raid had a practical effect of an area raid against that city, but on the basis of the declared intention of the attackers it would go into the air force records as a precision attack on the transportation system. As Spaatz's biographer Richard Davis correctly concluded, '"Marshalling yards" was a USAAF euphemism for city areas.

W.HAYSPARKS In the April 1945 issue of Impact (an official US Army Air Forces [USAAF] publication), an article entitled 'RAF is a Potent Bombing Partner' offered this back-handed praise of the Royal Air Force's Bomber Command: Where American bombers in 1943 and 1944 were the pin-point specialists and the RAF employed their saturation tactics, the two forces now operate in a much similar fashion. The successful joint oil and aircraft production campaign now permits the RAF to operate around the clock with relative impunity and to practice daylight bomb­ ing as devastating as Eighth Air Force's best.' The quote reveals an underlying desire among USAAF leaders to compare themselves favorably to their British allies, and to pronounce their bombing methods superior. The USSAF was anxious to identify itself as the practitioner of 'pin-point' bombing methods in the European campaign. In large measure, it was successful in creating this image during and after the war. Today, most people with a passing familiarity with World War II bomb­ ing in Europe tend to characterise the British as the 'city busters,' and the Americans as the 'precision bombers'.' Such an overdrawn distinction conceals many of the realities of the campaign. When it existed, the distinction in RAF Bomber Command and USAAF bomber emphasis was between a general area offensive and selective bomb­ ing. Selective bombing concentrated on a group of related targets, all of which were associated with the same activity; that is, a target system. The philosophy of selective attack was that it was believed preferable to 'cause a high degree of destruction in a few really essential industries than a small degree of destruction in many industries'. General attack was based upon a belief that 'there really were no key points in the German war economy whose destruction could not be remedied by dispersal, the use of st

Doolittle cautioned: There is often a tendency on the part of planners to measure destruction by tons of bombs dropped rather than by bombs on targets. This must be assiduously guarded against in connection with 'through the overcast' bombing. Our experience to date with this type of bombing technique indicates that it is closely allied with area bombing and does not lend itself to the precision bombing of pinpoint targets. We have not been able, with regulari­ ty, to take out precision targets using Oboe, GH or H2X. On those occasions when we have hit a precision target it has been largely luck.

The image sought by the latter air forces and their superiors clearly was one of being more accurate than RAF Bomber Command's night-time general area offensive, and by a substantial margin. Questions remain, however, as to whether the US heavy bomber forces were as accurate as they portrayed themselves, and whether -when a fair comparison is made -they were more accurate than RAF Bomber Command. The British did prosecute a general area offensive against Germany, and the Americans did follow -much of the time, at least -a policy of selective targeting against military and industrial installations thought to be contri­ buting directly to the German war effort. But the image conveyed by the word precision is inappropriate to describe USAAF heavy bomber practice. Enemy defences kept the American daylight bombers from achieving the results they sought, and the consistently poor European weather regularly forced the Americans to bomb using radar aids-a practice that inevitably led to unsatisfactory results as the Americans were not as well trained, equipped, or experienced as the British in radar-bombing techniques.

This contradiction with the public image projected by the USAAF leadership may be explained by the fact that, except for French ports containing U-boat bases, the British general area bombing campaign was limited to targets in Germany.9 USAAF accuracy claims were qualified by deletion of targets of oppor­ tunity and two categories of errors. Targets of opportunity were bombed if the assigned target could not be attacked. A target of opportunity was selected by the mission leader, and included marshalling yards in urban areas and city centres. Mission failures were missions in which no box in an attack­ ing force was able to place more than five per cent of its bombs within 1,000 feet of its aiming point; a circular error by a combat box in excess of 3,000 feet on a mission was termed a gross error. Mission failures and gross errors were omitted from any analysis of accuracy. These failures were the product of both mechanical and human error, and increased with combat. They also could be intentional; because bombs dropped on a target of opportunity were not measured against a unit's accuracy, cases were reported in which bomb leaders elected to bomb a target of opportunity if doubt existed as to identifi­ cation of the aiming point of the primary target, in part to protect the unit's rating in accuracy comparisons.10 RAF Bomber Command also discounted gross errors, but with a broader definition (bomb falls which did not conform to the general pattern of bomb falls laid down in the mission). A distinction existed in the degree of gross error, however, due undoubtedly to the American practice of navigating to a target by group as compared to individual navigation by RAF Bomber Command crews; when a US formation leader suffered a navigation error or prematurely released his bombs, the entire group tended to follow his lead. These omissions from bombing accuracy ranged from 20 to 50 per cent for Eighth Air Force, while 14

'21 As the war continued, blind bombing of marshalling yards increased sub­ stantially (Figure 1), in part because USAF statistical summaries following the February 1945 attack on Dresden ceased to refer to 'industrial areas', lumping those attacks under 'marshalling yards'. 22 From September 1944 to VE Day marshalling yards were the most heavily bombed target in every month but one. 'Marshalling yards' accounted for 28.4 per cent (194, 928 tons) of the total USAAF heavy bomber tonnage (679, 392 tons), more than twice that of any other target category; blind bombing predominated by a wide margin. In contrast, 83 per cent (21, 865 tons) of the 26,479 tons directed by Eighth Air Force against aircraft factories were released visually, indicating the desire to direct the most effective bombing against targets requiring greater precision. Ninety-two per cent of the total bomb tonnage that fell within 1,000 feet of the aiming point was the result of visual bombing. The effectiveness of the two bombing methods can be discerned from US Strategic Bombing Survey estimates that of the tonnage delivered visually against marshalling yards, 25.19 per cent fell within I ,000 feet of the aiming point; of the tonnage delivered by blind methods, two per cent hit within 1,000 feet of the aiming point. The USAAF leadership knew blind attack was an inaccurate method of bombing. But it was a way in which pressure could be maintained on Germany, and they believed it was better than no bombing at all.

The period from then until the end of 1944 offers the best comparison of bombing accuracy between the two air forces. These were mature forces; bomber forces were able to operate with long-range fighter escort and/or air superiority, minimising the distracting effect on bombing accuracy of enemy fighters; and while Harris continued to place undue emphasis on general area attacks, both forces engaged in selective attack of some of the same targets. US heavy bomber operations against Germany between September and December 1944 emphasised attacks on oil and transportation targets, including marshalling yards. Bomber Command continued to focus on German cities, with 53 per cent of its effort devoted to area attacks upon large industrial cities -in large measure due to Harris' continued faith in the general area offensive, partly in acknowledgement of how adverse weather hindered precision attack accuracy. The balance was devoted to various strategic and tactical targets: 14 per cent was directed at oil targets, 15 per cent at railways and canals, 13 per cent at support for allied ground forces, and 5 per cent at naval targets and miscellaneous objectives. RAF missions against oil and transportation targets were executed both at night and during the day as precision rather than area attacks

This practice of 'bombing on leader' was tested on 3 January 1943, and generally adopted by all groups over the next three months. While it increased the percentage of bombs that fell within 1,000 feet of each aiming point, accuracy was one-third that possible with individual bomb runs, resulting in bomb pattern dimen­ sions of 1 ,500 feet in length and breadth for each combat box under optimum visual bombing conditions. 'Pickle barrel' accuracy yielded to pattern bomb­ ing.' Early missions made it apparent that bombing regarded as 'accurate' might not produce a corresponding measure of damage to the target; bombs landing between vital portions of a target might be gauged as 'accurate' because they fell within I ,000 feet of the aiming point, but in fact cause no damage because they struck open areas. Accuracy was relative, depending on the position of the observer. On Eighth Air Force's second mission against the Rouen-Sotteville marshalling yard (5 September 1942), 80 percent of the force's bombs fell outside the marshalling yard and into the city, killing as many as 140 civilians and wounding another 200. Eighth Air Force claims of 'precision' bombing were not particularly appreciated by the French, who were justifiably sceptical about the ability to bomb accurately from 25,000 feet. It was a problem that would plague US heavy bombers striking targets in proximity to friendly civilians or Allied ground forces throughout the war; high-altitude formation bombing was not a precision tool.

Over large urban areas the entire screen was filled with an 'intense blaze of response' that precluded identification of specific targets or aiming points, except for certain targets with pronounced radar features, such as the shoreline of a large body of water. The problem was exacerbated as altitude increased. 25 The suggestion that Eighth and Fifteenth Air Force Pathfinder aircraft could detect and accurately attack a marshalling yard in a major urban area (such as Berlin) using H2X through 10/lOths cloud from 25,000 feet or higher assumes target acquisition and bombing accuracy capabilities beyond those that existed.26 For example, the 29 April 1944 Eighth Air Force attack on Berlin by 570 B-17s and B-24s pur­ portedly aimed at railway facilities in the Friedrichstrasse section in the city centre. Only one of the eleven combat wings placed its bombs closer than five miles from the assigned aiming point.27 Although operational unit emphasis on use was high, the US H2X program never experienced the high-level or scientific enthusiasm and support H2S enjoyed in the United Kingdom. Early British H2S results could not be dupli­ cated in American tests, leading to strong US opposition to H2S development. As the British were completing its development in June 1942, they were diverted from their work by an American allegation that H2S research was the result of 'personal irresponsibility for a mad enterprise which was unscientific.' The US recommendation was that all H2S work cease. 2" Even after H2S had proved itself, there remained considerable scepticism about H2S at the highest US levels. In Washington, HQ USAAF halved Eighth and Fifteenth Air Force requests for H2X; even with these reductions, manufacturing schedules remained behind demand.29 RAF Bomber Command had equipped more than 90 per cent of its aircraft with H2S by the time of the  Fi

Blind bombing data from 15 October to 15 December 1943 indicates that only 6 of 151 combat boxes dropped their bombs within one mile of the aim­ ing point; 17 within 2 miles; and 30 or not quite 20 per cent, within five miles -a record no better than that recorded for night-bombing RAF crews in the Butt Report two years earlier. Blind bombing permitted US heavy bombers in December 1943 to drop more bombs than in any preceding month despite bad weather, but a report (31 January 1944) concluded that blind-bombing missions had averaged only five per cent of the bombs falling within five miles of the aiming point -accuracy worse than that recorded for Bomber Command in the Butt Report. 24 Despite its inaccuracy, the USAAF relied heavily on H2X. Of the American attacks against Germany, radar was responsible for 61 per cent of all bomb tonnage; of the 61 per cent, 81 per cent was delivered using H2X.

Conclusion One cannot help but speculate on why the USAAF leadership went so far out of its way to distinguish American bombing from that of RAF Bomber Command, and to mischaracterise the effort of its ally (and its own) in the process. The USAAF leadership was anxious to distance itself from Bomber Command's general area offensive. The Royal Air Force gained its indepen­ dence in 1918, while this remained an unobtained (and perhaps unobtainable) goal for the Americans. USAAF leaders knew that the role of airpower would be re-examined in any postwar debate over military service roles and mis­ sions, and in fighting for its independence. They did not wish to be tarred with the same brush as Bomber Command should there be postwar reappraisals of the strategic bomber offensive. In this they were prophetic; RAF Bomber Command was denied postwar honors, and the US Air Force gained its independence in 1947. Certainly there were other reasons. The American air leadership was under considerable pressure from senior British officials and the US Navy to join hands with Bomber Command in a general area offensive, an operation they recognised as less efficient and for which they had neither prepared nor trained. Moreover, they sincerely believed in what they sought to achieve. USAAF emphasis on precision bombing undoubtedly was necessary, too, as a leadership tool to encourage crews to 'press on regardless', and do the best job possible under difficult circumstances. There were differences in the approach to strategic bombing of the Americans and British. Neither was necessarily all right, or completely wrong, at the time each embarked upon their respective paths. Each was subject to operational constraints, not the least of which were the tenacity of the German air defences and the vagaries of weather. The crews of each risked their lives, day after day, or n

A WPD-1, the 1941 USAAF air war plan, reflected Air Force doctrine and public statements by emphasising daylight visual attack against selected targets in order to destroy the industrial and economic infrastructure of Germany. But the USAAF blueprint suffered the experience of a 'reality check' in its execution. Bombing accuracy had to be balanced against force survival, and offensive objectives against defensive requirements. American bombers flew to their targets in formation, attacking in combat boxes (generally 18 to 21 aircraft). Early bombing procedure was for the combat wing to split into combat boxes at the Initial Point, complete the bomb run in a combat box, then reassemble the combat wing at the Rally Point. The lead aircraft in each combat box controlled the direction and path the formation took to its target; the bombardier in each plane, sighting visually, was responsible for delivering his bombs on to the target. Formations were not maintained on the bomb run, as each aircraft manoeuvred for accurate sighting. For defensive and other operational reasons individual sighting was abandoned; the combat box maintained its tight formation, with each aircraft dropping its bombs on signal from its lead aircraft. This practice of 'bombing on leader' was tested on 3 January 1943, and generally adopted by all groups over th
