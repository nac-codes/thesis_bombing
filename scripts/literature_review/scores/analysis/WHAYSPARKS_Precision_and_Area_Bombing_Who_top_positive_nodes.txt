Eighth Air Force bombers had an overall weather abort rate of 10.4 per cent, and Fifteenth Air Force 12.9 per cent, in contrast to RAF Bomber Command's 1.3 per cent. Weather affected accuracy in that only about one-half of Eighth Air Force bomber sorties were able to bomb their targets visually; as will be shown, its non-visual accuracy figures were not good. Visual bombing ranged from 94 per cent of missions in August 1944 to 10 per cent in November 1944, to illustrate the seasonal variation that occurred. Weather also varied between day and night by season. In winter months RAF Bomber Command (bombing at night) had an approximately three times greater chance than Eighth Air Force (operating by day) of bombing a target visually, while Eighth Air Force had a 1.5 times better chance of bombing visually than Bomber Command in the summer months." Any cloud cover decreased bombing accuracy, and cloud cover of 5/10 or more became a primary cause of error. It was virtually impossible for the Eighth Air Force to bomb visually if cloud cover exceeded 5/1 0; an accurate attack was possible only when skies were clear and bombs could be aimed visually. Alternative bombing techniques, such as offset aiming, met with mixed results; crews tended not to want to bomb offset, hoping instead for a lucky visual acquisition of the target. 16 Non-Visual Bombing Aids The RAF tested a radar navigation device in 1936-37, and identified a need for aids to non-visual navigation and bombing as early as 1938.

But the most impor­ tant factor affecting mission accomplishment was weather, and the effect of weather on USAF bomber accuracy was greater than on RAF Bomber Command. RAF Bomber Command found that European weather significantly affected its early operations, and advised the authors of A WPD-1 of its experience; European weather was recognised in A WPD-1 as influencing planning and execution, just as the American World War I strategic bombing plan ('the Gorrell Plan') had acknowledged its importance. Early US heavy bomber operations were seriously hampered by the weather, to the extent that General Dwight D. Eisenhower (Commander, European Theater of Operations, US Army) advised Major General Carl A. Spaatz (Commander,  File: --- parks_preciscion.pdf --- Page 7 --- 'PRECISION' AND 'AREA' BOMBING 151 Eighth Air Force) on 7 October 1942 that the necessity for good weather was that command's 'only one real weakness', a point acknowledged by General Eaker at Casablanca and in correspondence with USAAF Chief General H. H. Arnold. 14 Weather was the major adverse operational factor during 1943 operations, and remained a controlling factor once US heavy bomber capabilities reached full maturity in spring 1944. The number of days on which operations could be executed, the area(s) that could be attacked, force size, attack timing and bombing method were determined primarily by weather. Weather restrictions on visual bombing limited accuracy and, concomitantly, the amount of destruction likely to be achieved. Weather particularly affected USAAF bomber forces.

Each RAF designee received a rigorous six-month training course in which he was taught by experts in navigation and radar bombing. Before participating in Pathfinder missions, he had to obtain specified accuracies on a test of practice missions. In the Eighth Air Force, H2X operator training consisted of a four-week course conducted by homeward bound personnel, their overseas tours extended for one to three months so that they could train their successors. These extensions seriously affected the morale of most, and few were of value for more than a few weeks. Quality suffered further in that training was not as comprehensive as that for bombardiers, even though the H2X equipment was more complicated than the Norden bombsight and required a greater degree of skill if it was to be exploited to its maximum potential."

But enthusiasm and interest suffered at levels above the Eighth and  File: --- parks_preciscion.pdf --- Page 14 --- 158 AIRPOWER: THEORY AND PRACTICE Fifteenth Air Forces, and in the echelon between their commanders and operators. Efforts to enhance H2X performance, such as development of a synchronous bombing method for co-ordinating information acquired through the H2X with the Norden bombsight (for use where some visual acquisition was possible), and a radar-mapping programme to produce target overlays, failed to improve US blind-bombing accuracy. Throughout the European War, US blind-bombing accuracy remained at approximately five per cent of the forces placing their bombs within 1,000 feet of the aiming point. Mission failures and gross errors increased, but remained uncounted in accuracy figures; thus the five per cent figure does not accurately represent actual performance. 32 RAF Bomber Command Selective Attack Accuracy Through 1943 RAF Bomber Command remained committed t

Other German defensive measures, such as decoys, camouflage, and smoke were successful in denying American bomber forces the accuracy desired.

The US program also was hampered by personnel problems. Just as the blind-bombing program was getting underway in the autumn of 1943, moves were afoot to close down the operational training unit at Langley Field, Virginia, needed for H2X operators, much to the consternation of General Eaker. One year later, personnel requirements for H2X operators could not be fulfilled; 124 H2X operators were required in November 1944, for example, yet none had arrived by 22 November, and only 44 were scheduled to arrive in each of November and December.

The solution was to make use of radar aids to night navigation. The impetus came with the 1941 Butt Report, which was highly critical of Bomber Command accuracy. Its examination of RAF night bombing missions in June and July 1941 found that of total sorties only one in five arrived within five miles of the assigned target. It prompted high-level interest, including that of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who gave British development and production of naviga­ tion aids for bombing a very high priority. A variety of aids were introduced to facilitate navigation, each with the hope that it also would improve bombing accuracy at night or in non-visual conditions. Although each improved bombing accuracy to the extent of a significant increase in the percentage of bombs plotted within three miles of their aiming point, none proved adequate for precision bombing; essentially they were navigation and area target-finding devices. All entered service within a short time: Gee, on 8 March 1942; Oboe Mark I in December 1942; Gee-H, 3 November 1943; Oboe Mark II, October 1943; Oboe Mark III, April 1944; H2X (lOcm), 30 January 1943; H2X (the 3cm US version), 2 November 1943; and the x-band H2S Mark III (British 3cm version), 18 November 1943. Their introduction was an integral part of the build-up of Allied bomber forces. Each had its limitations, some by range and suscepti­ bility to enemy countermeasures (Gee, Oboe), others by complexity of crew training and operation (H2S/H2X).'7 The device in which the greatest expectation was placed was H2S ground­ mapping radar, an unlimited range device that used the echo of radar waves to show th

In August 1941 the newly-formed US Air War Plans Division, borrowing heavily from British data and experience, using bombing range probable errors for US bombardment units for June through December 1940 multiplied by a factor of 2.25 squared, or five times peacetime bombing (to estimate the influence of enemy defences and other combat effects on bombing accuracy), offered calculations as to the probability of success in attack of a target 100 by 100 feet (10,000 sq. ft.) in size. Its calculations were that, bombing from 20,000 feet with 500lb or 1 ,OOOlb bombs, a single hit under visual conditions would require a force of 220 bombers. The proba­ bility of at least one hit by a Combat Wing (54 aircraft) dropping 108 bombs was 75 per cent.• The American air leadership nonetheless persisted in emphasising the superior accuracy of its bombing potential over that of RAF Bomber Command's night offensive.

Its development and employment by Britains and the United States followed fundamentally different paths, leading to very different results in bombing accuracy by the two heavy bomber forces. The RAF introduced H2S in 1942 as an aid to navigation and as a low­ precision radar bombsight. Its first operational use by Bomber Command was on the night of 30-31 January 1943, against Hamburg. H2S-equipped Pathfinder aircraft dropped target-indicator bombs and improved sky-marker flares on the target area; follow-on aircraft bombed visually and individually on the flares. Bomber Command efforts also benefited from measures taken by No.5 Group to develop off-set marking, whereby a datum point up-wind from the target was marked and used by the main force as its aiming point, with a 'false wind' setting on the bomb sights being made so that the bombs could be brought on to the true aiming point. Accuracy was enhanced by overall control of 'an attack by a Master Bomber, who directed progress by radio.

Long-range contracts were awarded to RCA, Sperry and Bell in 1941. The need for such equipment for the European Theater of Operations remained unanticipated until 1942, and lacked emphasis until late in that year, when radar-equipped (Pathfinder) aircraft leading heavy bomber formations were considered.

The first step taken by US experts was to familiarise them­ selves with British radar programmes of possible benefit to heavy bomber operations. Trial installation of H2S was requested, followed by a request for eight H2S units in March 1943. When British commitments to furnish H2S in adequate numbers for Eighth Air Force could not be met, a crash programme began in June 1943 at the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology yielded the improved 3cm American H2X. Two B-17s equipped with British H2S flew their first mission on 27 September 1943, leading 244 B-17s against a cloud-covered Emden. This began a change in bombing practice: aircraft bombed by wing (three or more combat boxes) on signal of the H2S/X-equipped Pathfinder aircraft, breaking into combat boxes only if it was possible to bomb visually. Wing formation bombing increased the bomb pattern over the target area, and reduced accuracy; average circular error on the Emden mission was more than five miles." The USA leadership underwent a philosophical change of heart in October 1943. Impressed with the results of the combined attacks on Hamburg in late July 1943 and the disastrous losses suffered by Eighth Air Force in its 17 August attack on Schweinfurt-Regensburg, area attacks on city centres gained appeal at all levels of command.

On 1 November 1943 Army Air Force chief General H. H. Arnold ordered heavy bomber forces to execute area attacks against selective targets when visual bombing was not possible. Mindful of public image, Arnold directed that H2X bombing not be characterised as 'blind bombing'.

RAF missions against oil and transportation targets were executed both at night and during the day as precision rather than area attacks. The night or adverse weather precision attack capabilities that Bomber Command had developed over the preceding 18 months paid dividends on more than one occasion; at times No.3 Group (employing Gee-H) was the only Allied air element capable of supporting Allied ground forces through the bad weather during the Ardennes counter-offensive. 37 Bomber Command improved its performance quantitatively and qualita­ tively. Between April 1943 and April 1945 the sortie rate experienced a three and a half-fold increase, while accuracy increased threefold. In April 1943, 30 per cent of the bombs fell within three miles of the aiming point, com­ pared to 90 per cent two years later. Together, there was a tenfold increase in performance. Accuracy was not as great as it had been in its attacks on lightly defended targets in France and the Low Countries, being affected by flak density and a commensurate altitude increase, but greatly improved over 1943 performances.'"

But neither selective attack nor precision bombing had been abandoned. A chain of events was to enable Bomber Command to open a parallel selective attack effort that would enhance its accuracy. A Pathfinder Force had been established within Bomber Command in August 1942 as a target-finding force; it proved invaluable after initially failing to live up to expectations. During 1943 it improved its ability to mark targets for the main force. The sudden increase in accuracy in early 1943 (Figure 2)33 can be attributed to operational use of Oboe and H2S, and use of target indicator markers as a ground-marking technique. In the spring 1943 Oboe campaign against Ruhr targets, 73 per cent of the attacking bombers placed their bombs within three miles of the aiming point; in the autumn 1943 H2S campaign against more distant cities, 55 per cent of the attacking force bombed within three miles of their aiming points. On 24 March 1943, No.617 Squadron was formed to carry out a night low­ level precision attack against three Ruhr Valley dams. The mission was executed on 16 May 1943, with moderate success. Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Bomber Command, dis­ liked corps d' elite, but agreed to maintain No.617 Squadron for similar tasks. Other requirements came for 617 Squadron and No.8 Group's Pathfinder Force in rapid succession -attacks on aircraft factories, marshalling yards, choke points on the German river and canal system, the battleship Tirpitz, Peenemiinde V-weapons establishment, and the December 1943-January 1944 'Crossbow' attacks on V1 sites, for example -leading to further refine­ ments in capability and accuracy. From 1943 to the end of 1944, relative density (per 1,000 tons dropped) at the aiming point

The former placed emphasis on an absolute minimum of collateral civilian injury; it required specialised techniques, leading to performances that were frequently more accurate than daylight visual attacks by Eighth Air Force. Improved target marking (more than bomb aiming) resulted in a 165 per cent increase in accuracy in marshalling yard attacks of May 1944 over those executed in March, which in and of themselves had set new standards for night-time accuracy. 35 The attacks in support of Allied ground forces showed the same distinction between US and British bombing forces that generally occurred in precision attacks against selective targets: while Eighth Air Force employed combat boxes from high altitude that bombed on the leader's signal, RAF Bomber Command aircraft executed medium and low altitude individual attacks aim­ ing at target indicators delivered on to the target by pathfinder aircraft. Night­ time attacks proved more accurate than USAAF daylight visual bombing, and with a greater density of bombs at the aiming point. This encouraged the Air Staff to press Bomber Command towards greater emphasis on selective bombing, an effort that proved not entirely successful. Whilst resisting Air Staff pressure and persisting in his general area offensive, Air Chief Marshal Harris nonetheless in May 1944 initiated a general drive on bombing accuracy. In June, Bomber Command began further experimentation with precision bombing by individual 'ordinary' (non-Pathfinder) squadrons, with impressive results; these included day bombing attacks against tactical and 'Crossbow' targets during the summer of 1944. By the time Bomber Command and Eighth Air Force could return to a strategic offensive against Germany in the autumn of 1944, Bomber Command's abilities to execute night-time and daylight precision attacks had been estab1ished.36 Autumn 1944: The Re
